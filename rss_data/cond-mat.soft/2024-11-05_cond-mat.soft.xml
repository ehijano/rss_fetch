      <title>Vertex pinning and stretching of single molecule DNA in a linear polymer solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapping, linearization, and imaging of single molecule DNA is of broad interest to both biophysicists who study polymer physics and engineers who build nucleic acid analyzing methods such as optical mapping. In this study, single DNA molecules in a neutral linear polymer solution were driven with an axial electric field through microchannels and their dynamics were studied using fluorescence microscopy. We observed that above a threshold electric field, individual DNA molecules become pinned to the channel walls at a vertex on each molecule and are stretched in the direction opposite to the electric field. Upon removal of the electric field, pinned DNA molecules undergo relaxation within a few seconds to a Brownian coil around the vertex. After 10s of seconds, DNA is released and free to electromigrate. The method enables high quality imaging of single-molecule DNA with high throughput using simple-to-fabricate fluidic structures. We analyze the conditions needed for trapping, relaxation dynamics, and the repeatability of vertex pinning. We hypothesize DNA entangles with neutral linear polymers adsorbed to walls. We hypothesize that a sufficiently high electric force on the DNA is required to expel a hydration layer between the DNA and the wall-adsorbed neutral linear polymers. The elimination of the hydration layer may increase the friction between charged DNA and the uncharged polymer, promoting vertex pinning of DNA.</description>

      <title>The nature of the hydrophobic interaction varies as the solute size increases from methane's to C60's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrophobic interaction, often combined with the hydrophilic or ionic interactions, makes the behavior of aqueous solutions very rich and plays an important role in biological systems. Theoretical and computer simulation studies haven shown that the water-mediated force depends strongly on the size and other chemical properties of the solute, but how it changes with these factors remains unclear. We report here a computer simulation study that illustrates how the hydrophobic pair interaction and the entropic and enthalpic terms change with the solute size when the solute-solvent weak attractive interaction is unchanged with the solute size. The nature of the hydrophobic interaction changes qualitatively as the solute size increases from that of methane to that of fullerene. The potential of mean force between small solutes has several well-defined extrema including the third minimum whereas the potential of mean force between large solutes has the deep contact minimum and the large free-energy barrier between the contact and the water-bilayer separated configurations. The difference in the potential of mean force is related to the differences in the water density, energy, and hydrogen bond number distributions in the vicinity of the pairs of hydrophobic solutes.</description>

      <title>The Geometry behind the Two-Dimensional Hard-Disk 'Glass Transition'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between dynamics and structure in systems of bidisperse 2D hard disks with apparent arrested dynamics is considered using numerical simulations and Voronoi analysis. Surprisingly, the suspensions systematically appear to fall out of equilibrium at an area fraction of {\phi} {\approx} 0.777 over a wide range of disk-size ratios. This is in close agreement with the experimental findings of [Lozano et al., Nat. Mater. 18, 1118 (2019)] for a single large-to-small size ratio of {\approx} 1.4. Even inside the crystalline region of the state diagram there are weak structural signatures present for this area fraction. Adopting a granocentric viewpoint, this allows for the identification of a geometric feature - a floret pentagonal tiling - that could underlie the observations. That is, this tiling has an area fraction of {\phi} {\approx} 0.777343, which closely matches the apparent 'glass transition' value of {\phi}. The connection suggests that a zero-entropy, ground-state tiling can influence the dynamics of the system at finite temperature, in a manner that may be similar to the way in which geometry in foam-like tissue models induces a jamming transition. A geometric ground-state argument also appears to explain the change in local dynamics observed by [Li et al., Nature 587, 225 (2020)], when a honeycomb lattice is used as the reference. Combined these findings change how to view high-{\phi} 2D fluids, namely as being influenced by the presence of zero-entropy geometric ground states. The proposed connection leads to an unexpected (dynamic) transition in the finite-temperature system, which can be mistaken for a(n onset) glass transition, but is in a class of its own. There is also a tentative connection to random loose packing for frictional systems. An outlook is provided on how this concept may be extended to soft-particle systems and into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Discrete Element Simulations of particles interacting via capillary forces using MercuryDPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of two advanced capillary bridge approximations within the Discrete Element Method (DEM) framework of the open-source code MercuryDPM. While MercuryDPM already includes a simplified version of the Willett approximation, our work involves implementing both the classical Willett approximation and the recently published Bagheri approximation in MercuryDPM. Through detailed descriptions and illustrative simulations using a two-particle collision model, we demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and capabilities of these approximations in capturing the complex dynamics of wet granular matter.</description>

      <title>Crystallization kinetics of equimolar liquid crystalline mixture and its components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new equimolar mixture comprises liquid crystalline compounds MHPOBC and partially fluorinated 3F2HPhF6. The phase sequence of the mixture is determined by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The enantiotropic smectic A*, C*, and CA* phases are observed for the mixture. Only partial crystallization of the mixture is observed during cooling at 2-40 K/min and the remaining smectic CA* phase undergoes vitrification. In contrast, the crystallization of the pure components is complete or almost complete for the same range of cooling rates. The kinetics of the non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization of the mixture and pure components are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The non-isothermal data are analyzed by the isoconversional method, while the isothermal data are analyzed using the Avrami model. Typically, the nucleation-controlled crystallization kinetics are observed.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural networks applied to differential dynamic microscopy reduces noise when quantifying heterogeneous dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) typically relies on movies containing hundreds or thousands of frames to accurately quantify motion in soft matter systems. Using movies much shorter in duration produces noisier and less accurate results. This limits the applicability of DDM to situations where the dynamics are stationary over extended times. Here, we investigate a method to denoise the DDM process, particularly suited to when a limited number of imaging frames are available or when dynamics are quickly evolving in time. We use a convolutional neural network encoder-decoder (CNN-ED) model to reduce the noise in the intermediate scattering function that is computed via DDM. We demonstrate this approach of combining machine learning and DDM on samples containing diffusing micron-sized colloidal particles. We quantify how the particles' diffusivities change over time as the fluid they are suspended in gels. We also quantify how the diffusivity of particles varies with position in a sample containing a viscosity gradient. These test cases demonstrate how studies of non-equilibrium dynamics and high-throughput screens could benefit from a method to denoise the outputs of DDM.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric nematics: Materials with high permittivity or low resistivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two models have recently been proposed for a description of dielectric spectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric nematics (NF) in thin planar capacitors. The polarization-external capacitance Goldstone reorientation mode (PCG model) considers the NF layer between the electrodes as an effective low resistivity material, the resistivity being inversely proportional to the square of polarisation magnitude. The high-{\epsilon} model considers the NF material as having a huge permittivity due to the ease of polarisation rotation. In this paper we study implications of both models and show, why both models describe majority of the observed dielectric spectroscopy results equally well. We point out differences among the models predictions and explain why some observations can be explained only by the high-{\epsilon} model. The major difference between the models is that the high-{\epsilon} model predicts that the increase in the cell thickness can lead to an increase in the frequency range within which capacitors filled with NF material can be used for energy storage while within the PCG model this frequency range reduces with increasing capacitor thickness. Within both models a crucial parameter which determines the behaviour of the capacitors filled with a NF material is parasitic resistance, primarily due to the electrode resistance. We present measurements of electrode resistance and find that in ITO cells it is of the order of few hundred ohms.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal fluctuations in the passive and active Riesz gas on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic Riesz gas consisting of $N$ classical particles on a circle, interacting via a two-body repulsive potential which behaves locally as a power law of the distance, $\sim g/|x|^s$ for $s&gt;-1$. Long range (LR) interactions correspond to $s&lt;1$, short range (SR) interactions to $s&gt;1$, while the cases $s=0$ and $s=2$ describe the well-known log-gas and the Calogero-Moser (CM) model respectively. We study the fluctuations of the positions around the equally spaced crystal configuration, both for Brownian and run-and-tumble particles (RTP). Focusing on the regime of weak noise, we obtain exact expressions for the space-time correlations, both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, for $N \gg 1$ and at fixed mean density $\rho$. They are characterized by a dynamical exponent $z_s=\min(1+s,2)$. We also obtain the gap statistics, described by a roughness exponent $\zeta_s=\frac{1}{2} \min(s,1)$. For $s&gt;0$ in the Brownian case, we find that in a broad time window, the mean square displacement of a particle is sub-diffusive as $t^{1/2}$ for SR as in single-file diffusion, and $t^{s/(1+s)}$ for LR interactions. Remarkably, this coincides, including the amplitude, with a recent prediction obtained using macroscopic fluctuation theory. These results also apply to RTPs beyond a time-scale $1/\gamma$, with $\gamma$ the tumbling rate, and a characteristic length-scale. Instead, for either shorter times or shorter distances, the active noise leads to a rich variety of static and dynamical regimes, with distinct exponents. For $-1&lt;s&lt;0$, the displacements are bounded, leading to true crystalline order at weak noise. The melting transition, recently observed numerically, is discussed in light of our calculation. Finally, we extend our method to the active Dyson Brownian motion and active CM model in a harmonic trap, generalizing to finite $\gamma$ the results of our earlier work.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Interface Effects in Composite Dielectrics: Insights into Charge Trapping Regulation through Multiscale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of modern energy applications drives an urgent need to enhance the dielectric strength of energy storage dielectrics for higher power density. Interface design is a promising strategy to regulate the crucial charge transport process determining dielectric strength. However, the targeted exploitation of interface effects on charge transport is limited due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms involving elementary electronic processes and details of the intricate interplay of characteristics of molecular building blocks and the interfacial morphology -- details that cannot fully be resolved with experimental methods. Here we employ a multiscale modeling approach linking the quantum properties of the charge carriers with nano- and mesoscale structural details of complex interfaces. Applied to a prototypical application-proven cellulose-oil composite with interfaces formed between oil, disordered, and crystalline cellulose regions, this approach demonstrates that charges are trapped in the disordered region. Specifically, it unveils this trapping as a synergistic effect of two transport-regulating interface mechanisms: back-transfer to the oil region is suppressed by energetic factors, while forward-transfer to the crystalline cellulose is suppressed by low electronic coupling. The insight into the molecular origins of interface effects via dual-interface regulation offers new development paths for advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling and imaging of thin curved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin films or sheets subjected to external forces often undergo mechanical instability, leading to regular patterns of wrinkles, folds, and creases. As can be anticipated from the difficulty of flattening a curved globe, any natural curvature of the sheet will have a strong influence on these instabilities. Here, we develop a non-invasive synthetic schlieren imaging technique to image and reconstruct the surface of wrinkling curved sheets, confined to float on water. Our method circumvents the small-amplitude limit of related imaging techniques, and we demonstrate robust means to estimate the reconstruction accuracy. We then evaluate how the sign and magnitude of Gaussian curvature affects the wrinkling of thin curved sheets, and compare observations of the wrinkle wavelength, amplitude and domain structure with recent theoretical predictions. While generally validating model predictions, we find that the assumption of a conserved surface area during wrinkling should be treated with some care. The control of wrinkling behavior demonstrated here can have application in design of liquid lenses, microfluidics, active textured surfaces, and flexible electronic components.</description>

      <title>Quench switching of Mn2As</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that epitaxial thin film antiferromagnet Mn2As exhibits the quench-switching effect, which was previously reported only in crystallographically similar antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films. Quench switching in Mn2As shows stronger increase in resistivity, reaching hundreds of percent at 5K, and significantly longer retention time of the metastable high-resistive state before relaxation towards the low-resistive uniform magnetic state. Qualitatively, Mn2As and CuMnAs show analogous parametric dependence of the magnitude and relaxation of the quench-switching signal. Quantitatively, relaxation dynamics in both materials show direct proportionality to the N\'eel temperature. This confirms that the quench switching has magnetic origin in both materials. The presented results suggest that the antiferromagnets crystalizing in the Cu2Sb structure are well suited for exploring and exploiting the intriguing physics of highly non-uniform magnetic states associated with the quench switching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative robotic device designed to provide controlled motion for studying active matter. Motion is driven by an internal vibrator powered by a small rechargeable battery. The system integrates acoustic and magnetic sensors along with a programmable microcontroller. Unlike conventional vibrobots, the motor induces horizontal vibrations, resulting in cycloidal trajectories that have been characterized and optimized. Portions of these orbits can be utilized to create specific motion patterns. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how this versatile system can be exploited to develop active particles with varying dynamics, ranging from ballistic motion to run-and-tumble diffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>Colloidal quasi-2D Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanostructures with Tunable Shape and High Chemical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over the lateral dimensions of colloidal nanostructures is a complex task which requires a deep understanding of the formation mechanism and reactivity in the corresponding systems. As a result, it provides a well-founded insight to the physical and chemical properties of these materials. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of quasi-2D methylammonium lead bromide nanostripes and discuss the influence of some specific parameters on the morphology and stability of this material. The variation in the amount of the main ligand dodecylamine gives a large range of structures beginning with 3D brick-like particles at low concentrations, nanostripes at elevated and ultimately nanosheets at large concentrations. The amount of the co-ligand trioctylphosphine can alter the width of the nanostripe shape to a certain degree. The thickness can be adjusted by the amount of the second precursor methylammonium bromide. Additionally, insights are given for the suggested formation mechanism of these anisotropic structures as well as for stability against moisture at ambient conditions in comparison with differently synthesized nanosheet samples.</description>

      <title>Modelling floral and arthropod electrostatics using a two-domain AAA-least squares algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through co-evolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, colour and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modelling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.</description>

Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain, which is theoretically well understood. Here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to finite temperatures for a very broad class of under-constrained systems. In the vicinity of the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles expressions for elastic properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ on temperature $T$, isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, and shear strain $\gamma$, which we confirm numerically. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain, which can be determined from the microstructure of the system. Our results imply that in under-constrained systems, entropic and energetic rigidity interact like two springs in series. This also allows for a simple explanation of the previously numerically observed scaling relation $t\sim G\sim T^{1/2}$ at $\varepsilon=\gamma=0$. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Time reversibility during the ageing of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical ageing is the generic term for irreversible processes in glassy materials resulting from molecular rearrangements. One formalism for describing such ageing processes involves the concept of material time, which may be thought of as time measured on a clock whose rate changes as the glass ages. Experimental determination of material time has so far not been realized, however. Here, we show how dynamic light-scattering measurements provide a way forward. We determined the material time for an ageing sample of the glass-former 1-phenyl-1-propanol after temperature jumps close to the glass transition from the time-autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations probed by multispeckle dynamic light scattering. These fluctuations are shown to be stationary and reversible when regarded as a function of the material time. The glass-forming colloidal synthetic clay Laponite and a chemically ageing curing epoxy are also shown to display material-time-reversible scattered-light intensity fluctuations, and simulations of an ageing binary system monitoring the potential energy confirm material-time reversibility. In addition to demonstrating direct measurements of the material time, our findings identify a fundamental property of ageing in quite different contexts that presents a challenge to the current theories of ageing.</description>

      <title>Effective single particle dynamics in active matter systems using local density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a top-down approach to theoretically model the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of active disks and use this model to derive the effective dynamics of a single particle. By analyzing clustering dynamics in simulations, we introduce a local density variable that captures interaction effects. We numerically calculate the mean and temporal auto-correlation of local density in the steady state, and use these to analytically derive an exact expression for a particle's diffusivity as a function of global packing density. Remarkably, our effective model closely matches numerical diffusivity in high packing density regime where prominent clusters are formed and shows striking agreements with the well-known existence of phase transition beyond a critical packing density. This model could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

      <title>Analytical prediction for the steady-state behavior of a confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steady-state behavior of a single drop under shear flow has been extensively investigated in the limit of small deformation and negligible inertia effects. In this work, we combine the calculations proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity, with those by Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. By merging these two approaches, we provide comprehensive analytical predictions for steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle across a wide range of physical conditions, from confined to unconfined droplets, including or excluding the effect of interface viscosity. The proposed analytical predictions are also robust concerning variations in the viscosity ratio, making our model general enough to include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>Water Drop on Thin Viscous Oil Layers: From Stick-Slip Spreading to Dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of water droplets on thin layers of immiscible viscous liquids, such as oil films, is commonly encountered across contexts ranging from kitchen activities to industrial processes. In this study, we experimentally investigate the short-term and long-term behavior of water drops spreading on silicone oil-coated surfaces. During the initial spreading, especially towards zero impact energies, the drop edge exhibits stick-slip dynamics, characterized by intermittent stops. The stick-slip behaviour diminishes with increasing spreading energy from impacts, where the drop spreads without noticeably displacing the oil layer. In the long-term dynamics, regardless of whether the spreading is gradual or impact-driven, the drop eventually spreads onto the surface under the oil layer, governed by the dewetting dynamics of the oil. The delay for the second spreading is independent of the Weber number, indicating that the impact initially does not significantly deform the oil layer. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of water-oil interactions, with implications for both practical applications and fundamental research.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. For nonlocal hydrodynamics, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. Using a temporal integrator developed in previous work, we demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively. In the latter case, we show that the effect of hydrodynamics can be accounted for through steric repulsion.</description>
