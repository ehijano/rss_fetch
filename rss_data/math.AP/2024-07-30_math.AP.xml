      <title>Asymptotic profile of least energy solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger--Bopp--Podolsky system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \[ \begin{cases} - \Delta v + v + \phi v = v |v|^{p - 2}; \\ \beta^2 \Delta^2 \phi - \Delta \phi = 4 \pi v^2, \end{cases} \] where $\beta &gt; 0$ and $3 &lt; p &lt; 6$, the unknowns being $v$, $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$. We prove that, as $\beta \to 0$ and up to translations and subsequences, least energy solutions to this system converge to a least energy solution to the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger--Poisson system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \[ \begin{cases} - \Delta v + v + \phi v = v |v|^{p - 2}; \\ - \Delta \phi = 4 \pi v^2. \end{cases} \]</description>

      <title>Local exact Lagrangian controllability for 1D barotropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19210v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a viscous compressible barotropic flow in the interval $[0,\pi]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the flow velocity and a constant rest state as initial data. Given two sufficiently close subintervals $I=[\alpha_1,\alpha_2]$ and $J=[\beta_1,\beta_2]$ of $(0,1)$, a nonempty open set $\omega \subset (1,\pi)$, and $T&gt;0$, we construct an external force $f$ supported in $\omega$ acting on the momentum equation such that the corresponding flow map moves the fluid particles initially occupying $I$ exactly onto $J$ in time $T$.</description>

      <title>KAM for high-dimensional nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study high-dimensional nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator equation. We show the equation admits many time quasi-periodic solutions by establishing an abstract infinite dimensional KAM theorem with multiple normal frequencies. The proof is based on the classical KAM scheme, and the key is a decaying structure of Hessian matrices of Hamiltonian functions.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality along Felli-Schneider curve: critical points at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (CKN for short) inequality \begin{eqnarray*} \bigg(\int_{{\mathbb R}^d}|x|^{-b(p+1)}|u|^{p+1}dx\bigg)^{\frac{2}{p+1}}\leq S_{a,b}\int_{{\mathbb R}^d}|x|^{-2a}|\nabla u|^2dx, \end{eqnarray*} where $u\in D^{1,2}_{a}({\mathbb R}^d)$, $d\geq2$, $p=\frac{d+2(1+a-b)}{d-2(1+a-b)}$ and \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq0003} \left\{\aligned &amp;a&lt;b&lt;a+1,\quad d=2,\\ &amp;a\leq b&lt;a+1,\quad d\geq3. \endaligned \right. \end{eqnarray} Based on the ideas of \cite{DSW2024,FP2024}, we develop a suitable strategy to derive the following sharp stability of the critical points at infinity of the above CKN inequality in the degenerate case $d\geq2$, $b=b_{FS}(a)$ (Felli-Schneider curve) and $a&lt;0$: let $\nu \in {\mathbb N}$ and $u\in D^{1,2}_{a}({\mathbb R}^d)$ be an nonnegative function such that \begin{eqnarray}\label{eqqqnew0001} \left(\nu-\frac12\right)\left(S_{a,b}^{-1}\right)^{\frac{p+1}{p-1}}&lt;\|u\|^2_{D^{1,2}_a({\mathbb R}^d)}&lt;\left(\nu+\frac12\right)\left(S_{a,b}^{-1}\right)^{\frac{p+1}{p-1}} \end{eqnarray} Then we have the following sharp inequality \begin{eqnarray*} \inf_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{\nu}\in\left({\mathbb R}_+\right)^{\nu}, \overrightarrow{\lambda}_{\nu}\in {\mathbb R}^\nu}\left\|u-\sum_{j=1}^{\nu}\alpha_j W_{\lambda_j}\right\|\lesssim\left\|-div(|x|^{-a}\nabla u)-|x|^{-b(p+1)}|u|^{p-1}u\right\|_{W^{-1,2}_a({\mathbb R}^d)}^{\frac{1}{3}} \end{eqnarray*} as $\left\|-div(|x|^{-a}\nabla u)-|x|^{-b(p+1)}|u|^{p-1}u\right\|_{W^{-1,2}_a({\mathbb R}^d)}\to0$. The significant finding in our result is that in the degenerate case, {\it the power of the optimal stability is an absolute constant $1/3$} (independent of $p$ and $\nu$) which is quite different from the non-degenerate case \cite{DSW2024,WW2022}.</description>

      <title>Timelike asymptotics for global solutions to a scalar quasilinear wave equation satisfying the weak null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the timelike asymptotics for global solutions to a scalar quasilinear wave equation satisfying the weak null condition. Given a global solution $u$ to the scalar wave equation with sufficiently small $C_c^\infty$ initial data, we derive an asymptotic formula for this global solution inside the light cone (i.e. for $|x|&lt;t$). It involves the scattering data obtained in the author's asymptotic completeness result in arXiv:2105.11573. Using this asymptotic formula, we prove that $u$ must vanish under some decaying assumptions on $u$ or its scattering data, provided that the wave equation violates the null condition.</description>

      <title>On asymptotics of Robin eigenvalues in the Dirichlet limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, when the (positive) Robin parameter is diverging. In this framework, since the convergence of the Robin eigenvalues to the Dirichlet ones is known, we address the question of quantifying the rate of such convergence. More precisely, in this work we identify the proper geometric quantity representing (asymptotically) the first term in the expansion of the eigenvalue variation: it is a novel notion of torsional rigidity. Then, by performing a suitable asymptotic analysis of both such quantity and its minimizer, we prove the first-order expansion of any Robin eigenvalue, in the Dirichlet limit. Moreover, the convergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions is obtained as well. We remark that all our spectral estimates are explicit and sharp, and cover both the cases of convergence to simple and multiple Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Two-phase problems: Perron solutions and regularity of the Neumann problem in convex cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a fully nonlinear two-phase free boundary problem with a Neumann boundary condition on the boundary of a general convex set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with corners. We show that the interior regularity theory developed by Caffarelli for the classical two-phase problem in his pioneer works \cite{C1,C2}, can be extended up to the boundary for the Neumann boundary condition under very mild regularity assumptions on the convex domain $K$. To start, we establish a general existence theorem for the Dirichlet two-phase problem driven by two different fully nonlinear operators, which is a result of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a system of coupled non-linear PDEs modeling an anisotropic electrokinetic flow. We show the existence of suitable weak solutions in three spatial dimensions, that is weak solutions which fulfill an energy inequality, via a regularized system. The flow is modeled by a Navier--Stokes--Nernst--Planck--Poisson system and the anisotropy is introduced via space dependent diffusion matrices in the Nernst--Planck and Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>Resonant modes of two hard inclusions within a soft elastic material and their stress estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with subwavelength resonant modes of two hard inclusions embedding in soft elastic materials to realize negative materials in elasticity. All the $12$ subwavelength resonant frequencies are derived explicitly for general convex resonators. In addition, the resonant modes are categorized into dipolar, quadrupolar, and hybrid groups, facilitating the effective realization of negative mass density, negative shear modulus and double-negative properties (both mass density and shear modulus) in elastic metamaterials. Moreover, we analyze the stress distribution between two hard inclusions when they are closely touching. We also precisely derive the sharp blow-up rates of the gradient estimates of the resonant modes. Our findings show that certain resonant modes have bounded stress estimates when the curvature of the hard inclusions is appropriately designed. These results provide valuable insights into the stability of the design and fabrication of elastic metamaterials. Lastly, we express the scattering wave fields explicitly in terms of resonant modes, offering a clear understanding of their impact on the overall scattering behavior.</description>

      <title>Normalized NLS ground states on a double plane hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the properties of normalized ground states of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum hybrid formed by two planes connected at a point. The nonlinearities are of power type and $L^2$-subcritical, while the matching condition between the two planes generates two point interactions of different strengths on each plane, together with a coupling condition between the two planes. We prove that ground states exist for every value of the mass and two different qualitative situations are possible depending on the matching condition: either ground states concentrate on one of the plane only, or ground states distribute on both the planes and are positive, radially symmetric, decreasing and present a logarithmic singularity at the origin of each plane. Moreover, we discuss how the mass distributes on the two planes and compare the strengths of the logarithmic singularities on the two planes when the parameters of the matching condition and the powers of the nonlinear terms vary.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study existence and regularity of solutions to Dirichlet problems as

  \begin{cases}
  - {\rm div}\left(|u|^m\frac{D u}{|D u|}\right) = f &amp; \text{in}\;\Omega,\\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on}\;\partial\Omega,

  $$
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$) with Lipschitz boundary, $m&gt;0$, and $f$ belongs to the Lorentz space $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$. In particular, we explore the regularizing effect given by the degenerate coefficient $|u|^m$ in order to get non-trivial and bounded solutions with no smallness assumptions on the size of the data.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow up for the energy critical Zakharov system I: approximate solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct approximate solutions $ (\psi_*, n_*)$ of the critical 4D Zakharov system which collapse in finite time to a singular renormalization of the solitary bulk solutions $ (\lambda e^{i \theta}W, \lambda^2 W^2)$ . To be precise for $ N \in \mathbb{Z}_+,\;N \gg1 $ we obtain a magnetic envelope/ion density pair of the form
  $$ \psi_*(t, x)= e^{i\alpha(t)}\lambda(t) W(\lambda(t)x) + \eta(t, x), \;n_*(t,x) = \lambda^2(t) W^2(\lambda(t) x) + \chi(t,x), $$
  where $ W(x) = (1 + \frac{|x|^2}{8})^{-1}$, $\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \log(t)$, $\lambda(t)= t^{-\frac{1}{2}-\nu}$ with large $\nu &gt; 1 $ and further
  $$
  i \partial_t \psi_* + \Delta \psi_* + n_* \psi_* = \mathcal{O}(t^N),\; \Box n_* - \Delta (|\psi_*|^2) = \mathcal{O}(t^N),\;\;\eta(t) \to \eta_0, \chi(t) \to \chi_0,
  $$
  as $ t \to 0^+$ in a suitable sense. The method of construction is inspired by matched asymptotic regions and approximation procedures in the context of blow up solutions introduced by the first author jointly with W. Schlag and D. Tataru, as well as the subsequently developed methods in the Schr\"odinger context by G. Perelman et al.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow up for the energy critical Zakharov system II: exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our companion paper [Krieger-Schmid, 2024], we show that the 4D energy critical Zakharov system admits finite time type II blow up solutions. The main new difficulty this work deals with is the appearance of a term in the linearization around the approximate solution, which is non-local with respect to both space and time. In particular this cannot be handled by straightforward adaptation of the methods developed in [Krieger-Schlag-Tataru, 2008/09]. The key new ingredients we use are a type of approximate modulation theory, taking advantage of frequency localisations, and the exploitation of an inhomogeneous wave equation with both a non-local, as well as a local potential term. These terms arise for the main non-perturbative component of the ion density $n$ and can be solved via inversion of a certain Fredholm type operator, as well as by using distorted Fourier methods. Our result relies on a number of numerical non-degeneracy assumptions.</description>

      <title>Remark on the local well-posedness for NLS with the modulated dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the modulated dispersion and power type nonlinearities in any spatial dimensions. We adapt the Young integral theory developed by Chouk-Gubinelli [K. Chouk and M, Gubinelli, Comm. Partial Differential Equations 40 (2015)] and multilinear estimates which are based on divisor counting, and show the local well-posedness. Our result generalizes the result by Chouk-Gubinelli.</description>

      <title>An implicit two-phase obstacle-type problem for the $p$-Laplacian with the fractional gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study an inhomogeneous two-phase obstacle-type problem associated to the $s$-fractional $p$-Laplacian. Besides the existence and uniqueness of solutions, we study the convergence of the solutions when $s\to 1$ to the classical problem. We also study the continuous dependence with respect to the level-set function $v$, yielding an existence result for a two-phase obstacle-type problem with an implicit level-set function.</description>

      <title>Regularity theory for fully nonlinear equations of porous medium-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the regularity results for nonnegative viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear equations of porous medium-type in bounded domains with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition, to be precise, we prove the global $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimates of viscosity solutions. In many PDE problems, the $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimates have been obtained through Schauder-type estimates. However, the Schauder-type estimates are not applicable to the porous medium-type equations. We provide techniques for handling porous medium-type equations so that the global $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimates can be established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study the harmonic curves on domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^1$. These are the $C^2$-regular mappings which are critical points of the second Dirichlet energy and satisfy the weak isotropicity condition. We investigate the geometry of such curves including the comparison and maximum principles, the Harnack inequalities, the Liouville theorems, the existence results, the Phragm\`en-Lindel\"of theorem, as well as the three spheres theorem.</description>

      <title>F-stability, entropy and energy gap for supercritical Fujita equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some problems on self similar solutions to the Fujita equation when $p&gt;(n+2)/(n-2)$, especially, the characterization of constant solutions by the energy. Motivated by recent advances in mean curvature flows, we introduce the notion of $F-$functional, $F$-stability and entropy for solutions of supercritical Fujita equation. Using these tools, we prove that among bounded positive self similar solutions, the constant solution has the lowest entropy. Furthermore, there is also a gap between the entropy of constant and non-constant solutions. As an application of these results, we prove that if $p&gt;(n+2)/(n-2)$, then the blow up set of type I blow up solutions is the union of a $(n-1)-$ rectifiable set and a set of Hausdorff dimension at most $n-3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic equation $-\Delta u+ u=0$ in a bounded, smooth domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^{2}$ subject to the nonlinear Neumann boundary condition $\partial u/\partial\nu = |u|^{p-1}u$ on $\partial\Omega$ and study the asymptotic behavior as the exponent $p\rightarrow +\infty$ of families of positive solutions $u_p$ satisfying uniform energy bounds. We prove energy quantization and characterize the boundary concentration. In particular we describe the local asymptotic profile of the solutions around each concentration point and get sharp convergence results for the $L^{\infty}$-norm.</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the minimization property of a Gagliardo-Slobodeckij seminorm which can be seen as the fractional counterpart of the classical problem of functions of least gradient and which is related to the minimization of the nonlocal perimeter functional.
  We discuss continuity properties for this kind of problem. In particular, we show that, under natural structural assumptions, the minimizers are bounded and continuous in the interior of the ambient domain (and, in fact, also continuous up to the boundary under some mild additional hypothesis).
  We show that these results are also essentially optimal, since in general the minimizer is not necessarily continuous across the boundary.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 2. 1-D Ohmic Contact Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of the steady-state for a 1-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with Ohmic contact boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We utilize Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to ensure the global existence of solutions around the steady state. In contrast to the deterministic case, the presence of stochastic forces lead to the lack of temporal derivatives of momentum, posing challenges for energy estimates. Furthermore, Ohmic contact boundary conditions pose greater challenges for energy estimates compared to systems with insulating boundary conditions. To address this issue, we establish asymptotic stability concerning the spatial derivatives through weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from that of the deterministic case. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure based on the a priori energy estimates. This invariant measure precisely corresponds to the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, due to the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state.</description>

      <title>On a Schr\"odinger system with shrinking regions of attraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a competitive weakly coupled elliptic system in which each species is attracted to a small region and repelled from its complement. In this setting, we establish the existence of infinitely many solutions and of a nonnegative least energy solution. We show that, as the regions of attraction shrink, least energy solutions of the system concentrate. We study this behavior and characterize their limit profile. In particular, we show that if each component of a least energy solution is attracted to a different region, then the components decouple in the limit, whereas if all the components are attracted to the same region, they remain coupled.</description>

      <title>Global gradient estimates for solutions of parabolic equations with nonstandard growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the smoothness of the initial datum and the free term affect the global regularity properties of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the class of parabolic equations of $p(x,t)$-Laplace type %with nonlinear sources depending on the solution and its gradient:
  \[ u_t-\Delta_{p(\cdot)}u=f(z)+F(z,u,\nabla u),\quad z=(x,t)\in Q_T=\Omega\times (0,T), \] with the nonlinear source $F(z,u,\nabla u)=a(z)|u|^{q(z)-2}u+|\nabla u|^{s(z)-2}(\vec c,\nabla u)$. It is proven the existence of a solution such that if $|\nabla u(x,0)|\in L^r(\Omega)$ for some $r\geq \max\{2,\max p(z)\}$, then the gradient preserves the initial order of integrability in time, gains global higher integrability, and the solution acquires the second-order regularity in the following sense: \[ \text{$|\nabla u(x,t)|\in L^r(\Omega)$ for a.e. $t \in (0,T)$}, \qquad \text{$|\nabla u|^{p(z)+\rho+r-2} \in L^1(Q_T)$ for any $\rho \in \left(0, \frac{4}{N+2}\right)$}, \] and \[ |\nabla u|^{\frac{p(z)+r}{2}-2}\nabla u\in L^2(0,T;W^{1,2}(\Omega))^N. \] The exponent $r$ is arbitrary and independent of $p(z)$ if $f\in L^{N+2}(Q_T)$, while for $f\in L^\sigma(Q_T)$ with $\sigma \in (2,N+2)$ the exponent $r$ belongs to a bounded interval whose endpoints are defined by $\max p(z)$, $\min p(z)$, $N$, and $\sigma$. An integration by parts formula is also proven, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogenization of 3D non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system in perforated domains with holes of critical size. The diameter of the holes is of size \epsilon^3, where \epsilon is a small parameter measuring the mutual distance between the holes. We show that when \epsilon tends to 0, the velocity and density converge to a solution of the non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system with a friction term of Brinkman type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem that we deal with, is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formulation of the coefficients of the finite resolvent from the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization after proving that it also implies the exponential decay of moments of order $2$ of the resolvent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the three dimensional Euler equations driven by an additive stochastic forcing. First, we construct global H\"{o}lder continuous (stationary) solutions in $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$ space for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ via a different method from \cite{LZ24}. Our approach is based on applying stochastic convex integration to the construction of Euler flows in \cite{DelSze13} to derive uniform moment estimates independent of time. Second, for any divergence-free H\"{o}lder continuous initial condition, we show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $L^p_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);C^{\vartheta'}) \cap C_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);H^{-1})$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ and some $\vartheta'&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a set of relations between several quite diverse types of weighted inequalities involving various integral operators and fairly general quasinorm-like functionals. The main result enables one to solve a specific problem by transferring it to another one for which a solution is known. The main result is formulated in a rather surprising generality, involving previously unknown cases, and it works even for some nonlinear operators such as the geometric or harmonic mean operators. Proofs use only elementary means.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous $N$-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for $N$-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing $N$-phase models and facilitates the computation of $N$-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

The interactions among these populations are described not in terms of random encounters, but via the strategic decisions of one population that can attack the other according to different levels of aggressiveness. This leads to a non-variational model for the two populations at war, taking into account structural parameters such as the relative fit of the two populations with respect to the available resources and the effectiveness of the attack strikes of the aggressive population. The analysis that we perform is rigorous and focuses on the dynamical properties of the system, by detecting and describing all the possible equilibria and their basins of attraction. Moreover, we will analyze the strategies that may lead to the victory of the aggressive population, i.e. the choices of the aggressiveness parameter, in dependence of the structural constants of the system and possibly varying in time in order to optimize the efficacy of the attacks, which take to the extinction in finite time of the defensive population. The model that we present is flexible enough to include also technological competition models of aggressive companies releasing computer viruses to set a rival company out of the market.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a flow of inverse mean curvature type for capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space. We establish the global existence of solutions for this flow and demonstrate that it converges smoothly to a spherical cap as time tends to infinity. As a result, we derive a new Minkowski-type inequality for star-shaped and mean convex capillary hypersurfaces for the whole range of contact angle $\theta\in (0,\pi)$.</description>

      <title>On the number of solutions to the planar dual Minkowski problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual Minkowski problem in the two-dimensional plane is studied in this paper. By combining the theoretical analysis and numerical estimation of an integral with parameters, we find the number of solutions to this problem for the constant dual curvature case when $0&lt;q\leq4$. An improved nonuniqueness result when $q&gt;4$ is also obtained. As an application, a result on the uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions to the $L_p$-Alexandrov problem is obtained for $p&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Particular existence of positive solutions for elliptic equations involving regional fractional Laplacian of order $(0,\frac12]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our purpose of this paper is to investigate positive solutions of the elliptic equation with regional fractional Laplacian $$
  ( - \Delta )_{B_1}^s u +u= h(x,u) \quad
  {\rm in} \ \, B_1,\qquad u\in C_0(B_1),
  $$
  where $( - \Delta )_{B_1}^s$ with $s\in(0,\frac12]$ is the regional fractional Laplacian and $h$ is the nonlinearity.
  Ordinarily, positive solutions vanishing at the boundary are not anticipated to be derived for the equations with regional fractional Laplacian of order $s\in(0,\frac12]$. Positive solutions are obtained when the nonlinearity assumes the following two models:
  $h(x,t)=f(x)$ or $h(x,t)=h_1(x)\, t^p+ \epsilon h_2(x)$, where $p&gt;1$, $\epsilon&gt;0$ small and $f, h_1, h_2$ are H\"older continuous, radially symmetric and decreasing functions under suitable conditions.</description>

Abstract: We prove the stability of three-dimensional axisymmetric solutions to the steady Euler system with transonic shocks in divergent nozzles under perturbations of the exit pressure and the supersonic solution in the upstream region. We first derive a free boundary problem with the newly introduced formulation of the Euler system for three-dimensional axisymmetric flows in divergent nozzles via the method of Helmholtz decomposition. We then construct an iteration scheme and use the Schauder fixed point theorem and weak implicit function theorem to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and stability of the 2D Boussinesq equations with partial dissipation near a hydrostatic equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to investigating the well-posedness, stability and large-time behavior near the hydrostatic balance for the 2D Boussinesq equations with partial dissipation. More precisely, the global well-posedness is obtained in the case of partial viscosity and without thermal diffusion for the initial data belonging to $H^{\delta}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for $\delta \in [s-1,s+1]$ if $s \in \mathbb{R}, s &gt; 2$, for $\delta \in (1,s+1]$ if $s \in (0,2]$ and for $\delta \in [0,1]$ if $s = 0$. In addition, if one has either horizontal or vertical thermal diffusion then the stability and large-time behavior are provided in $H^m(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and in $\dot{H}^{m-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $m \geq 2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On solvability of a time-fractional semilinear heat equation, and its quantitative approach to the classical counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the following time-fractional semilinear heat equation in the $N$-dimensional whole space ${\bf R}^N$ with $N \geq 1$.
  \[
  {\rm (P)}_\alpha \qquad
  \partial_t^\alpha u -\Delta u = u^p,\quad t&gt;0,\,\,\, x\in{\bf R}^N, \qquad
  u(0) = \mu \quad \mbox{in}\quad {\bf R}^N,
  \]
  where $\partial_t^\alpha$ denotes the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$, $p&gt;1$, and $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure on ${\bf R}^N$. The case $\alpha=1$ formally gives the Fujita-type equation (P)$_1$ \ $\partial_tu-\Delta u=u^p$. In particular, we mainly focus on the Fujita critical case where $p=p_F:=1+2/N$. It is well known that the Fujita exponent $p_F$ separates the ranges of $p$ for the global-in-time solvability of (P)$_1$. In particular, (P)$_1$ with $p=p_F$ possesses no global-in-time solutions, and does not locally-in-time solvable in its scale critical space $L^1(\mathbf{R}^N)$. It is also known that the exponent $p_F$ plays the same role for the global-in-time solvability for (P)$_\alpha$. However, the problem (P)$_\alpha$ with $p=p_F$ is globally-in-time solvable, and exhibites local-in-time solvability in its scale critical space $L^1(\mathbf{R}^N)$. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the collapse of the global and local-in-time solvability of (P)$_\alpha$ as $\alpha$ approaches $1-0$.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for incompressible neo-Hookean Elastic equations in almost critical Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a pioneer work of Andersson-Kapitanski \cite{AK}, we prove the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem of incompressible neo-Hookean equations if the initial deformation and velocity belong to $H^{s+1}(\mathbb{R}^n) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^n), s&gt;\frac{n+1}{2}$ ($n=2,3$). Moreover, if the initial data is small, then we can lower the regularity to $s&gt;\frac{n}{2}$, where $\frac{n+2}{2}$ and $\frac{n}{2}$ is respectively a scaling-invariant exponent for deformation and velocity in Sobolev spaces. Our new observation relies on two folds: a reduction to a second-order wave-elliptic system of deformation and velocity; and a "wave-map type" null form intrinsic in this coupled system. In particular, the wave nature with "wave-map type" null form allows us to prove a bilinear estimate of Klainerman-Machedon type for nonlinear terms. So we can lower $\frac12$-order regularity in 3D and $\frac34$-order regularity in 2D for well-posedness compared with \cite{AK}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [17], the authors introduced the space $GBV_\star(A)$ to minimise a class of functionals whose study is motivated by fracture mechanics. In this paper, we extend the definition of $GBV_\star(A)$ to the vectorial case, introducing the space $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$. We study the main properties of $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$ and prove a lower semicontinuity result useful for minimisation purposes. With the Direct Method in mind, we adapt the arguments of [17] to show that minimising sequences in $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$ can be modified to obtain a minimising sequence converging $\mathcal{L}^d$-a.e in $A$.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness and maximal regularity for parabolic Cauchy problems on weighted tent spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness in weighted tent spaces of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem $\partial_t u - \mathrm{div} A \nabla u = f, u(0)=0$, where the source $f$ also lies in (different) weighted tent spaces, provided the complex coefficient matrix $A$ is bounded, measurable, time-independent, and uniformly elliptic. To achieve this, we extend the theory of singular integral operators on tent spaces via off-diagonal estimates introduced by [arXiv:1112.4292] to obtain estimates on solutions $u$, and also $\nabla u$, $\partial_t u$, and $\mathrm{div} A \nabla u$ in weighted tent spaces, showing at the same time maximal regularity. Uniqueness follows from a different strategy using interior representation for weak solutions and boundary behavior.</description>

      <title>On Strong Zero-Dispersion Asymptotics for Benjamin-Ono Soliton Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soliton ensemble is a particular kind of approximation of the solution of an initial-value problem for an integrable equation by a reflectionless potential that is well adapted to singular asymptotics like the small-dispersion limit. We study soliton ensembles for the Benjamin-Ono equation by using reasonable hypotheses to develop local approximations that capture highly oscillatory features of the solution and hence provide more information than weak convergence results that are easier to obtain. These local approximations are deduced independently from empirically-observed but unproven distributions of eigenvalues of two related matrices, one Hermitian and another non-Hermitian. We perform careful numerical experiments to study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of these matrices in the small-dispersion limit, and formulate conjectures reflecting our observations. Then we apply the conjectures to construct the local approximations of slowly varying profiles and rapidly oscillating profiles as well. We show that the latter profiles are consistent with the predictions of Whitham modulation theory as originally developed for the Benjamin-Ono equation by Dobrokhotov and Krichever.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by manifold-constrained homogenization problems, we construct an extension operator for Sobolev functions defined on a perforated domain and taking values in a compact, connected $C^2$-manifold without boundary. The proof combines a by now classical extension result for the unconstrained case with a retraction argument that heavily relies on the topological properties of the manifold. With the ultimate goal of providing necessary conditions for the existence of suitable extension operators for Sobolev maps between manifolds, we additionally investigate the relationship between this problem and the surjectivity of the trace operator for such functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions $(\underline u,\lambda_{\underline u})\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R}$ to \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = f(u) \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \] with $N \ge 3$ and prescribed $L^2$ norm, and the dynamics of the solutions to \[ \begin{cases} \mathrm{i} \partial_t \Psi + \Delta \Psi = f(\Psi)\\ \Psi(\cdot,0) = \psi_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{C}) \end{cases} \] with $\psi_0$ close to $\underline u$. Here, the nonlinear term $f$ has mass-subcritical growth at the origin, mass-supercritical growth at infinity, and is more general than the sum of two powers. Under different assumptions, we prove the existence of a locally least-energy solution, the orbital stability of all such solutions, the existence of a second solution with higher energy, and the strong instability of such a solution.</description>

Abstract: We study composite assemblages of dielectrics and metamaterials with respectively positive and negative material parameters. In the continuum case, for a scalar equation, such media may exhibit so-called plasmonic resonances for certain values of the (negative) conductivity in the metamaterial. This work investigates such resonances, and the associated eigenfunctions, in the case of composite conducting networks. Unlike the continuous media, we show a surprising specific dependence on the geometry of the network of the resonant values. We also study how the problem is affected by the choice of boundary conditions on the external nodes of the structure.</description>

      <title>Weak Solution to KWC Systems of Pseudo-Parabolic Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of systems of pseudo-parabolic PDEs is considered. These systems (S)$_\varepsilon$ are derived as a pseudo-parabolic dissipation system of Kobayashi--Warren--Carter energy, proposed by [Kobayashi et al., Physica D, 140, 141--150 (2000)], to describe planar grain boundary motion. These systems have been studied in [arXiv:2402.10413], and solvability, uniqueness and strong regularity of the solution have been reported under the setting that the initial data is sufficiently smooth. Meanwhile, in this paper, we impose weaker regularity on the initial data, and work on the weak formulation of the systems. In this light, we set our goal of this paper to prove two Main Theorems, concerned with: the existence and the uniqueness of weak solution to (S)$_\varepsilon$, and the continuous dependence with respect to the index $\varepsilon$, initial data and forcings.</description>

No symmetry or Kahler assumptions on the soliton are required. The proof provides a precise asymptotic description of the singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Hegselmann--Krause model with environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time version of the Hegselmann-Krause model describing the opinion dynamics of interacting agents subject to random perturbations. Mathematically speaking, the opinion of agents is modelled by an interacting particle system with a non-Lipschitz continuous interaction force, perturbed by idiosyncratic and environmental noises. Sending the number of agents to infinity, we derive a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation as the limiting dynamic, by establishing propagation of chaos for regularized versions of the noisy opinion dynamics. To that end, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution to the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation as well as well-posedness of the associated non-local, non-linear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness by Kraichnan noise for 2D Euler equations with unbounded vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the 2D Euler equations on $\R^2$ in vorticity form, with unbounded initial vorticity, perturbed by a suitable non-smooth Kraichnan transport noise, with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1)$.
  We show weak existence for every $\dot{H}^{-1}$ initial vorticity. Thanks to the noise, the solutions that we construct are limits in law of a regularized stochastic Euler equation and enjoy an additional $L^2([0,T];H^{-\alpha})$ regularity.
  For every $p&gt;3/2$ and for certain regularity indices $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$ of the Kraichnan noise, we show also pathwise uniqueness for every $L^p$ initial vorticity. This result is not known without noise.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating semilinear partial integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider PIDEs with gradient-independent Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities and prove that deep neural networks with ReLU activation function can approximate solutions of such semilinear PIDEs without curse of dimensionality in the sense that the required number of parameters in the deep neural networks increases at most polynomially in both the dimension $ d $ of the corresponding PIDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon $.</description>

      <title>On weak inverse mean curvature flow and Minkowski-type inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a proper weak solution $\{ \Omega_{t} \}_{0 \leq t &lt; \infty}$ to inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3\leq n \leq 7$, is smooth and star-shaped by the time
  \begin{equation*}
  T= (n-1) \log \left( \frac{\text{sinh} \left( r_{+} \right)}{ \text{sinh} \left( r_{-} \right)} \right), \end{equation*} where $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$ are the geodesic out-radius and in-radius of the initial domain $\Omega_{0}$. The argument is inspired by the Alexandrov reflection method for extrinsic curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ due to Chow-Gulliver and uses a result of Li-Wei. In addition to this, our methods establish expanding spheres as the only proper weak IMCF on $\mathbb{H}^{n} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ in all dimensions.
  As applications, we extend the Minkowski inequalities of Brendle-Hung-Wang and De Lima-Girao to outer-minimizing domains $\Omega_{0} \subset \mathbb{H}^{n}$ in dimensions $3 \leq n \leq 7$. From this, we also extend a Penrose-type inequality to balanced asymptotically hyperbolic graphs over the exteriors of outer-minimizing domains of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ in these dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stability of extremal domains for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the second variation of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue on extremal domains in general Riemannian manifolds and establish a criterion for stability. We classify the stable extremal domains in the 2-sphere and higher-dimensional spheres when the boundary is minimal. Additionally, we establish topological bounds for stable domains in a general compact Riemannian surface, assuming either nonnegative total Gaussian curvature or small volume.</description>
