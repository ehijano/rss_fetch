      <title>ScanMove: Motion Prediction and Transfer for Unregistered Body Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.</description>

      <title>ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.</description>

      <title>CrossTL: A Universal Programming Language Translator with Unified Intermediate Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo, with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains, achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends. The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort, requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere development.</description>

      <title>Is this chart lying to me? Automating the detection of misleading visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the accompanying code.</description>

      <title>MicroLabVR: Interactive 3D Visualization of Simulated Spatiotemporal Microbiome Data in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.</description>

      <title>Bringing Attention to CAD: Boundary Representation Learning via Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep learning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into Bezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</description>
