      <title>Rapidly varying ionization features in a Quasi-periodic Eruption: a homologous expansion model for the spectroscopic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are recurring bursts of soft X-ray emission from supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which a growing class of models explains via extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). QPEs exhibit blackbody-like emission with significant temperature evolution, but the minimal information content of their almost pure-thermal spectra has limited physical constraints. Here we study the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (``Ansky''), which show absorption-like features evolving dramatically within eruptions and correlating strongly with continuum temperature and luminosity, further probing the conditions underlying the emission surface. The absorption features are well-described by dense ionized plasma of column density $N_{\rm H}\gtrsim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, blueshift $0.06\lesssim v/c \lesssim 0.4$, and either collisional or photoionization equilibrium. With high-resolution spectra, we also detect ionized blueshifted emission lines suggesting a nitrogen over-abundance of $21.7^{+18.5}_{-11.0}\times$ solar. We interpret our results with orbiter-disk collisions in an EMRI system, in which each impact drives a shock that locally heats the disk and expels X-ray emitting debris undergoing radiation pressure-driven homologous expansion. We explore an analytical toy model that links the rapid change in absorption lines to the evolution of the ionization parameter and the photosphere radius, and suggest that $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ ejected per eruption with expansion velocities up to $v_{\rm max}\sim 0.15c$, can reproduce the absorption features. With these assumptions, we show a P Cygni profile in a spherical expansion geometry qualitatively matches the observed line profiles. Our work takes a first step towards extending existing physical models for QPEs to address their implications for spectral line formation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of extreme Quasi-Periodic Eruptions in a newly accreting massive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 years, suggesting the activation of a $\sim$10$^6\;M_\odot$ black hole. From February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme $\sim$4.5-day QPEs with the highest fluxes and amplitudes, longest time scales, largest integrated energies, and a $\sim$25-day super-period. Low-significance UV variations are reported for the first time in a QPE host, likely related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting they are not linked solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.</description>

      <title>Sco X-1 as seen by IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray polarization of Sco X-1 was measured for the first time with very high significance by the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree of 1.0% $\pm$ 0.2% at a PA of 8{\deg} $\pm$ 6{\deg} at 90% confidence level (CL) in the 2-8 keV energy band is obtained, while the source was in its soft state with short flaring periods. The source state was determined by a strictly simultaneous X-ray observation campaign jointly with IXPE, which involved NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT, allowing for a broad-band spectrum characterization and study of quasiperiodic oscillations. The spectropolarimetric analysis yielded a polarization of &lt;3.2% for the accretion disk and a polarization of 1.3% $\pm$ 0.4% for the hard Comptonized component. A constraint on the polarization of the reflection component, modeled using relxillNS, is obtained. All the results about the polarization degree match the theoretical expectations, while the polarization angle of 8{\deg} +/- 6{\deg} at 90% CL shows a rotation of 46{\deg} $\pm$ 9{\deg} with respect to the measured position angle of the radio jet and previous marginal results by PolarLight. This may suggest a variation in the polarization angle related to the source state, which is linked to the variation of corona geometry as reported by IXPE observations of Z sources, or possibly to relativistic precession.</description>

      <title>The Moon as a Cosmic-Ray Spectrometer: Prospects for MeV Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon is the closest celestial gamma-ray emitting object. Its gamma-ray emission arises from interactions between Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and the lunar surface. While the lunar GeV gamma-ray spectrum is dominated by a continuum from hadronic decay processes, the MeV emission exhibits both continuum and distinctive spectral lines from nuclear de-excitation and radioactive decay processes. Using Geant4 Monte Carlo particle simulations, we model the lunar gamma-ray spectrum. Our results demonstrate its consistency with Fermi-LAT observations, and predict that next-generation MeV gamma-ray instruments will detect both the lunar MeV continuum and several key spectral line features, notably the $1.779~\mathrm{MeV}$ line from $\mathrm{^{28}Si}$ de-excitation enhanced by the lunar surface composition, the $e^+e^-$ annihilation line, and radioactive decay lines from $\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ ($\tau\approx3.75\,\mathrm{yr}$) and long-lived $\mathrm{^{26}Al}$ ($\tau\approx1\,\mathrm{Myr}$). These gamma-ray lines are sensitive to CRs with energies $\lesssim1\,\mathrm{GeV\,nuc^{-1}}$, offering unique temporal probes of CR activity over different timescales. Observations of the lunar MeV gamma-ray spectrum will therefore open a new window to study the current irradiation of the solar-terrestrial environment by low-energy CRs and its long-term temporal evolution.</description>

      <title>Optical flares due to X-ray irradiation during BeXRB major outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) may show strong X-ray and optical variability, and can exhibit some of the brightest outbursts that break through the Eddington limit. Major X-ray outbursts are often accompanied by strong optical flares that evolve parallel to the X-ray outburst. Our goal is to provide a simple quantitative explanation for the optical flares with an application to a sample of the brightest outbursts of BeXRBs in the Magellanic clouds and the Galactic Ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124. We constructed a numerical model to study X-ray irradiation in a BeXRB system. We then conducted a parametric investigation of the model parameters and made predictions for the intensity of the optical flares based on geometric and energetic constraints. From our modeling we found that the optical emission during major outbursts is consistent with being the result of X-ray irradiation of the Be disk. For individual systems, if this method is combined with independent constraints of the geometry of the Be disk, the binary orbital plane, and the plane of the observer, it can provide estimates of the Be disk size during major outbursts. Moreover, we computed a semi-analytical relation between optical flare luminosity and X-ray luminosity that is consistent with both model predictions and observed properties of flares.</description>

      <title>Be X-ray binary pulsar SXP 138: non-linear spin-down, pulse and spectral characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the timing and spectral properties of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar SXP 138 using four NuSTAR observations spanning 2016 to 2017. Analysis of the light curves using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram shows an increase in the spin period of SXP 138 from 140.69 to 140.85 seconds, indicating that the source is in the propeller regime. We calculate the associated rate of spin period change and characterize its non-linearity with a quadratic fit. Pulse profiles obtained by folding the light curves at the spin period show two primary high peaks and two secondary peaks for all the observations. Such features in the pulse profile can result from the combined effect of pencil and fan beam emissions from the two antipodal hotspots accompanied by the relativistic bending of photons. The energy spectra fit with both the blackbody and the power-law spectral model. The best-fit models of all observations show an overall increasing trend in the temperature of the source from 1.8 keV to 2.5 keV, during the first three observations, and a possible decreasing trend in the photon index from 1.8 to 1.7. The power-law component is dominant in the later observations, which is associated with an increase in Compton scattering and the accretion rate. SXP 138 has not been studied in detail, and this work bridges the gap by providing the first comprehensive timing and spectral analysis of this source. These findings improve our understanding of its accretion processes and emission mechanisms, placing SXP 138 in the broader context of Be/X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts from 4U 1820-30 with NICER: Accretion Disk Interactions and a Candidate Burst Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from timing and spectral studies of 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820-30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its five years of observations between 2017-2022. All bursts showed clear signs of photospheric radius expansion, where the neutron star (NS) photosphere expanded more than 50 km above the surface. One of the bursts produced a super-expansion with a blackbody emission radius of 902 km for the first time with NICER. We searched for burst oscillations in all 15 bursts and found evidence of a coherent oscillation at 716 Hz in a burst, with a 2.9$\sigma$ detection level based on Monte Carlo simulations. If confirmed with future observations, 4U 1820-30 would become the fastest-spinning NS known in X-ray binary systems. The fractional rms amplitude of the candidate burst oscillation was found to be 5.8% in the energy range of 3-10 keV. Following the variable persistent model from burst time-resolved spectroscopy, an anti-correlation is seen between the maximum scaling factor value and the (pre-burst) persistent flux. We detected a low value of ionization at the peak of each burst based on reflection modeling of burst spectra. A partially interacting inner accretion disk or a weakly ionized outer disk may cause the observed ionization dip during the photospheric radius expansion phase.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Spectral Features Observed during Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts and in the Aftermath Emission of a Long Burst from 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820--30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We find evidence of a narrow emission line at 1.0 keV and three absorption lines at 1.7, 3.0, and 3.75 keV, primarily around the photospheric radius expansion phase of most bursts. The 1.0 keV emission line remains constant, while the absorption features, attributed to wind-ejected species, are stable but show slight energy shifts, likely due to combined effects of Doppler and gravitational redshifts. We also examine with NICER the ``aftermath'' of a long X-ray burst (a candidate superburst observed by MAXI) on 2021 August 23 and 24. The aftermath emission recovers within half a day from a flux depression. During this recovery phase, we detect two emission lines at 0.7 and 1 keV, along with three absorption lines whose energies decreased to 1.57, 2.64, and 3.64 keV. Given the nature of the helium white-dwarf companion, these absorption lines during the aftermath may originate from an accretion flow, but only if the accretion environment is significantly contaminated by nuclear ashes from the superburst. This provides evidence of temporary metal enhancement in the accreted material due to strong wind loss. Moreover, we suggest that the absorption features observed during the short X-ray bursts and in the superburst aftermath share a common origin in heavy nuclear ashes enriched with elements like Si, Ar, Ca, or Ti, either from the burst wind or from an accretion flow contaminated by the burst wind.</description>

      <title>Polarization Angle Orthogonal Jumps in Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps over millisecond timescale were discovered from three bursts of a repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20201124A by the FAST telescope. We investigate the physical implications of this phenomenon. In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two electromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of the two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when linear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the total polarization degree conserved. However, incoherent superposition can lead to depolarization. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent superposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be comparable when jumps occur, placing constraints on the intrinsic radiation mechanisms. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation mechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps by generating two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a geometric effect due to sweeping line-of-sight is a more plausible reason. This requires the emission region to be within the magnetosphere of a spinning central engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes may be produced by intrinsic radiation mechanisms or Alfv\'en-O-mode transition. Plasma birefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving relativistically. Curvature radiation predicts $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|\gtrsim1$, and is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can achieve the transition amplitude ratio $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|=1$ to allow jumps to occur under special geometric configurations.</description>

      <title>A search for periodic activity in multi-peaked long gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sizeable fraction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) features a sequence of peaks, which holds information on the unknown way energy is dissipated into gamma-rays over time. Traditional searches for periodic signals in GRB LCs turned out to be inconclusive, partly because they are challenging as a consequence of the short-lived, coloured-noise, and non-stationary nature of the LCs themselves. Yet, recent claims have revived the issue. We searched for periodic components in GRB LCs through a new approach to GRBs, which escapes most of the issues faced by traditional techniques. We identified peaks through a well tested algorithm and selected GRBs with at least 10 peaks out of 5 GRB catalogues (Swift/BAT, CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM, Insight-HXMT, BeppoSAX/GRBM). Each GRB was simply treated as a discrete point process, whose realisation coincides with the sequence of peak times. We searched for possible periodic recurrences based on the multinomial distribution, after accounting for the clustering of peaks due to the non-stationarity of the GRB signals. The best candidate has a p-value of 3e-4 that there is no periodic recurrence. However, accounting for the multiple trials of 555 searched GRBs, its statistical significance is demoted to 17%. The overall distribution of the p-values obtained for all GRBs is compatible with a uniform distribution in [0,1]. We found no robust evidence for multi-peaked GRBs with periodic recurrences. We can exclude that a sizeable fraction (&gt;~ 0.75) of peaks of each GRB with at least 10 peaks are periodic. While our result does not necessarily clash with claimed periodicities based on Fourier techniques, it constrains the putative recurrent behaviour, which would not manifest itself through the sequence of peaks, but, evidently, in a more elusive way.</description>

      <title>What causes long outbursts of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) with short orbital periods (~hours) cycle between outburst and quiescent phases, and thus provide an excellent way to study the accretion process. The cause of such outbursts is believed to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some of these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO 0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a quiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such long outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other mechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically compare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For this, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period (hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion rate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst sources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces involving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways. This implies that the thermal-viscous instability in the disc cannot explain the long outbursts, but could explain the short ones. Moreover, we discuss that both donor star related and disc related models have difficulties in explaining long outbursts. Our finding will be crucial to understanding the accretion process of transiently accreting neutron stars and black holes.</description>

However, two GW events, GW190814 and GW200210, the mass of one companion object falls into the mass region of $(2.2-3)\rm~M_\odot$, and how to identify such object (e.g., as a low-mass black hole (BH) or a massive neutron star (NS)) remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the mystery compact object (MCO) with the mass region of $(2.2-3)\rm~M_\odot$ in a binary system via the possible electromagnetic (EM) radiations before and after the mergers. A multi-band EM emission can be produced with $L\propto(-t)^{7/4}$ (or $L\propto(-t)^{-5/4}$) during the inspiral phase due to the BH battery (or interaction magnetospheres) mechanism, and a bright (or dark) kilonova emission is powered by radioactive decay with ejecta mass ratio $q&gt;1.7$ (or $q&lt;1.7$) during the post-merge state when MCO is as a low-mass BH (or massive NS) to merger with NS. Moreover, by considering the merger system between MCO and a BH when MCO is a massive NS, we find that it requires the BH with high spin (e.g., $a\sim0.8-0.99$) to make sure the tidal disruption event (TDE) occurred, and a multi-band precursor emission and bright kilonova emission can also be produced during the inspiral phase and post-merge state, respectively. In any case, no matter which mechanism we adopt, such precursor emissions are too weak to be detected by most current telescopes unless the distance is close enough.</description>

      <title>Millimeter emission from supermassive black hole coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The accretion can lead to the formation of a hot, X-ray emitting corona close to the SMBH capable of accelerating relativistic electrons. Observations in the millimetre (mm) band can probe its synchrotron emission. We provide a framework to derive physical information of SMBH coronae by modelling their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to far infrared frequencies. We also explore the possibilities of deriving additional information from mm observations, such as the SMBH mass, and studying high-redshift lensed sources. We introduce a corona emission model based on a one-zone spherical region with a hybrid thermal and non-thermal plasma. We investigate in detail how the corona SED depends on different parameters such as size, opacity, and magnetic field strength. Other galactic emission components from dust, ionised gas and diffuse relativistic electrons are also included in the SED fitting scheme. We apply our code consistently to a sample of radio-quiet AGN with strong indications of a coronal component in the mm. The detected mm emission from SMBH coronae is consistent with having a non-thermal relativistic particle population with an energy density that is ~0.5-10% of that in the thermal plasma. This requires magnetic energy densities close to equipartition with the thermal gas, and corona sizes of 60-250 gravitational radii. The model can also reproduce the observed correlation between mm emission and SMBH mass when accounting for uncertainties in the corona size. The mm band offers a unique window into the physics of SMBH coronae, enabling the study of highly dust-obscured sources and high-redshift lensed quasars. Gaining a deeper understanding of the relativistic particle population in SMBH coronae can provide key insights into their potential multiwavelength and neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Sculpting the outer edge of accretion disks in pre-circumbinary binary black hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems (BBHs) have become a vivid reality in astrophysics as stellar-mass black hole mergers are now detected through their related gravitational wave emission during the merger stage. If many studies were recently dedicated to the last stages of BBH where black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk (CBD), the structure of these systems prior to the formation of the CBD remains mostly unexplored. The aim of the present article is to investigate the potential modifications induced by the presence of a secondary black hole onto the structure of the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole. We performed 2D classical hydrodynamical simulations of an accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole while taking into account all gravitational effects induced by both the primary black hole and the secondary black hole orbiting on circular orbits around the center of mass of the system.We report three main effects of the presence of a secondary black hole orbiting a circular orbit beyond the outer edge of the accretion disk: 1/ the outer radius of the accretion disk is significantly reduced and its ratio to the black hole separation is directly linked to only the mass ratio of the black holes; 2/ two spiral arms are visible in the gas density structure of the disk and 3/ the outer edge of the accretion disk exhibits an elliptical shape that mainly depends on the mass ratio of the black holes. Our results show that an accretion disk orbiting a primary black hole in a pre-CBD BBH exhibits specific features induced by the gravitational force generated by the presence of a secondary black hole beyond its outer edge. Such features, directly linked to the binary separation and mass ratio, has therefore the potential to help in the search and identification of BBH in the pre-CBD stage.</description>

      <title>Orbit design for mitigating interstellar scattering effects in Earth-space VLBI observations of Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) The black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for next-generation Earth-space very-long-baseline interferometry missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which aims to probe baselines of the order of 20 G$\lambda$. At these baselines, Sgr A* observations will be affected by the diffractive scattering effects from the interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, we study how different parameter choices for turbulence in the ISM affect BHEX's observational capabilities to probe strong lensing features of Sgr A*. By using a simple geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings for Sgr A*'s photon ring signal and observing at 320 GHz, we find that the BHEX-ALMA baseline has the required sensitivity to observe Sgr A* for a broad range of values of the power-law index of density fluctuations in the ISM and the inner scale of turbulence. For other baselines with moderate sensitivities, a strong need for observations at shorter scales of $\approx$ 13.5 G$\lambda$ is identified. For this purpose, an orbit migration scheme is proposed. It is modeled using both chemical propulsion (CP)-based Hohmann transfers and electric propulsion (EP)-based orbit raising with the result that a CP-based transfer can be performed in a matter of hours, but with a significantly higher fuel requirement as compared to EP, which however requires a transfer time of around 6 weeks. The consequences of these orbits for probing Sgr A*'s spacetime is studied by quantifying the spatial resolution, temporal resolution and the angular sampling of the photon ring signal in the Fourier coverage of each of these orbits. We show that higher orbits isolate spacetime features while sacrificing both, signal lost to scattering and temporal resolution, but gain greater access to the morphology of the photon ring.</description>

      <title>Scanning the Universe for Large-Scale Structures using Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past few decades, large universal structures have been found that challenge the homogeneity and isotropy expected in standard cosmological models. The largest of these, identified as the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, was found in 2014 in the northern galactic hemisphere in the redshift range of 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.1. Subsequent studies used an increasing gamma-ray burst database to show that the cluster was unlikely to have been caused by statistical sampling uncertainties. This study re-examines burst clustering in the northern galactic hemisphere using a recently developed methodology. Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought, with members potentially spanning the redshift range of 0.33 &lt; z &lt; 2.43. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases.</description>

      <title>A Robust Determination of Antinuclei Production from Dark Matter via Weakly Decaying Beauty Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) Collaboration presented tentative evidence for the detection of cosmic antihelion-3 (${}^3\overline{\rm He}$) events, alongside a comparable number of antideuterons ($\overline{\rm D}$). If confirmed, these observations could revolutionize our understanding of cosmic-ray production and propagation and/or serve as compelling indirect evidence for dark matter. Given that the detection of cosmic $\overline{\rm D}$ is already at the limit of AMS-02 sensitivity, explaining the observation of ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ even within the standard coalescence framework poses a significant challenge. It has recently been shown that a previously overlooked mechanism within the Standard Model of particle physics-namely, the production of antihelion via the displaced-vertex decay of $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ baryons-could substantially enhance the ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ flux arising from dark matter-induced processes. In light of these challenges, we present a tuning of Pythia that is consistent with LEP data on the fragmentation function of $b$ quarks into $b$-hadrons-a critical factor for determining the $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ multiplicity-and with ALICE and ALEPH data for the $\overline{\rm D}$ and ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ spectra, which we employ to determine our coalescence model. Our refined Pythia tuning, in conjunction with our coalescence model, results in a predicted branching ratio for the production of ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ from $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ decays that is consistent with the recent upper limit measured by LHCb. Furthermore, our prediction indicates that the contribution of $\overline{\rm D}$ and ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ from beauty-hadron decays is negligible relative to the direct production from hadronization.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>ASKAP Discoveries of Giant Radio Galaxies in the Sculptor field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 15 well-resolved giant radio galaxies (GRGs) with angular sizes &gt;5 arcmin and physical sizes &gt;1 Mpc in wide-field Phased Array Feed 944 MHz observations on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We identify their host galaxies, examine their radio properties as well as their environment, and classify their morphologies as FR I (4), FR II (8), intermediate FR I/II (2), and hybrid (1). The combined ~40 deg^2 ASKAP image of the Sculptor field, which is centred near the starburst galaxy NGC 253, has a resolution of 13" and an rms sensitivity of &gt;10 microJy/beam. The largest GRGs in our sample are ASKAP J0057-2428 (zphot = 0.238), ASKAP J0059-2352 (zphot = 0.735) and ASKAP J0107-2347 (zphot = 0.312), for which we estimate linear projected sizes of 2.7, 3.5 and 3.8 Mpc, respectively. In total we catalog 232 extended radio galaxies of which 77 (33%) are larger than 0.7 Mpc and 35 (15%) are larger than 1 Mpc. The radio galaxy densities are 5.8 deg^-2 (total) and 0.9 (1.9) deg^-2 for those larger than 1 (0.7) Mpc, similar to previous results. Furthermore, we present the ASKAP discovery of a head-tail radio galaxy, a double-lobe radio galaxy with a spiral host, and radio emission from several galaxy clusters. As the ASKAP observations were originally conducted to search for a radio counterpart to the gravitational wave detection GW190814 (z ~ 0.05), we highlight possible host galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Parameter extraction of the stochastic gravitational wave background with peak-like templates in millihertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a framework for extracting parameters of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with peak-like templates in the millihertz frequency band, and analyzing transient contamination effects on parameter reconstruction. We present the spectrum and spectrogram under different conditions and provide the results of parameter reconstruction. Using templates from the early universe, we demonstrate that the peak-like templates outperform the broken power law (BPL) templates in power-law exponents recovery and peak frequency localization. The reconstruction results obtained using data from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are better than those obtained using data from Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which is based on the spectrogram. For the single-peak template, the estimation accuracy of the exponent and peak frequency surpasses that of the BPL template by an order of magnitude, but demonstrates less precision in amplitude estimation compared to BPL. Regarding the double-peak template, parameter estimation results derived from the FFT methodology consistently outperform those obtained using STFT. Nevertheless, transient signals exhibit a detrimental impact on parameter estimation precision, causing errors to increase by an order of magnitude, particularly in multi-peak scenarios. This framework provides an example for using templates to analyze data from space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the (frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests that dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We derive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory methods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the renormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More generally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts of gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole moments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular case of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the role of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron stars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit of axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Baryon asymmetry constraints on magnetic field from the Electroweak epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay of helical (hyper)magnetic fields that may have been present in the Universe during the Electroweak epoch can contribute to generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We revise constraints on the strength and correlation length of such fields from the requirement that their decay does not lead to over-production of the baryon asymmetry. We show that the helical fields with strength down to 1e-5 of the maximal possible strength during the Electroweak epoch should have had their correlation at least ~1e-6 of the Hubble radius during this epoch. For weaker fields this lower bound on the correlation length relaxes proportionally to the square of magnetic field strength. A field with parameters saturating the bound may actually be responsible for the baryon asymmetry observed today. We show that relic of such a field, surviving in the present day Universe in the form of intergalactic magnetic field detectable with Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, may have the strength up to 10-100 pG and can have parameters needed to affect the cosmological recombination and relax the Hubble tension. We also show that there is no constraint on the parameters of helical or non-helical magnetic fields stemming from the requirement that the baryon isocurvature perturbations produced by such fields during the Electroweak epoch are within the observational limits.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals with general dynamical friction in dark matter minispikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. Our calculation show that these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, therefore the evolution of the eccentricity depends on the competition between the fast moving DM particles and the slow moving DM particles. The results show that the dynamical friction enhances the eccentricity when $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}\lesssim2.0$, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the characteristic strain is suppressed at lower frequencies, and the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using this analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Millihertz Quasiperiodic Oscillations in GS 1826-238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a systematic investigation of millihertz quasiperiodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) in the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826$-$238 observed with {\it NICER} and {\it Insight}-HXMT. We discovered 37 time intervals exhibiting mHz QPOs out of 106 Good Time Interval (GTI) samples in the frequency range of 3$-$17 mHz at a significance level of $&gt;99.99\%$. The source remains in a soft state in our study. No significant differences are found between the samples with and without mHz QPOs according to positions in the color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams. These QPOs were discovered at an accretion rate of $\sim 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, similar to other sources. The broadband spectrum of GS 1826$-$238 can be modeled as a combination of a multicolor blackbody from the accretion disk and a Comptonization with seed photons emitted from the neutron star (NS) surface. The flux modulations of mHz QPOs are related to variations of the temperature of Comptonization seed photons, consistent with the marginally stable burning theory.</description>

      <title>Characterization and classification of $\gamma$-ray bursts from blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars are the most common sources of $\gamma$-ray photons in the extragalactic sky. Their $\gamma$-ray light curves are characterized by bright flaring episodes, similarly to what is observed at longer wavelengths. These gamma-ray bursts from blazars (GRBBLs) have been extensively studied individually, but never in terms of a population. The goal of this work is to provide a global characterization of GRBBLs, to investigate the parameter space of the population, and ultimately to classify GRBBLs. Their global properties could give insights into the physical mechanisms responsible for the $\gamma$-ray radiation and into the origin of the observed variability. I analyzed a sample of publicly available Fermi-LAT light curves, utilizing only blazars with certain redshift measurements. The redshift-corrected light curves were then automatically scanned to identify GRBBLs. A simple flare profile, with an exponential rise and decay, was then fit to all events. The fit parameters, together with the information on spectral variability during the events, and the global properties from the LAT catalog, were then used as inputs for unsupervised machine learning classification. The analysis shows that the GRBBL population is remarkably homogeneous. The classifier splits the population into achromatic (the large majority) and chromatic (the outliers) GRBBLs, but the transition between the two classes is smooth, with significant overlap. When the information on the spectral variability is removed, there is evidence for a classification into two classes, mainly driven by the peak luminosities. As a by-product of this study, I identify a correlation between the timescales of the GRBBLs and their peak luminosity.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>

      <title>Propagation-induced Frequency-dependent Polarization Properties of Fast Radio Burst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-dependent polarization properties provide crucial insights into the radiation mechanisms and magnetic environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore an analytical solution of radiative transfer of the polarization properties of FRBs as a strong incoming wave propagates in a homogeneous magnetized plasma. The cases of a thermal plasma is studied in detail. The rotational axis of the polarization spectrum undergoes precession with frequency on the Poincar\'e sphere when the medium has both strong Faraday rotation and conversion. Such precession on the Poincar\'e sphere could occur in hot or cold plasma with a strong magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. Significant absorption can exist in a dense plasma medium, which may give rise to a highly circularly polarized outgoing wave. We apply the analytical solution with the mixing Faraday case to fit the observations of frequency-dependent Stokes parameters for FRB 20180301A and FRB 20201124A. The analytical solution offers a more physical description of FRBs' magnetic environment properties than the empirical ``generalized Faraday rotation'' method commonly adopted in the literature. The frequency-dependent Stokes parameters may be associated with reversing rotation measures or the presence of a persistent radio source around an FRB.</description>

      <title>DW Cnc: a micronova with a negative superhump and a flickering spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables have been known to show bursts driven by different physical mechanisms; however, the burst occurrence is much rarer than in their non-magnetic counterparts. DW Cnc is a well-studied intermediate polar that showed a burst with a 4-magnitude amplitude in 2007. Here we report on a recent burst in DW Cnc observed by ASAS-SN that reached a peak luminosity of 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, another 4 mag increase from its quiescent high state level. The released energy of the burst suggests that these are micronovae, a distinctive type of burst seen in magnetic systems that may be caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the confined accretion flow. Only a handful of systems, most of them intermediate polars, have a reported micronova bursts. We also report on the reappearance of the negative superhump of DW~Cnc as shown by TESS and OPTICAM data after the system emerges from its low state and immediately before the burst. We further report on a new phenomenon, where the spin signal turns "on" and "off" on the precession period associated with the negative superhump, which may indicate pole flipping. The new classification of DW Cnc as a micronova as well as the spin variability show the importance of both monitoring known micronova systems and systematic searches for more similar bursts, to limit reliance on serendipitous discoveries.</description>

      <title>Blast waves and reverse shocks: from ultra-relativistic GRBs to moderately relativistic X-ray binaries</title>

Abstract: Blast wave models are commonly used to model relativistic outflows from ultra-relativistic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but are also applied to lower Lorentz factor ejections from X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we revisit the physics of blast waves and reverse shocks in these systems and explore the similarities and differences between the ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma \gg 1$) and moderately relativistic ($\Gamma \sim$ a few) regimes. We first demonstrate that the evolution of the blast wave radius as a function of the observer frame time is recovered in the on-axis ultra-relativistic limit from a general energy and radius blast wave evolution, emphasizing that XRB ejections are off-axis, moderately relativistic cousins of GRB afterglows. We show that, for fixed blast wave or ejecta energy, reverse shocks cross the ejecta much later (earlier) on in the evolution for less (more) relativistic systems, and find that reverse shocks are much longer-lived in XRBs and off-axis GRBs compared to on-axis GRBs. Reverse shock crossing should thus typically finish after $\sim10-100$ days (in the observer frame) in XRB ejections. This characteristic, together with their moderate Lorentz factors and resolvable core separations, makes XRB ejections unique laboratories for shock and particle acceleration physics. We discuss the impact of geometry and lateral spreading on our results, explore how to distinguish between different shock components, and comment on the implications for GRB and XRB environments. Additionally, we argue that identification of reverse shock signatures in XRBs could provide an independent constraint on the ejecta Lorentz factor.</description>

Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine two thermal models, comparing the results for constant redshifted temperature with those for uniform entropy per baryon.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Calculation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ mode frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives a notion of the composition and EoS of compact stars. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs. In this work we compute the fundamental ($f$) and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic, quark, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$). For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with other different properties. We find that various possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the oscillation frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with slope parameter of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>

Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>
