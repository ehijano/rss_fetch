Abstract: One of the most difficult topics in the subject of Discrete Mathematics is the subject of Propositional Logic, therefore the present work had as objective to facilitate the learning of Propositional Logic through the implementation of didactic material with the use of educational technology that contributes to the achievement of the objectives established in the syllabus of the subject of Discrete Mathematics, because the knowledge that it provides to Computer Engineers is essential for their professional development. The study was considered of the quasi-experimental type of descriptive cut, where a diagnostic instrument and another of satisfaction were used. The description presents both the redesign of teaching materials based on the ASSURE instructional design model and its implementation through the educational intervention process. Two groups of non-equivalent students from the Faculty of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico participated, who were selected by convenience. The results revealed that a high percentage of progress was made in completing the propositional logic topic, despite other unanticipated factors, such as the change from in-person to online instructional modality due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
