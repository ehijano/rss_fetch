      <title>A meta-model of belief dynamics with Personal, Expressed and Social beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beliefs are central to individual decision-making and societal dynamics, yet they are shaped through complex interactions between personal cognition and social environments. Traditional models of belief dynamics often fail to capture the interplay between internal belief systems and external influences. This paper introduces the Personal, Expressed, and Social Beliefs (PES) meta-model, which integrates personal beliefs, outwardly expressed beliefs, and perceptions of others' beliefs. The PES meta-model provides a flexible structure to model belief dynamics, incorporating processes like social influence, authenticity, ego projection, and conformity. It accommodates wide range of existing models, of the Voter, Ising, DeGroot and bounded confidence types, allowing for comparison and extension of the models within a unified framework. Through a case study on the misperception of public support for climate change policies, the PES meta-model demonstrates its capacity to capture complex psychological and social phenomena. This work highlights the utility of the PES meta-model in advancing theoretical understanding and practical applications in belief dynamics research.</description>

      <title>Understanding Financial Contagion: A Complexity Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews key contributions of complexity science to the study of systemic risk in financial systems. The focus is on network models of financial contagion, where I explore various mechanisms of shock propagation, such as counterparty default risk and overlapping portfolios. I highlight how the interconnectedness of financial institutions can amplify risk, and I discuss how standard risk management tools, which neglect these interactions, can increase systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Understanding infection risks of COVID-19 in the city: an investigation of infected neighborhoods in Wuhan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, built environments in dense urban settings become major sources of infection. This study tests the difference of demographics and surrounding built environments across high-, medium- and low-infection neighborhoods, to inform the high-risk areas in the city. We found that high-infection neighborhoods own a higher ratio of aged population than other neighborhoods on average. However, it shows no statistical difference in terms of population density. Additionally, high-infection neighborhoods are closer to high-risk built environments than the others. In a walking distance, they also can access more of the high-risk built environments except for the wholesale markets and shopping malls. These findings advise policy-makers to deploy social distancing measures in precision, regulating the access of high-risk facilities to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.</description>

      <title>Bibliometric Analysis of Scientific Production on the COVID-19 Effect in Information Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the scientific production on the COVID-19 effect in the area of Information Sciences from a bibliometric perspective. The objectives focused on: 1) determining the most productive authors, countries, institutions and journals; 2) identifying the sources that constitute the core of scientific production; 3) examining the manuscripts with the greatest impact; and 4) visualizing the thematic and conceptual structure of the scientific domain analyzed. Bibliometric indicators and factor analysis techniques were used for data analysis. A total of 1,175 publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection from 2020 to 2022 were retrieved. The results showed that the most relevant countries were the United States, United Kingdom, China and Spain. The core of the scientific production was formed by the publications: Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, Information Professional, Scientometrics and Journal of Health Communication. The papers with the greatest impact were concentrated in those dedicated to the analysis of the role of telemedicine in medical care. The conceptual structure showed the main research fronts, such as the role of telehealth, academic libraries and digital literacy in the fight against the pandemic, the role of social networks in the health crisis, as well as the problem of misinformation and fake news</description>

      <title>Risk-mediated dynamic regulation of effective contacts de-synchronizes outbreaks in metapopulation epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metapopulation epidemic models help capture the spatial dimension of infectious disease spread by dividing heterogeneous populations into separate but interconnected communities, represented by nodes in a network. In the event of an epidemic, an important research question is, to what degree spatial information (i.e., regional or national) is relevant for mitigation and (local) policymakers. This study investigates the impact of different levels of information on nationwide epidemic outcomes, modeling the reaction to the measured hazard as a feedback loop reducing contact rates in a metapopulation model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Using COVID-19 and high-resolution mobility data for Germany of 2020 as a case study, we found two markedly different regimes depending on the maximum contact reduction $\psi_{\rm max}$: mitigation and suppression. In the regime of (modest) mitigation, gradually increasing $\psi_{\rm max}$ from zero to moderate levels delayed and spread out the onset of infection waves while gradually reducing the peak values. This effect was more pronounced when the contribution of regional information was low relative to national data. In the suppression regime, the feedback-induced contact reduction is strong enough to extinguish local outbreaks and decrease the mean and variance of the peak day distribution, thus regional information was more important. When suppression or elimination is impossible, ensuring local epidemics are desynchronized helps to avoid hospitalization or intensive care bottlenecks by reallocating resources from less-affected areas.</description>

      <title>The illusion of households as entities in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data recording connections between people in communities and villages are collected and analyzed in various ways, most often as either networks of individuals or as networks of households. These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network -- from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data.</description>

      <title>Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Epidemic risk perception and social interactions lead to awareness cascades on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The course of an epidemic is not only shaped by infection transmission over face-to-face contacts, but also by preventive behaviour caused by risk perception and social interactions. This study explores the dynamics of coupled awareness and biological infection spread within a two-layer multiplex network framework. One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge. Under these conditions, the combination of a small-world face-to-face and a scale-free social layer, but not vice versa, make that the extent of the infections decreases with increasing transmission probability.</description>
