Abstract: We discover a general stringy scaling behavior for 1. All n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) and 2. A class of n-point Regge string scattering amplitudes (RSSA) to all string loop orders. The number of independent kinematics variables is found to be reduced by dim M.</description>

      <title>Toward stringy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a first step towards developing a new language to describe causal structure, event horizons, and quantum extremal surfaces (QES) for the bulk description of holographic systems beyond the standard Einstein gravity regime. By considering the structure of boundary operator algebras, we introduce a stringy ``causal depth parameter'', which quantifies the depth of the emergent radial direction in the bulk, and a certain notion of ergodicity on the boundary. We define stringy event horizons in terms of the half-sided inclusion property, which is related to a stronger notion of boundary ergodic or quantum chaotic behavior. Using our definition, we argue that above the Hawking--Page temperature, there is an emergent sharp horizon structure in the large $N$ limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang--Mills at finite nonzero 't Hooft coupling. In contrast, some previously considered toy models of black hole information loss do not have a stringy horizon. Our methods can also be used to probe violations of the equivalence principle for the bulk gravitational system, and to explore aspects of stringy nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Time-Ordered-Correlators for the Pure Inverted Quartic Oscillator: Classical Chaos meets Quantum Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs) have been suggested as a means to diagnose chaotic behavior in quantum mechanical systems. Recently, it was found that OTOCs display exponential growth for the inverted quantum harmonic oscillator, mirroring the fact that this system is classically and quantum mechanically unstable. In this work, I study OTOCs for the inverted anharmonic (pure quartic) oscillator in quantum mechanics, finding only oscillatory behavior despite the classically unstable nature of the system. For higher temperature, OTOCs seem to exhibit saturation consistent with a value of $-2 \langle x^2 \rangle_T \langle p^2 \rangle_T$ at late times. I provide analytic evidence from the spectral zeta-function and the WKB method as well as direct numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation that the inverted quartic oscillator possesses a real and positive energy eigenspectrum, and normalizable wave-functions.</description>

      <title>BMN-like sectors in 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM with boundaries and interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM admits half-BPS boundaries, defects and interfaces as well as compactifications to 3d $\mathcal N\,{=}\,4$ SCFTs, realized as intersections of D3, D5 and NS5 branes. We explore operators with large R-charge. We identify Penrose limits in the holographic duals with geometry $\rm AdS_4\times S^2\times S^2\times\Sigma$, which describe, for each theory, a spectrum of `seed' operators which each give rise to a BMN-like sector described by a pp-wave. We relate the number of BMN-like sectors to the flavor symmetry of the CFT. For a sample of theories including the Janus interface, D3/D5 BCFTs and BCFTs with 3d SCFTs on the boundary, we determine the spectra of nearby operators and discuss the field theory realization of the seed operators. We further identify families of Penrose limits which give rise to more general pp-wave sectors.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for $\mathcal{N}=2$ BPS structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose generating functions which encode the degeneracies and wall-crossing phenomena of $\mathcal{N}=2$ BPS structures. The generating functions have a representation-theoretic origin and are the analogs of the 1/4-BPS dyon counting formula in $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories involving the Weyl denominator formula of a Borcherds-Kac-Moody Lie algebra. A general form of the generating function is suggested based on the Lie algebra associated to the adjacency matrix of the BPS quiver whenever the BPS spectrum of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory admits such a description. This proposal is tested for the BPS spectrum of Seiberg-Witten SU(2) theory as well as for the $D6$-$D2$-$D0$ BPS structure of the resolved conifold which are both captured by an affine $A_1$ Lie algebra and are obtained from limits of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ generating function. The general proposal also reproduces the correct BPS spectra and wall-crossing structures for the Argyres-Douglas $A_2$ theory. We further discuss connections to scattering diagrams studied in the context of stability structures.</description>

      <title>AdS$_{3}$ spacetime genus fluctuations and their influence on the false vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the genus fluctuations of the AdS$_{3}$ spacetime. The tunneling action of the high genus AdS$_{3}$ spacetime is formulated in the Siegel upper half space. Adopting the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we computed the genus creation rate in the semiclassical region. We show that a genus is more easily created in the spacetime corresponding to a larger absolute value of the cosmological constant. We find that fluctuations of fat wormholes are more likely to occur than those of thin wormholes. We also studied the influence of genus fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum decay rate will increase if the effect of genus fluctuations is included. We show that all results do not change qualitatively when the values of certain parameters are changed.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>A free field approach to $\widehat{g}_{k}$ and parafermionic $\widehat{g}_{k}/\widehat{u(1)}^{r}$ Ishibashi states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, I proposed a method to challenge the calculations of genus-$g$, bulk $n$-point, $b$-boundary, $c$-crosscap functions with $x$ boundary operators $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$) by expanding them as infinite linear combinations of genus-$g$, $(n+b+c)$-point bulk correlation functions. Applying free field resolutions of irreducible chiral modules is an effective method for obtaining infinite linear coefficients in the expansion. We review free field resolution conjectures of dominant irreducible $\widehat{g}_{k}$ highest-weight modules and higher-rank parafermionic $\widehat{g}_{k}/ \widehat{u(1)}^{r}$ modules, and apply them to corresponding Ishibashi states.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion in conformal field theory with W-symmetry and the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence between two-dimensional $WA_{r}$/$WD_{r}$-type conformal field theories and the higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) obtained from the affine Toda field theories associated with $A_r^{(1)}/D_r^{(1)}$-type affine Lie algebras. We calculate the period integrals of the WKB solution to the ODE along the Pochhammer contour, where the WKB expansions correspond to the classical conserved currents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. We also compute the integrals of motion for $WA_{r}$($WD_{r}$) algebras on a cylinder. Their eigenvalues on the vacuum state are confirmed to agree with the period integrals up to the sixth order. These results generalize the ODE/IM correspondence to higher-order ODEs and can be used to predict higher-order integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Identifying optimal large $N$ limits for marginal $\phi^4$ theory in 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply our previously developed approach to marginal quartic interactions in multiscalar QFTs, which shows that one-loop RG flows can be described in terms of a commutative algebra, to various models in 4d. We show how the algebra can be used to identify optimal scalings of the couplings for taking large $N$ limits. The algebra identifies these limits without diagrammatic or combinatorial analysis. For several models this approach leads to new limits yet to be explored at higher loop orders. We consider the bifundamental and trifundamental models, as well as a matrix-vector model with an adjoint representation. Among the suggested new limit theories are some which appear to be less complex than general planar limits but more complex than ordinary vector models or melonic models.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmology from double field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy limit of string theory contains additional gravitational degrees of freedom, a skew-symmetric tensor $B$-field and a scalar dilaton, that are not present in general relativity. Together with the metric, these three fields are naturally embedded in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric framework of double field theory. The $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry uniquely prescribes the interactions between the extended gravitational sector and other matter, leading to novel features beyond conventional string cosmology. In this work we present the equations of motion for linear perturbations around $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmological backgrounds in $D=4$ under a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We obtain analytic solutions in the superhorizon limit for scalar perturbations around various homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, including some candidate models for bouncing cosmologies. The generalized energy-momentum tensor includes source terms for the $B$-field and dilaton, and we show how the resulting generalized conservation laws modify the conditions for conservation of curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Renormalization and running in the 2D $CP(1)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the scattering amplitude in the two dimensional $CP(1)$ model in a regularization scheme independent way. When using cutoff regularization, a new Feynman rule from the path integral measure is required if one is to preserve the symmetry. The physical running of the coupling with renormalization scale arises from a UV finite Feynman integral in all schemes. We reproduce the usual result with asymptotic freedom, but the pathway to obtaining the beta function can be different in different schemes. We also comment on the way that this model evades the classic argument by Landau against asymptotic freedom in non-gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect of a doubly Lorentz-violating scalar in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work I study the Casimir effect caused by a charged and massive scalar field that violates Lorentz symmetry in an aether-like and CPT even manner, by direct coupling between the field derivatives and two fixed orthogonal unit vectors. I call this a "double" Lorentz violation. The field will satisfy either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of plane parallel plates. I use the generalized zeta function technique to examine the effect of a uniform magnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on the Casimir energy and pressure. Three different pairs of mutual directions of the unit vectors are possible: timelike and spacelike perpendicular to the magnetic field, timelike and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field, spacelike perpendicular and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field. I fully examine all of them for both types of boundary conditions listed above and, in all cases and for both types of boundary conditions, I obtain simple expressions of the zeta function, Casimir energy and pressure in the three asymptotic limits of strong magnetic field, large mass, and small plate distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the Hamiltonian reduction of Lower Spin Gravity, the simplest bulk dual for a Warped Conformal Field Theory (WCFT), consisting in an $SL(2) \times U(1)$ Chern-Simons model. We identify the boundary action as the geometric action on coadjoint orbits of the Warped Virasoro group. We use this reduced action to compute one-loop contributions to the torus partition function and compare them to the Warped Virasoro characters.</description>

      <title>The symplectic potential for leaky boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charges associated with gauge symmetries are defined on boundaries of spacetimes. But these constructions typically involve divergent quantities when considering asymptotic boundaries. Different prescriptions exist to address this problem, based on ambiguities in the definition of the symplectic potential. We propose a method well suited to leaky boundaries, which describe spacetimes than can exchange matter or radiation with their environment. The main advantage of this approach is that it relies only on the bulk Lagrangian and it is not tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions. The prescription is applied to four dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the partial Bondi gauge. This leads to a finite symplectic potential for unconstrained boundary data and reveals two new corner symplectic pairs associated with the relaxation of the gauge.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Formulation of 4d Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we construct a formulation of 4d pure Yang-Mills theory in the unfolded language of higher-spin gravity. It represents a first-order formulation possessing manifest diffeomorphism- and gauge-invariance. We make use of an unfolding method that was recently put forward and used to unfold scalar electrodynamics. We also discuss features of various unfolding maps defined by the unfolded equations.</description>

      <title>Celestial amplitudes on electromagnetic backgrounds: T-duality from S-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the boundary holographic dual of S-duality for gauge theories in asymptotically flat space-times? Celestial amplitudes, by virtue of exhibiting holographic properties of the S-matrix, appear well-suited for studying this question. We scatter electrically and magnetically charged massless scalars off non-trivial electromagnetic potentials such as shockwaves, spin-one conformal primary waves, conformally soft modes and their magnetic duals which we construct. This reveals an intricate relation between conformally soft solutions, descendant CFT three-point functions and, by means of the two-dimensional shadow transform, CFT two-point functions. By comparing celestial amplitudes on electric and magnetic dual backgrounds, we provide evidence that the four-dimensional flat-space holographic dual of S-duality in Abelian gauge theory is two-dimensional T-duality. Moreover, we demonstrate that for two-dimensional boundary actions describing low-energy sectors of the bulk gauge theory, S-duality can be explicitly implemented as a T-duality transformation. We show that the Dirac quantisation condition guarantees gauge invariance in the eikonal re-summation for scattering from potentials which for magnetic scalars can be expressed in terms of 't Hooft loops.</description>

      <title>UV Completion of Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as they are absent in the SM and are first generated by dimension-8 operators in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We study the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like heavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC vertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit. Such fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy fermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce dimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields, which are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating off-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients and in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In the heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by conventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic corrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics via nTGCs at the high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>The Kondo impurity in the large spin limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo problem, which describes the interaction of a spin $s$ magnetic impurity with a free Fermi gas, is a classic example of strongly coupled physics. Historically, the problem has been solved by Wilson's numerical renormalization group and later by Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we present an alternate analytic solution of the Kondo problem that combines an expansion in $1/s$ with the renormalization group. We study both the case of an impurity interacting with a single channel $K=1$ of fermions in the $s \rightarrow \infty$ limit and the case with $K$ channels in the double-scaling limit $K \rightarrow \infty$, $s \to \infty$, $K/s$ fixed. Our approach allows us to describe analytically intermediate scales of the Kondo problem at large $s$ and compute thermodynamic observables such as the impurity entropy and susceptibility. We find these observables to agree with the Bethe ansatz results. We also compute the impurity spectral function, finite temperature resistivity and the Kondo screening cloud profile, properties that are not easily accessible from Bethe ansatz. Notably, in the regime $K &gt; 2s$ we access the "non-Fermi-liquid" overscreened fixed point of the multichannel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Stable f(Q) gravity model through non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study effectively reconstructs a cosmological model utilizing covariant $f(Q)$ gravity within Connection-III and FLRW spacetime. The dynamic behavior of the reconstructed model is thoroughly analyzed using the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and various observational datasets. Our robust findings demonstrate that the model displays quintessence behavior at the present epoch and converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late time. It is confirmed through comprehensive evaluations against energy conditions that the Null Energy Condition remains positive throughout cosmic evolution, and the Dominant Energy Condition is consistently satisfied. The Strong Energy Condition is initially fulfilled in the early Universe but violated in the late epoch. Moreover, scalar perturbations extensively assess stability, affirming the strength of the model with respect to the Hubble parameter. This research offers compelling insights into cosmic acceleration, suggesting that $f(Q)$ gravity can effectively displace the $\Lambda$CDM model and provides a convincing alternative explanation for the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without relying on the cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike generic models of regular black holes (BHs) with nonzero surface gravity on both Cauchy and event horizons, an inner-degenerate counterpart with zero Cauchy horizon surface gravity was recently proposed. For this regular BH solution with spherical symmetry, we examine the stability of the Cauchy horizon from both classic and quantum mechanics viewpoints. We find that the classical perturbations do not lead to mass inflation at the Cauchy horizon, indicating classically stability, while quantum fluctuations cause it to be unstable quantum mechanically.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations, but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Poisson brackets at null infinity compatible with smooth superrotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superrotations are local extensions of the Lorentz group at null infinity that have been argued to be symmetries of gravitational scattering. In their smooth version, they can be identified with the group of diffeomorphisms on the celestial sphere. Their canonical realization requires treating the celestial metric as a variable in the gravitational phase space, along with the news and shear tensors. In this paper, we derive the resulting Poisson brackets (PB). The standard PB algebra of the news and shear tensors is augmented by distributional terms at the boundaries of null infinity, including novel PB relations between the celestial metric and the radiative variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1606.01267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of models of quantum gravity in d dimensional Minkowski space in terms of random tensor models, and correct some mistakes in our previous treatment of the subject. We find a large class of models in which the large impact parameter scattering scales with energy and impact parameter like Newton`s law. These same models also have emergent energy, momentum and angular conservation laws, despite being based on time dependent Hamiltonians. Many of the scattering amplitudes have a Feynman diagram like structure: local interaction vertices connected by propagation of free particles (really Sterman-Weinberg jets of particles). However, there are also amplitudes where jets collide to form large meta-stable objects, with all the scaling properties of black holes: energy, entropy and temperature, as well as the characteristic time scale for the decay of perturbations. We generalize the conjecture of Sekino and Susskind, to claim that all of these models are fast scramblers. The rationale for this claim is that the interactions are invariant under fuzzy subgroups of the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms, so that they are highly non-local on the holographic screen. We review how this formalism resolves the Firewall Paradox.</description>

Abstract: We propose a relation the expansions of regular and irregular semiclassical conformal blocks at different branch points making use of the connection between the accessory parameters of the BPZ decoupling equations to the logarithm derivative of isomonodromic tau functions. We give support for these relations by considering two eigenvalue problems for the confluent Heun equations obtained from the linearized perturbation theory of black holes. We first derive the large frequency expansion of the spheroidal equations, and then compare numerically the excited quasi-normal mode spectrum for the Schwarzschild case obtained from the large frequency expansion to the one obtained from the low frequency expansion and with the literature, indicating that the relations hold generically in the complex modulus plane.</description>

Abstract: In this lecture note, we give a basic introduction to the rapidly developing concepts of generalized symmetries, from the perspectives of both high energy physics and condensed matter physics. In particular, we emphasize on the (invertible) higher-form and higher-group symmetries. For the physical applications, we discuss the geometric engineering of QFTs in string theory and the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in condensed matter physics.
  The lecture note is based on a short course on generalized symmetries, jointly given by Yi-Nan Wang and Qing-Rui Wang in Feb. 2023, which took place at School of Physics, Peking University (https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/18796/).</description>

Abstract: We verify that the recently proven infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities are maximally tight, i.e. they are facets of the holographic entropy cone. The proof is technical but it offers some heuristic insight. On star graphs, both families of inequalities quantify how concentrated / spread information is with respect to a dihedral symmetry acting on subsystems. In addition, toric inequalities viewed in the K-basis show an interesting interplay between four-party and six-party perfect tensors.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator as a detector of baryonic phase structure in holographic QCD with instanton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) of Skyrmion as baryon in the D0-D4/D8 model which is expected to be holographically dual to QCD with instantons as D0-branes or with a non-zero theta angle. Baryon states are identified to the excitations of the Skyrmion which are described by a holographic quantum mechanical system in this model. By employing the definition of OTOC in quantum mechanics, we derive the formulas and demonstrate explicitly the numerical calculations of the OTOC. Our calculation illustrates the quantum OTOC with imaginary Lyapunov coefficient indicates the possibly metastable baryonic status in the presence of the instanton while the classical OTOC can not, thus it reveals the instantonic or theta-dependent features of QCD are dominated basically by its quantum properties. Furthermore, the OTOC also implies the baryonic phase becomes really chaotic with real Lyapunov exponent if the instanton charge increases sufficiently which agrees with the unstable baryon spectrum presented in this model. In this sense, we believe the OTOC may be treated as a tool to detect the baryonic phase structure of QCD.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric spectrum for vector multiplet on Euclidean AdS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum study of supersymmetric theories on Euclidean two dimensional anti-de Sitter space (EAdS$_2$) requires complexified spectrum. For a chiral multiplet, we showed that the spectrum of the Dirac operator acquires a universal shift of $\text{i}/2$ from the real spectrum to make the supersymmetry between boson and fermion manifest, where both the bosonic and fermionic eigenfunctions are normalizable using an appropriate definition of Euclidean inner product. We extend this analysis to the vector multiplet, where we show that the gaugino requires both $+\text{i}/2$ and $-\text{i}/2$ shift from the real spectrum, and there is additional isolated point at vanishing spectral parameter which is mapped by supersymmetry to the boundary zero modes of the vector field. Furthermore, this spectral analysis shows that not every bosonic fields in the vector multiplet can satisfy normalizable boundary condition. Nevertheless, aided by a reorganization of fields into a cohomological form, we find the supersymmetry mapping between bosons and fermions in terms of the expansion coefficients with respect to the newly constructed basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical-dS scenario in the type II string theories proposes to search for dS vacua of orientifold flux compactifications in a regime where string corrections to the compactified effective field theory are negligible. We study a minimal extension of this scenario in which the leading string corrections to the O-plane/D-brane actions at the 4-derivative order are included but higher orders as well as string corrections in the bulk are self-consistently neglected. Our proposal is motivated by a recent debate about dS solutions with O8-planes which circumvent a classical no-go theorem due to unusual sources leading to so-called permissive boundary conditions for the 10D supergravity fields. We argue that such sources do not arise in classical supergravity but ask whether including the 4-derivative corrections leads to sources that have a similar effect. However, we find that the 4-derivative corrections do not allow meta-stable dS in a class of models with O8-planes and/or D8-branes we consider. We also study related models which in addition contain O6-planes/D6-branes and find that again no meta-stable dS is allowed, both classically and including the 4-derivative corrections. While some of the arguments in this work require the backreaction of the O-plane/D-brane sources to be small, others are valid including the full backreaction.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting and Quantum Discord of Alpha Vacua in de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CPT invariant vacuum states of a scalar field in de Sitter space, called $\alpha$-vacua, are not unique. We explore the $\alpha$-vacua from the quantum information perspective by a pair of static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors coupled to a scalar field with either monopole or dipole coupling, which are in time-like zero separation or space-like antipodal separation. The analytical form of the reduced final state of the UDW detector is derived. We study the entanglement harvesting and quantum discord of the reduced state, which characterize the quantum entanglement and quantum correlation of the underlying $\alpha$-vacua, respectively. Our results imply that the quantum entanglement gravitated by de Sitter gravity behaves quite differently for time-like and space-like separations. It experiences ``sudden death" for the former and grows for the latter as the measuring time or the value of $\alpha$ increases. This demonstrates the nonlocal nature of quantum entanglement. For the quantum discord, we find no ``sudden death" behavior, and it experiences superhorizon suppression, which explains the superhorizon decoherence in the inflationary universe scenario. Overall, the time-like or space-like quantum entanglement and correlation behave differently on their dependence of $\alpha$, measuring time and spectral gaps, with details discussed in this work.</description>

Abstract: The distance conjecture states that for theories with moduli coupled to gravity a tower of states becomes light exponentially in the geodesic distance in moduli space. This specifies how effective field theories break down for large field values. However, phenomenological field theories have no moduli, but a scalar potential that deforms dynamical trajectories away from geodesic curves. In this note we speculate on how one should generalise the distance conjecture, in asymptotic field regimes, to include a scalar potential. We test the generalised distance conjecture in a few cases, demonstrate a link with pseudo-/fake supersymmetry and apply it to the ekpyrotic scenario in cosmology. For the latter we observe that the pre-uplift KKLT potential could provide a stringy embedding of ekpyrosis away from the asymptotic regimes in field space.</description>

Abstract: Study of correlation functions in AdS/CFT and in-in correlators in de Sitter space often requires the computation of Witten diagrams. Due to the complexity of evaluating radial integrals for these correlators, several indirect approaches have been developed to simplify computations. However, in momentum space, these methods have been limited to fields with integer spin. In this paper, we formulate tools for evaluating Witten diagrams with spin$-\frac12$ fields in momentum space and discuss where they differ from the corresponding integer-spin analysis. We formulate our tools explicitly for massless fermions and present how appropriate Weight shifting operators with respect to the external kinematics can be used to obtain the generalization to fermions with integer mass. We apply these tools to loop Witten diagrams and also discuss their use for evaluating in-in correlators in dS. In cases where we can evaluate the loop integrals, we find their transcendentality is lower than the corresponding scalar field results. Further, we classify the nature of IR divergences encountered for interacting massive scalars and fermions. We also prove a novel Weinberg-like soft theorem for gauge fields coupled to matter in AdS and show that the universal terms in the leading soft factor are sensitive to the spin of the matter field. These generalize the recently discovered soft theorems for pure Yang-Mills to Yang-Mills with matter.</description>

Abstract: We argue that holomorphic twists of supersymmetric field theories naturally come with a symmetry $L_\infty$-algebra that nontrivially extends holomorphic symmetry. This symmetry acts on spacetime fields only up to homotopy, and the extension is only visible at the level of higher components of the action. We explicitly compute this for the holomorphic twist of ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which produces a nontrivial action of a higher $L_\infty$-algebra on (a graded version) of five-dimensional affine space.</description>

      <title>Spin-2 operators in two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ quivers from massive type IIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of studying spin-2 fluctuations around a class of solutions in massive type IIA that is given by a warped $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{S}^2 \times \text{T}^4 \times \mathcal{I}_{\rho}$ and with $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ supersymmetry. We were able to identify a class of fluctuations, which is known as the ``minimal universal class'' that is independent of the background data and saturates the bound on the mass related to the field theory unitarity bound. These operators have conformal dimension $\Delta = 2(\ell+1)$, with $\ell$ being the quantum number of the angular momentum on the $\text{S}^2$. We also computed the normalisation of the $2$-point function of stress-energy tensors from the effective $3$-dimensional graviton action. We comment on the relation of our results to the related $\text{AdS}_3$ and $\text{AdS}_2$ solutions in massive type IIA and type IIB theories respectively.</description>

      <title>Early universe in quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new picture of the early universe in finite nonlocal quantum gravity, which is Weyl invariant at the classical and quantum levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a Weyl invariant trans-Planckian phase and a post-Planckian or Higgs phase described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness, and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by means of Weyl invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of the theory. In the second phase, once Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken, primordial perturbations are generated around a background that asymptotically evolves as a radiation-dominated flat Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended algebra of the free electromagnetic fields, including infrared singular fields, and the almost radial gauge, both introduced earlier, are postulated for the construction of the quantum electrodynamics in a Hilbert space (no indefinite metric). Both the Dirac and electromagnetic fields are constructed up to the first order (based on the incoming fields) as operators in the Hilbert space, and shown to have physically well interpretable asymptotic behavior in far past and spacelike separations. The Dirac field tends in far past to the free incoming field, carrying its own Coulomb field, but with no 'soft photon dressing'. The spacelike asymptotic limit of the electromagnetic field yields a conserved operator field, which is a sum of contributions of the incoming Coulomb field, and of the low energy limit of the incoming free electromagnetic field. This should agree with the operator field similarly constructed with the use of outgoing fields, which then relates these past and future characteristics. Higher orders are expected not to change this picture, but their construction needs a treatment of the UV question, which has not been undertaken and remains a problem for further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative method to explore gravity's quantum aspects using a novel theoretical framework. Our model delves into gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) while sidestepping classical communication limitations imposed by the LOCC principle. Specifically, we connect a non-relativistic two-dimensional quantum oscillator detector with linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs), leveraging the quantum properties inherent in GWs to observe GIE within the oscillator's quantum states. Because our model adheres to both the ``event" and the ``system" localities, the detected GIE serves as a robust indicator of gravity's quantum nature. Detecting this entanglement via gravitational wave detectors could corroborate gravity's quantization and unveil crucial properties of its sources.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of the Cosmological Dynamics of $O(D,D)$-complete Stringy Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>
