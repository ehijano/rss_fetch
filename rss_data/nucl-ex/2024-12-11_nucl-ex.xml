      <title>Atomic number estimation of dual energy cargo radiographs: initial experimental results using a semiempirical transparency model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To combat the risk of nuclear smuggling, radiography systems are deployed at ports to scan cargo containers for concealed illicit materials. Dual energy radiography systems enable a rough elemental analysis of cargo containers due to the Z-dependence of photon attenuation, allowing for improved material detection. This work presents our initial experimental findings using a novel approach to predict the atomic number of dual energy images of a loaded cargo container. We consider measurements taken by a Rapiscan Sentry Portal scanner, which is a dual energy betatron-based system used to inspect cargo containers and large vehicles. We demonstrate the ability to accurately fit our semiempirical transparency model to a set of calibration measurements. We then use the calibrated model to reconstruct the atomic number of an unknown material by minimizing the chi-squared error between the measured pixel values and the model predictions. We apply this methodology to two experimental scans of a loaded cargo container. First, we incorporate an image segmentation routine to group clusters of pixels into larger, roughly homogeneous objects. By considering groups of pixels, the subsequent atomic number reconstruction step produces a lower noise result. We demonstrate the ability to accurately reconstruct the atomic number of blocks of steel and high density polyethylene. Furthermore, we are able to identify the presence of two high-Z lead test objects, even when embedded within lower-Z organic shielding. These results demonstrate the significant potential of this methodology to yield improved performance characteristics over existing methods when applied to commercial dual energy systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring $ \Lambda{\text-} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, $ \Lambda{\text -} $triton(t) momentum correlation functions, to be measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are explored.
  Mainly, STAR detector acquired data for Au+Au collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV provides an opportunity to explore the $ \Lambda t $ correlation function.
  A Kurihara's isle-type and spin-averaged $ \Lambda t $ potential is employed.
  The strengths of $\Lambda t$ potential is tuned in a such way to reproduce the experimental ground state energy of $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ $ \left(\Lambda+t\right) $.
  Since the new measurements by the STAR Collaboration present a significant
  increase in the $\Lambda$ binding energy of the hypertriton and $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ hypernuclei,
  I investigate the sensitivity of correlation function by strengthen the $\Lambda t$ potential. Besides, even though there is no experimental data on the $ \Xi{\text -} $triton interaction yet, an estimate of its momentum correlation functions by taking $ \Xi{\text -} $triton potential from the literature is given.</description>

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness for $^{208}$Pb from total cross sections of neutron scattering at 14.137 MeV and neutron skin thickness for $^{48}$Ca, O, N, C isotopes from reaction and interaction cross sections</title>

Abstract: Foster {\it et al.} measured total neutron cross sections $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $14.137$MeV. Carlson {\it et al.} measured $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for $p$+$^{48}$Ca scattering in $23 \text{--} 48$MeV. Tanaka {\it et al.} measured $\sigma_{\rm I}$ for $^{42\text{--}51}$Ca + $^{12}$C scattering at 280MeV/u. Bagchi {\it et al.} measured the charge-changing (CC) cross sections and determined proton radii $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{14,15,17 \text{--} 22}$N from the CC cross sections. Kanungo {\it et al.} measured the CC cross sections and extracted $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{12\text{--} 19}$C. Kaur {\it et al.} measured the CC cross sections and determined $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{16,18 \text{--} 24}$O. Our 1st aim is to extract $r_{\rm skin}^{208}$ from the the $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $14.137$MeV. Our 2nd aim is to determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm skin})$ from $\sigma_{\rm R}$ on p+$^{48}$Ca scattering in $E_{\rm lab}=23 \text{--} 48$MeV. Our 3rd aim is to find light stable nuclei having nuclei having large $r_{\rm skin}$. We use the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model for lower $E_{\rm lab}$ and the folding model based on the Love-Franey $t$-matrix for higher $E_{\rm lab}$. We determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm skin})=0.163 \pm 0.037{\rm fm}$ from the $\sigma_{\rm R}$ on p+$^{48}$Ca scattering, using the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the D1M-GHFB+AMP proton and neutron densities. We show that D1M-GHFB+AMP is better than D1S-GHFB+AMP for the matter radius and the binding energy. Our skin value is consistent with $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm CREX})$. For C, N, O isotopes, we find that $r_{\rm skin}= 0.267 \pm 0.056$~fm for $^{14}$N and $r_{\rm skin}= 0.197 \pm 0.067$~fm for $^{17}$O. Our value $r_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.309 \pm 0.057$fm agrees with $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2})$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>
