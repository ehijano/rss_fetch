      <title>Refined HLA Linkage Disequilibrium Architectures of World Populations by a Novel Allelic Correlation Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders, are associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), a small genomic region located on human chromosome 6. Adequate characterization of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the HLA across populations is crucial for identifying genetic markers associated with specific traits and phenotypes. However, current LD measures often fail to capture HLA's structural complexity due to methodological limitations and sensitivity to low-frequency variants, marginal allele frequencies, and haplotype composition. To address these challenges, we introduced the Conditional Informatics Correlation Coefficient (CICC), which integrates conditional probability, information content, and haplotype-aware XOR logic to quantify LD robustly. When applied to high-resolution haploid genomes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), CICC revealed 10 novel high-LD regions in HLA. Further analyses using the 1000 Genomes Project and Genome Asia datasets identified nine strongly linked regions shared across five global populations-five in Class I and four in Class II. These results demonstrate CICC's ability to capture complex HLA LD structures across populations, highlighting its broad potential for disease gene mapping, population genomics, and guiding precision medicine.</description>

      <title>DeeDeeExperiment: Building an infrastructure for integrating and managing omics data analysis results in R/Bioconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: Modern omics experiments now involve multiple conditions and complex designs, producing an increasingly large set of differential expression and functional enrichment analysis results. However, no standardized data structure exists to store and contextualize these results together with their metadata, leaving researchers with an unmanageable and potentially non-reproducible collection of results that are difficult to navigate and/or share. Here we introduce DeeDeeExperiment, a new S4 class for managing and storing omics data analysis results, implemented within the Bioconductor ecosystem, which promotes interoperability, reproducibility and good documentation. This class extends the widely used SingleCellExperiment object by introducing dedicated slots for Differential Expression (DEA) and Functional Enrichment Analysis (FEA) results, allowing users to organize, store, and retrieve information on multiple contrasts and associated metadata within a single data object, ultimately streamlining the management and interpretation of many omics datasets. Availability and implementation: DeeDeeExperiment is available on Bioconductor under the MIT license (https://bioconductor.org/packages/DeeDeeExperiment), with its development version also available on Github (https://github.com/imbeimainz/DeeDeeExperiment).</description>
