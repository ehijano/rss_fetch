      <title>Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control for Nonlinear Structural System Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures remains a significant challenge in mechanics and engineering. Traditional physics-based models and data-driven approaches often struggle to simultaneously ensure model interpretability, noise robustness, and estimation optimality. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control (APSMC) framework. By integrating Kalman filter-based state estimation with physics-constrained proximal gradient optimization, the framework adaptively updates time-varying state-space model parameters while processing real-time input-output data under white noise disturbances. Theoretically, this process is equivalent to real-time tracking of the Jacobian matrix of a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we leverage the theoretical foundation of stochastic subspace identification to demonstrate that, as observational data accumulates, the APSMC algorithm yields state-space model estimates that converge to the theoretically optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations of a Duffing oscillator and the seismic response of a frame structure, as well as experimental tests on a scaled bridge model. Experimental results show that, under noisy conditions, APSMC successfully predicts 19 consecutive 10-second time series using only a single initial 10-second segment for model updating, achieving a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.398%. These findings demonstrate that the APSMC framework not only offers superior online identification and denoising performance but also provides a reliable foundation for downstream applications such as structural health monitoring, real-time control, adaptive filtering, and system identification.</description>

      <title>Impact of internal noise on convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of noise on a simplified trained convolutional network. The types of noise studied originate from a real optical implementation of a neural network, but we generalize these types to enhance the applicability of our findings on a broader scale. The noise types considered include additive and multiplicative noise, which relate to how noise affects individual neurons, as well as correlated and uncorrelated noise, which pertains to the influence of noise across one layers. We demonstrate that the propagation of uncorrelated noise primarily depends on the statistical properties of the connection matrices. Specifically, the mean value of the connection matrix following the layer impacted by noise governs the propagation of correlated additive noise, while the mean of its square contributes to the accumulation of uncorrelated noise. Additionally, we propose an analytical assessment of the noise level in the network's output signal, which shows a strong correlation with the results of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy self-balance as the physical basis of orbit quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that work done by the non conservative forces along a stable limit cycle attractor of a dissipative dynamical system is always equal to zero. Thus, mechanical energy is preserved on average along periodic orbits. This balance between energy gain and energy loss along different phases of the self sustained oscillation is responsible for the existence of quantized orbits in such systems. Furthermore, we show that the instantaneous preservation of projected phase space areas along quantized orbits describes the neutral dynamics of the phase, allowing us to derive from this equation the Wilson Sommerfeld like quantization condition. We apply our general results to near Hamiltonian systems, identifying the fixed points of Krylov Bogoliubov radial equation governing the dynamics of the limit cycles with the zeros of the Melnikov function. Moreover, we relate the instantaneous preservation of the phase space area along the quantized orbits to the second Krylov Bogoliubov equation describing the dynamics of the phase. We test the two quantization conditions in the context of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, where a megastable spectra of quantized orbits have recently been discovered. Specifically, we use a generalized pilot wave model for a walking droplet confined in a harmonic potential, and find a countably infinite set of nested limit cycle attractors representing a classical analog of quantized orbits. We compute the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of this self excited system.</description>

      <title>Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.</description>

      <title>Locally Optimal Percolation for Network Resilience Dismantling via Fiedler Vector Gradient Iterative Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network resilience, dynamically quantified by the Fiedler value (\(\lambda_2\),the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix) ensures functional stability and efficient energy transmission, yet also introduces vulnerabilities that dismantling the resilience of the network can cause a functional breakdown of the network. However, traditional percolation strategies focused on structural attacks often fail to effectively affect resilience and lack universal applicability. Here, we employ a Laplacian spectral perturbation approach to systematically identify and remove edges critical to resilience. We derive the sensitivity of \(\lambda_2\) to topological changes and employ the gradient of Fiedler vector to measure each edge's contribution of resilience, revealing an intrinsic relationship to community partition. Accordingly, we propose the Fiedler Gradient Iterative Attack (FGIA) algorithm, which constructs locally optimal edge removal sequences to maximize \(\lambda_2\) degradation with significantly lower computational cost than brute-force methods. Our results offer a rigorous approach for inducing controlled resilience collapse, with potential applications in neuroscience and critical infrastructure protection.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multi-View Fidelity in Autonomous UAV Swarm Sport Injury Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, real-time collision detection is essential for ensuring player safety and effective refereeing in high-contact sports such as rugby, particularly given the severe risks associated with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Traditional collision-monitoring methods employing fixed cameras or wearable sensors face limitations in visibility, coverage, and responsiveness. Previously, we introduced a framework using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring and real time kinematics extraction from videos of collision events. In this paper, we show that the strategies operating on the objective of ensuring at least one UAV captures every incident on the pitch have an emergent property of fulfilling a stronger key condition for successful kinematics extraction. Namely, they ensure that almost all collisions are captured by multiple drones, establishing multi-view fidelity and redundancy, while not requiring any drone-to-drone communication.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation and competition in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation and competition coexist and coevolve in natural and social systems. Cooperation generates resources, which in turn, drive non-cooperative competition to secure individual shares. How this complex interplay between cooperation and competition shapes the evolution of social dilemmas and welfare remains unknown. In this study, we introduce a two-layer evolutionary game model, in which one layer is a cooperative public goods game, and the other is a competitive involution game, with cross-layer feedback linking the two. We find that feedback can either promote or inhibit cooperation, depending on the baseline conditions. For example, moderate resource and synergy factor values can promote social welfare when feedback strength is large. This provides an approach to adjusting the strength and asymmetry of cross-layer feedback to promote cooperation and social welfare. We thus emphasize the importance of managing feedback mechanisms to balance cooperation and competition in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary advantage of guilt: co-evolution of social and non-social guilt in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building ethical machines may involve bestowing upon them the emotional capacity to self-evaluate and repent on their actions. While apologies represent potential strategic interactions, the explicit evolution of guilt as a behavioural trait remains poorly understood. Our study delves into the co-evolution of two forms of emotional guilt: social guilt entails a cost, requiring agents to exert efforts to understand others' internal states and behaviours; and non-social guilt, which only involves awareness of one's own state, incurs no social cost. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying structure of the systems of agents. Our findings reveal that in lattice and scale-free networks, strategies favouring emotional guilt dominate a broader range of guilt and social costs compared to non-structured well-mixed populations, so leading to higher levels of cooperation. In structured populations, both social and non-social guilt can thrive through clustering with emotionally inclined strategies, thereby providing protection against exploiters, particularly for less costly non-social strategies. These insights shed light on the complex interplay of guilt and cooperation, enhancing our understanding of ethical artificial intelligence.</description>
