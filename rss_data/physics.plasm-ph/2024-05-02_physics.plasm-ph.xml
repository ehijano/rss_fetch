      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the phase diagram of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized two-dimensional uniform electron liquids using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) methods with Slater-Jastrow-backflow trial wave functions. Ground-state VMC and DMC energies are obtained in the density range $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 40$. Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are corrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and extrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC energies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are discussed. We find that, for $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 5$, optimizing the backflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite system size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the DMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple finite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic effects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at different system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic limit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation functional for inhomogeneous electron systems. Our zero-temperature phase diagram shows a single transition from a paramagnetic fluid to a hexagonal Wigner crystal at $r_\text{s}=35(1)$, with no region of stability for a ferromagnetic fluid.</description>

      <title>Saturation Level of Ion Weibel Instability and Isotropization Length Scale in Electron-Ion Weibel-Mediated Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion Weibel instability is considered to be the dominant physics for the dissipation in high-Mach number astrophysical shocks such as supernova remnant shocks and gamma-ray burst shocks. We study the instability dependence on various parameters using theory and particle-in-cell simulations. We demonstrate that electron physics determines the saturation level of the Weibel-generated magnetic field, even though the instability is driven by the ions. We discuss the application to astrophysical and laboratory laser experiment environments to clarify the roles of the ion Weibel instability. We develop a model for the isotropization length scale in Weibel-mediated shocks and compare its value to other characteristic length scales of each system. We find that electron heating to near equipartition is crucial for the formation of ultra-relativistic Weibel-mediated shocks. On the other hand, our results imply that non-relativistic shocks in typical interstellar medium are not purely mediated by the Weibel instability.</description>

      <title>Canonical variables based numerical schemes for hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical variables based numerical schemes of a hybrid model with kinetic ions and mass-less electrons. Two equivalent formulations of the hybrid model are presented with the vector potentials in different gauges and the distribution functions depending on canonical momentum (not velocity), which constitutes a pair of canonical variables with the position variable. Particle-in-cell methods are used for the distribution functions, and the vector potentials are discretized by the finite element methods in the framework of finite element exterior calculus. Splitting methods are used for the time discretizations. It is illustrated that the second formulation is numerically superior and the schemes constructed based on the anti-symmetric bracket proposed have better conservation properties and lower noise, although the filters can be used to improve the schemes of the first formulation.</description>
