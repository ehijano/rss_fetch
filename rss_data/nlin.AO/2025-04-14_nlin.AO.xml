      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and Phase Transitions in the Origins of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The path toward the emergence of life in our biosphere involved several key events allowing for the persistence, reproduction and evolution of molecular systems. All these processes took place in a given environmental context and required both molecular diversity and the right non-equilibrium conditions to sustain and favour complex self-sustaining molecular networks capable of evolving by natural selection. Life is a process that departs from non-life in several ways and cannot be reduced to standard chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving higher levels of complexity required the emergence of novelties. How did that happen? Here, we review different case studies associated with the early origins of life in terms of phase transitions and bifurcations, using symmetry breaking and percolation as two central components. We discuss simple models that allow for understanding key steps regarding life origins, such as molecular chirality, the transition to the first replicators and cooperators, the problem of error thresholds and information loss, and the potential for "order for free" as the basis for the emergence of life.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control in Soft and Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft and active condensed matter represent a class of fascinating materials that we encounter in our everyday lives -- and constitute life itself. Control signals interact with the dynamics of these systems, and this influence is formalized in control theory and optimal control. Recent advances have employed various control-theoretical methods to design desired dynamics, properties, and functionality. Here we provide an introduction to optimal control aimed at physicists working with soft and active matter. We describe two main categories of control, feedforward control and feedback control, and their corresponding optimal control methods. We emphasize their parallels to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and provide a worked example problem. Finally, we review recent studies of control in soft, active, and related systems. Applying control theory to soft, active, and living systems will lead to an improved understanding of the signal processing, information flows, and actuation that underlie the physics of life.</description>

      <title>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</description>
