      <title>Using 3.4-$\mu$m Variability towards White Dwarfs as a Signpost of Remnant Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 $\mu$m, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 $\mu$m that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4-$\mu$m light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4-$\mu$m variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4-$\mu$m variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.</description>

      <title>Fundamentalization of periods for first and second-overtone classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost half of all classical Cepheids do not pulsate in fundamental mode, and nowadays, the fundamentalization of their higher-mode periods is frequently applied to increase the sample size in astrophysical investigations and allow for comparison with fundamental-mode Cepheids. On the other hand, the relations used to obtain fundamentalized periods are either old or based on small samples that cover narrow period ranges. We used available data of 989 Cepheids pulsating in at least two modes to obtain modern, high-quality empirical fundamentalization relations applicable in a wide range of periods of first- and second-overtone Cepheids for metallicities typical for the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. A clear correlation between the features of these relations and metallicity is seen, and periods with lower sensitivity to metallicity are identified. We also compare our results with double-mode Cepheids from the M31 and M33 galaxies. For the first galaxy, this indicates Cepheids have metallicities from supersolar to typical for the LMC, while for the latter, from solar to typical for the SMC. A general discussion of the usage of a different type of fundamentalization relations depending on the scientific problem is included.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Complex Ionization Environment of the Turbulent DM Tau Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival ALMA observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are post-processed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced CR ionization rate ($\zeta_{CR}$ ~ 10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio [HR] = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model under-produces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau's inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high resolution multi-line studies.</description>

      <title>Li Evolution Among Stars of Low/Intermediate Mass: The Metal-Deficient Open Cluster, NGC 2204</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed high-dispersion spectra in the Li 6708 Angstrom region for 167 stars within the anticenter cluster, NGC 2204. From 105 probable members, abundance analysis of 45 evolved stars produces [Fe/H] = -0.40 +/- 0.12, [Si/Fe] = 0.14 +/- 0.12, [Ca/Fe] = 0.29 +/- 0.07, and [Ni/Fe] = -0.12 +/- 0.10, where quoted errors are standard deviations. With E(B-V) = 0.07 and (m-M)_0 = 13.12, appropriate isochrones provide an excellent match from the main sequence through the tip of the giant branch for an age of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Gyr. Li spectrum synthesis produces A(Li) below 1.4 at the base of the red giant branch to a detectable value of -0.4 at the tip. Six probable AGB stars and all but one red clump star have only Li upper limits. A rapidly rotating red giant is identified as a possible Li-rich giant, assuming it is a red clump star. Main sequence turnoff stars have a well-defined A(Li) = 2.83 +/- 0.03 (sem) down to the Li-dip wall at the predicted mass of 1.29 solar masses. Despite the same isochronal age as the more metal-rich NGC 2506, the red giant luminosity distribution reflects a younger morphology similar to NGC 7789, possibly indicating a deeper metallicity impact on stellar structure and A(Li) than previously assumed. As in NGC 2506 and NGC 7789, the NGC 2204 turnoff exhibits a broad range of rotation speeds, making abundance estimation impossible for some stars. The cluster place within Galactic A(Li) evolution is discussed.</description>

      <title>The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars: Over 18 000 Rotating Variables toward the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation, a key factor influencing stellar structure and evolution, also drives magnetic activity, which is manifested as spots or flares on stellar surface. Here, we present a collection of 18 443 rotating variables located toward the Galactic bulge, identified in the photometric database of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project. These stars exhibit distinct magnetic activity, including starspots and flares. With this collection, we provide long-term, time-series photometry in Cousins I- and Johnson V-band obtained by OGLE since 1997, and basic observational parameters, i.e., equatorial coordinates, rotation periods, mean brightness, and brightness amplitudes in both bands. This is a unique dataset for studying stellar magnetic activity, including activity cycles.</description>

      <title>Digging deeper into the dense Galactic globular cluster Terzan 5 with Electron-Multiplying CCDs. Variable star detection and new discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. High frame-rate imaging was employed to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing) in observations of globular cluster Terzan 5.
  Aims. High-precision time-series photometry has been obtained with the highest angular resolution so far taken in the crowded central region of Terzan 5, with ground-based telescopes, and ways to avoid saturation of the brightest stars in the field observed.
  Methods. The Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera installed at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory was employed to produce thousands of short-exposure time images (ten images per second) that were stacked to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). We employed difference image analysis in the stacked images to produce high-precision photometry using the DanDIA pipeline.
  Results. Light curves of 1670 stars with 242 epochs were analyzed in the crowded central region of Terzan 5 to statistically detect variable stars in the field observed. We present a possible visual counterpart outburst at the position of the pulsar J1748-2446N, and the visual counterpart light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary CX 3. Additionally, we present the discovery of 4 semiregular variables. We also present updated ephemerides and properties of the only RR Lyrae star previously known in the field covered by our observations in Terzan 5. Finally, we report a significant displacement of two sources by ~0.62 and 0.59 arcseconds with respect to their positions in previous images available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Origin of extended Main Sequence Turn Off in open cluster NGC 2355</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the open clusters has been attributed to various factors, such as spread in rotation rates, binary stars, and dust-like extinction from stellar excretion discs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the eMSTO in the open cluster NGC 2355. Using spectra from the Gaia-ESO archives, we find that the stars in the red part of the eMSTO have a higher mean v sin i value of 135.3$\pm$4.6 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the stars in the blue part that have an average v sin i equal to 81.3$\pm$5.6 km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that the eMSTO in NGC 2355 is possibly caused by the spread in rotation rates of stars. We do not find any substantial evidence of the dust-like extinction from the eMSTO stars using ultraviolet data from the Swift survey. The estimated synchronization time for low mass ratio close binaries in the blue part of the eMSTO suggests that they would be mostly slow-rotating if present. However, the stars in the blue part of the eMSTO are preferentially located in the outer region of the cluster indicating that they may lack low mass ratio close binaries. The spread in rotation rates of eMSTO stars in NGC 2355 is most likely caused by the star-disc interaction mechanism. The stars in the lower main sequence beyond the eMSTO region of NGC 2355 are slow-rotating (mean v sin i = 26.5$\pm$1.3 km s$^{-1}$) possibly due to the magnetic braking of their rotations.</description>

      <title>Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \pm 0.019(stat.) \pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance). Further study of SARGs will unravel the impact of population diversity on TRGB distances and further improve TRGB standardization.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) X. Probing the early chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy with carbon abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon abundances, especially at low metallicity, reveal the early chemical evolution of a system, tracing the supernovae (SNe) that contributed and how much of their ejecta made it into the next stellar generation. Our sample from the \textit{Pristine} Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes $\sim 350$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-1.5$) stars in the main body of Sgr with good quality spectroscopic observations. Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Pop III and II SNe, thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\sim 6.8\times 10^{-4}$ dex arcmin$^{-1}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$&gt;+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mid-Infrared Spectral-Timing with JWST. I. The prototypical black hole X-ray Binary GRS 1915+105 during a MIR-bright and X-ray-obscured state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared (MIR) spectral-timing measurements of the prototypical Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105. The source was observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST in June 2023 at a MIR luminosity L(MIR)~10^{36} erg/s exceeding past IR levels by about a factor of 10. By contrast, the X-ray flux is much fainter than the historical average, in the source's now-persistent 'obscured' state. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum shows a plethora of emission lines, the strongest of which are consistent with recombination in the hydrogen Pfund (Pf) series and higher. Low amplitude (~1%) but highly significant peak-to-peak photometric variability is found on timescales of ~1,000 s. The brightest Pf(6-5) emission line lags the continuum. Though difficult to constrain accurately, this lag is commensurate with light-travel timescales across the outer accretion disc or with expected recombination timescales inferred from emission line diagnostics. Using the emission line as a bolometric indicator suggests a moderate (~5-30% Eddington) intrinsic accretion rate. Multiwavelength monitoring shows that JWST caught the source close in-time to unprecedentedly bright MIR and radio long-term flaring. Assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the MIRI continuum suggests an unsustainably high mass-loss rate during this time unless the wind remains bound, though other possible origins cannot be ruled out. PAH features previously detected with Spitzer are now less clear in the MIRI data, arguing for possible destruction of dust in the interim. These results provide a preview of new parameter space for exploring MIR spectral-timing in XRBs and other variable cosmic sources on rapid timescales.</description>

      <title>Absence of a Correlation between White Dwarf Planetary Accretion and Primordial Stellar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a quarter of white dwarfs have photospheric metal pollution, which is evidence for recent accretion of exoplanetary material. While a wide range of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this pollution, there are currently few observational constraints to differentiate between them. To investigate the driving mechanism, we observe a sample of polluted and non-polluted white dwarfs in wide binary systems with main-sequence stars. Using the companion stars' metallicities as a proxy for the white dwarfs' primordial metallicities, we compare the metallicities of polluted and non-polluted systems. Because there is a well-known correlation between giant planet occurrence and higher metallicity (with a stronger correlation for close-in and eccentric planets), these metallicity distributions can be used to probe the role of gas giants in white dwarf accretion. We find that the metallicity distributions of polluted and non-polluted systems are consistent with the hypothesis that both samples have the same underlying metallicity distribution. However, we note that this result is likely biased by several selection effects. Additionally, we find no significant trend between white dwarf accretion rates and metallicity. These findings suggest that giant planets are not the dominant cause of white dwarf accretion events in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Tidal tails of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters that emerged from the star forming regions as gravitationally bound structures are subjected to star evaporation, ejection, and tidal forces throughout the rest of their lives. Consequently they form tidal tails that can stretch kiloparsecs along the cluster's orbit. Aims. Cluster members are typically found by searching for overdensities in some parameter space (positions and velocities or sometimes actions and orbital parameters of stars). However, this method is not effective in identifying stars located in the tidal tails far from the open cluster cores. We present a probabilistic method for finding distant cluster members without relying on searching for overdensities and apply it to 476 open clusters. Methods. First, we simulate the dissolution of a cluster and obtain a probability distribution (likelihood) describing where cluster members are to be found. The distribution of stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue in high likelihood regions is then compared to the simulated stellar population of the Galaxy to define the membership probability of each star. Results. The survey of cluster members included all stars with a magnitude of G &lt; 17.5 and larger clusters with an age of &gt; 100 Myr within 3 kpc from the Sun. We successfully find stars with high membership probabilities in the tidal tails of most clusters, stretching more than a kiloparsec from the cluster cores in some cases. We analyse the morphological properties of tidal tails, demonstrate how properly normalised membership probabilities aid systematic studies of open clusters and publish a catalogue of stars found in the tidal tails.</description>

      <title>A Star Cluster Population of High Mass Black Hole Mergers in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars. This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters. This population becomes dominant above $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$, which we interpret as the lower edge of the pair-instability mass gap. Upcoming data will enable us to tightly constrain the hierarchical formation hypothesis and refine our understanding of binary black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach predicts a lower binding energy for benzene on water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a highly accurate value for the binding energy of benzene to proton-ordered crystalline water ice (XIh), as a model for interstellar ices. We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming (usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.</description>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Cooling in Radiative Transfer Modeling of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities $&lt;2000 \mathrm{km/s}$ where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at $\sim 4.5\mathrm{\mu m}$, which accounts for up to 20% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.</description>

      <title>Stellar/BH Population in AGN Disks: Direct Binary Formation from Capture Objects in Nuclei Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Active Galatic Nuclei(AGN) disk has been proposed as a potential channel for the merger of binary black holes. The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk. Direct binary formation right after the capture would be promising, especially for stars. The conventional migration traps that help pile up single objects in AGN disks for black hole mergers might not be required.</description>

      <title>Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST. I. Strategy and First Results of Dusty Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST imaging survey of I Zw 18, the archetypal extremely metal-poor, star-forming (SF), blue compact dwarf galaxy. With an oxygen abundance of only $\sim$3% $Z_{\odot}$, it is among the lowest-metallicity systems known in the local Universe, and is, therefore, an excellent accessible analog for the galactic building blocks which existed at early epochs of ionization and star formation. These JWST data provide a comprehensive infrared (IR) view of I Zw 18 with eight filters utilizing both Near Infrared Camera (F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F1800W) photometry, which we have used to identify key stellar populations that are bright in the near- and mid-IR. These data allow for a better understanding of the origins of dust and dust-production mechanisms in metal-poor environments by characterizing the population of massive, evolved stars in the red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. In addition, it enables the identification of the brightest dust-enshrouded young stellar objects (YSOs), which provide insight into the formation of massive stars at extremely low metallicities typical of the very early Universe. This paper provides an overview of the observational strategy and data processing, and presents first science results, including identifications of dusty AGB, RSG, and bright YSO candidates. These first results assess the scientific quality of JWST data and provide a guide for obtaining and interpreting future observations of the dusty and evolved stars inhabiting compact dwarf SF galaxies in the local Universe.</description>
