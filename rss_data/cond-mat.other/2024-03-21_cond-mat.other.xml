      <title>All-magnonic repeater based on bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistability, a universal phenomenon found in diverse fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics, describes a scenario in which a system has two stable equilibrium states and resets to one of the two states. The ability to switch between these two states is the basis for a wide range of applications, particularly in memory and logic operations. Here, we present a universal approach to achieve bistable switching in magnonics, the field processing data using spin waves. As an exemplary application, we use magnonic bistability to experimentally demonstrate the still missing magnonic repeater. A pronounced bistable window is observed in a 1um wide magnonic conduit under an external rf drive characterized by two magnonic stable states defined as low and high spin-wave amplitudes. The switching between these two states is realized by another propagating spin wave sent into the rf driven region. This magnonic bistable switching is used to design the magnonic repeater, which receives the original decayed and distorted spin wave and regenerates a new spin wave with amplified amplitude and normalized phase. Our magnonic repeater is proposed to be installed at the inputs of each magnonic logic gate to overcome the spin-wave amplitude degradation and phase distortion during previous propagation and achieve integrated magnonic circuits or magnonic neuromorphic networks.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect driven by phonon-magnon hybridization in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van de Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle ($\kappa_{ab}/\kappa_{aa}/B$) respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The exponential temperature dependence of $\kappa_{ab}$ above its peak reveals an energy scale on the order of magnitude of the gap expected to be opened by magnon-phonon hybridization. This points to an intrinsic scenario for THE with possible relevance to other magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Corner and Edge States in Topological Sierpinski Carpet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in novel ways. Here we present a theoretical discussion on localized corner and edge states, as well as electronic properties emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological hopping parameter phase diagram is constructed from which different spatial localized states are identified following signatures of distinct fractal generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge states that carrier the details of the Sierpinski Carpet topology.</description>

      <title>Overhead-constrained circuit knitting for variational quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena. While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations, their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD) algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension where the boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. Quench processes that start deep in the Mott phase and end in the weak Mott phase show light-cone-like spreading in the dipole correlation function but not in the single-boson correlator, which is suppressed due to the dipole conservation. The phase and the group velocities estimated from the dilute-dipolon approximation are in excellent agreement with those of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle method. The quench from the dipole-condensed (DC) phase to the Mott phase shows periodic kinks in the Loschmidt echo and the demise and revival of Bose-condensed peaks in the dipole momentum distribution function, both of which are noted features of dynamical quantum phase transition. The Mott-to-DC quench, on the other hand, shows none of these features despite the quench parameters varying across the equilibrium quantum critical point. Our findings on the fractonic quench dynamics can be checked in the tilted optical lattice experiment.</description>
