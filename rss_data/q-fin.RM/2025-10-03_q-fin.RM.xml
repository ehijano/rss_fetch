      <title>Robust risk evaluation of joint life insurance under dependence uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Dependence among multiple lifetimes is a key factor for pricing and evaluating the risk of joint life insurance products. The dependence structure can be exposed to model uncertainty when available data and information are limited. We address robust pricing and risk evaluation of joint life insurance products against dependence uncertainty among lifetimes. We first show that, for some class of standard contracts, the risk evaluation based on distortion risk measure is monotone with respect to the concordance order of the underlying copula. Based on this monotonicity, we then study the most conservative and anti-conservative risk evaluations for this class of contracts. We prove that the bounds for the mean, Value-at-Risk and Expected shortfall are computed by a combination of linear programs when the uncertainty set is defined by some norm-ball centered around a reference copula. Our numerical analysis reveals that the sensitivity of the risk evaluation against the choice of the copula differs depending on the risk measure and the type of the contract, and our proposed bounds can improve the existing bounds based on the available information.</description>
