      <title>Testing and learning structured quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problems of testing and learning an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ from queries to its evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ under the normalized Frobenius norm. We prove:
  1. Local Hamiltonians: We give a tolerant testing protocol to decide if $H$ is $\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\epsilon_2$-far from $k$-local, with $O(1/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^{4})$ queries, solving open questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm et al. For learning a $k$-local $H$ up to error $\epsilon$, we give a protocol with query complexity $\exp(O(k^2+k\log(1/\epsilon)))$ independent of $n$, by leveraging the non-commutative Bohnenblust-Hille inequality.
  2. Sparse Hamiltonians: We give a protocol to test if $H$ is $\epsilon_1$-close to being $s$-sparse (in the Pauli basis) or $\epsilon_2$-far from being $s$-sparse, with $O(s^{6}/(\epsilon_2^2-\epsilon_1^2)^{6})$ queries. For learning up to error $\epsilon$, we show that $O(s^{4}/\epsilon^{8})$ queries suffice.
  3. Learning without memory: The learning results stated above have no dependence on $n$, but require $n$-qubit quantum memory. We give subroutines that allow us to learn without memory; increasing the query complexity by a $(\log n)$-factor in the local case and an $n$-factor in the sparse case.
  4. Testing without memory: We give a new subroutine called Pauli hashing, which allows one to tolerantly test $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with $O(s^{14}/(\epsilon_2^2-\epsilon_1^2)^{18})$ queries. A key ingredient is showing that $s$-sparse Pauli channels can be tolerantly tested under the diamond norm with $O(s^2/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^6)$ queries.
  Along the way, we prove new structural theorems for local and sparse Hamiltonians. We complement our learning results with polynomially weaker lower bounds. Furthermore, our algorithms use short time evolutions and do not assume prior knowledge of the terms in the support of the Pauli spectrum of $H$.</description>

      <title>A Universal Quantum Computer From Relativistic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits' trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact non-perturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to Problem Sizes: An Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a transformative technology with the announced potential to solve large-scale problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. Despite impressive milestones, however, classical computing continues to make rapid progress, narrowing the performance gap. Moreover, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems. Due to error correction techniques, quantum computers potentially require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale quantum experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers. The results emphasize that equipment of quantum error correction has a substantial impact on quantum computers due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. When comparing quantum computers to classical supercomputers, the latter generally has a higher environmental impact in terms of Climate change, Ecosystems, and Human health, because of the number of computing blades and their total energy use.</description>

      <title>Compact optical waveform generator with digital feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key requirement for quantum technologies based on atoms, ions, and molecules, is the ability to realize precise phase- and amplitude-controlled quantum operations via coherent laser pulses. However, for generating pulses on the sub-microsecond timescale, the characteristics of the optical and electronic components can introduce unwanted distortions that have a detrimental effect on the fidelity of quantum operations. In this paper, we present a compact arbitrary waveform generator that integrates a double-pass acousto-optic modulator for user-specified laser amplitude and phase modulations. Additionally, the module integrates an optical heterodyne detector to extract the precise laser pulse shape in real-time. The measured pulse shape is then fed into a digital feedback loop used to estimate the complex-valued transfer function and pre-distorted input pulses. We demonstrate the performance by generating shaped laser pulses suitable for realizing quantum logic gates with durations down to 180\,ns, requiring only a small number of feedback iterations.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>From Easy to Hard: Tackling Quantum Problems with Learned Gadgets For Real Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building quantum circuits that perform a given task is a notoriously difficult problem. Reinforcement learning has proven to be a powerful approach, but many limitations remain due to the exponential scaling of the space of possible operations on qubits. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that automatically learns composite gates ("$gadgets$") and adds them as additional actions to the reinforcement learning agent to facilitate the search, namely the Gadget Reinforcement Learning (GRL) algorithm. We apply our algorithm to finding parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that implement the ground state of a given quantum Hamiltonian, a well-known NP-hard challenge. In particular, we focus on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM), since understanding its ground state is crucial for studying quantum phase transitions and critical behavior, and serves as a benchmark for validating quantum algorithms and simulation techniques. We show that with GRL we can find very compact PQCs that improve the error in estimating the ground state of TFIM by up to $10^7$ fold and make it suitable for implementation on real hardware compared to a pure reinforcement learning approach. Moreover, GRL scales better with increasing difficulty and to larger systems. The generality of the algorithm shows the potential for applications to other settings, including optimization tailored to specific real-world quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Chasing shadows with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinitude of the continuous variable (CV) phase space is a serious obstacle in designing randomized tomography schemes with provable performance guarantees. A typical strategy to circumvent this issue is to impose a regularization, such as a photon-number cutoff, to enable the definition of ensembles of random unitaries on effective subspaces. In this work, we consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. In particular, we construct a logical shadow tomography protocol via twirling of CV-POVMs by displacement operators and Gaussian unitaries. In the special case of heterodyne measurement, the shadow tomography protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code and we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon-parity measurements, logical GKP shadow tomography is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling schemes and finally, using the existence of a Haar measure over symplectic lattices, we derive a Wigner sampling scheme via random GKP codes. This protocol establishes, via explicit sample complexity bounds, how Wigner samples of any input state from random points relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable on CV space.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum circuit design for QFT-based arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we create a scalable version of the quantum Fourier transform-based arithmetic circuit to perform addition and subtraction operations on N n-bit unsigned integers encoded in quantum registers, and it is compatible with d-level quantum sources, called qudits. We present qubit- and ququart-based multi-input QFT adders, and we compare and discuss potential benefits such as circuit simplicity and noise sensitivity. The results show that a ququart-based system significantly reduces gate count and improves computational efficiency compared to qubit-based systems. Overall, the findings presented in this study represent a promising step forward in the development of efficient quantum arithmetic circuits, particularly for multi-input operations, with clear advantages for ququart-based systems in reducing gate count, decoherence, and circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Path Selection and Qubit Allocation via Adversarial Group Neural Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Data Networks (QDNs) have emerged as a promising framework in the field of information processing and transmission, harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. QDNs utilize a quantum teleportation technique through long-distance entanglement connections, encoding data information in quantum bits (qubits). Despite being a cornerstone in various quantum applications, quantum entanglement encounters challenges in establishing connections over extended distances due to probabilistic processes influenced by factors like optical fiber losses. The creation of long-distance entanglement connections between quantum computers involves multiple entanglement links and entanglement swapping techniques through successive quantum nodes, including quantum computers and quantum repeaters, necessitating optimal path selection and qubit allocation. Current research predominantly assumes known success rates of entanglement links between neighboring quantum nodes and overlooks potential network attackers. This paper addresses the online challenge of optimal path selection and qubit allocation, aiming to learn the best strategy for achieving the highest success rate of entanglement connections between two chosen quantum computers without prior knowledge of the success rate and in the presence of a QDN attacker. The proposed approach is based on multi-armed bandits, specifically adversarial group neural bandits, which treat each path as a group and view qubit allocation as arm selection. Our contributions encompass formulating an online adversarial optimization problem, introducing the EXPNeuralUCB bandits algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees, and conducting comprehensive simulations to showcase its superiority over established advanced algorithms.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to significant research into applying quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) is particularly noteworthy, representing a classic and critical example in the field. Since the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing algorithms for its resolution, which have been fundamental to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to the TDP remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle the TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse array of parameters. Our experimental findings indicate that QAOA is effective in addressing the TDP; under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes the correct total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon the specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for addressing the TDP and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this area.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Analysis for the Decoy-State Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is a cornerstone of quantum cryptography, enabling secure communication through the principles of quantum mechanics. In reality, most practical implementations rely on the decoy-state method to ensure security against photon-number-splitting attacks. A significant challenge in realistic quantum cryptosystems arises from statistical fluctuations with finite data sizes, which complicate the key-rate estimation due to the nonlinear dependence on the phase error rate. In this study, we first revisit and improve the key rate bound for the decoy-state method. We then propose an enhanced framework for statistical fluctuation analysis. By employing our fluctuation analysis on the improved bound, we demonstrate enhancement in key generation rates through numerical simulations with typical experimental parameters. Furthermore, our approach to fluctuation analysis is not only applicable in quantum cryptography but can also be adapted to other quantum information processing tasks, particularly when the objective and experimental variables exhibit a linear relationship.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabatic state transfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontrivial spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems can give rise to intriguing effects that lack counterparts in Hermitian systems. For instance, when dynamically varying system parameters along a path enclosing an exceptional point (EP), chiral mode conversion occurs. A recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 113802 (2024)] demonstrates the achievability of pure adiabatic state transfer by specifically selecting a trajectory in the system parameter space where the corresponding evolution operator exhibits a real spectrum while winding around an EP. However, considering the impact of nonadiabatic transitions reveals the fragility of intended adiabatic state transfer. In this work, we propose a scheme for achieving robust and rapid adiabatic state transfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems by appropriately modulating system Hamiltonian and time-evolution trajectory. Numerical simulations confirm that complete adiabatic transfer can always be achieved even under nonadiabatic conditions after one period for different initialized adiabatic states, and the scheme remains insensitive to moderate fluctuations in control parameters. Therefore, this scheme offers alternative approaches for quantum-state engineering in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear algebra for disordered electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons on exponentially many lattice sites. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or exponential localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. We overcome this by simulating an exponentially large disorder instance using a block-encoded hopping matrix of physical form where disorder is introduced by pseudorandom functions. Key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, can then be computed using quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation.</description>

      <title>One for All: Universal Quantum Conic Programming Framework for Hard-Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum-classical framework for addressing NP-complete constrained combinatorial optimization problems, generalizing the recently proposed Quantum Conic Programming (QCP) approach. Accordingly, it inherits many favorable properties of the original proposal such as mitigation of the effects of barren plateaus and avoidance of NP-hard parameter optimization. By collecting the entire classical feasibility structure in a single constraint, we enlarge QCP's scope to arbitrary hard-constrained problems. Yet, we prove that the additional restriction is mild enough to still allow for an efficient parameter optimization via the formulation of a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) of adaptable dimension. Our rigorous proof further fills some apparent gaps in prior derivations of GEPs from parameter optimization problems. We further detail a measurement protocol for formulating the classical parameter optimization that does not require us to implement any (time evolution with a) problem-specific objective Hamiltonian or a quantum feasibility oracle. Lastly, we prove that, even under the influence of noise, QCP's parameterized ansatz class always captures the optimum attainable within its generated subcone.

      <title>Quantum-centric computation of molecular excited states with extended sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of molecular electronic structure is an important application of quantum devices. Recently, it has been shown that quantum devices can be effectively combined with classical supercomputing centers in the context of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) algorithm. This allowed the largest electronic structure quantum simulation to date (77 qubits) and opened near-term devices to practical use cases in chemistry toward the hundred-qubit mark. However, the description of many important physical and chemical properties of those systems, such as photo-absorption/-emission, requires a treatment that goes beyond the ground state alone. In this work, we extend the SQD algorithm to determine low-lying molecular excited states. The extended-SQD method improves over the original SQD method in accuracy, at the cost of an additional computational step. It also improves over quantum subspace expansion based on single and double electronic excitations, a widespread approach to excited states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices, in both accuracy and efficiency. We employ the extended SQD method to compute the first singlet (S$_1$) and triplet (T$_1$) excited states of the nitrogen molecule with a correlation-consistent basis set, and the ground- and excited-state properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster.</description>

      <title>Transition Path and Interface Sampling of Stochastic Schr\"odinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rare transitions in Markovian open quantum systems driven with Gaussian noise, applying transition path and interface sampling methods to trajectories generated by stochastic Schr\"odinger dynamics. Interface and path sampling offer insights into rare event transition mechanisms while simultaneously establishing a quantitative measure of the associated rate constant. Here, we extend their domain to systems described by stochastic Schr\"odinger equations. As a specific example, we explore a model of quantum Brownian motion in a quartic double well, consisting of a particle coupled to a Caldeira-Leggett oscillator bath, where we note significant departures from the Arrhenius law at low temperatures due to the presence of an anti-Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum tree generator improves QAOA state-of-the-art for the knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), specifically tailored to the knapsack problem. We combine the recently proposed quantum tree generator as an efficient state preparation circuit for all feasible solutions to the knapsack problem with the framework of Grover-mixer QAOA to form the first representative of Amplitude Amplification-mixer QAOA (AAM-QAOA). On hard benchmark sets with up to 20 knapsack items, we demonstrate our method's improved performance over the current state-of-the-art Copula-QAOA. However, for larger instance sizes, both approaches fail to deliver better outcomes than greedily packing items in descending value-to-weight ratio, at least for the considered circuit depths. For sufficiently high circuit depths, however, we can prove that AAM-QAOA will eventually be able to sample the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Pauli Transfer Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of quantum processes, especially in the context of noise, errors, and decoherence is essential for the improvement of quantum devices. An intuitive representation of those processes modeled by quantum channels are Pauli transfer matrices. They display the action of a linear map in the $n$-qubit Pauli basis in a way, that is more intuitive, since Pauli strings are more tangible objects than the standard basis matrices. We set out to investigate classical algorithms that convert the various representations into Pauli transfer matrices. We propose new algorithms that make explicit use of the tensor product structure of the Pauli basis. They convert a quantum channel in a given representation (Chi or process matrix, Choi matrix, superoperator, or Kraus operators) to the corresponding Pauli transfer matrix. Moreover, the underlying principle can also be used to calculate the Pauli transfer matrix of other linear operations over $n$-qubit matrices such as left-, right-, and sandwich multiplication as well as forming the (anti-)commutator with a given operator. Finally, we investigate the runtime of these algorithms, derive their asymptotic scaling and demonstrate improved performance using instances with up to seven qubits.</description>

      <title>A General Quantum Duality for Representations of Groups with Applications to Quantum Money, Lightning, and Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind established that swapping quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is computationally equivalent to distinguishing their superpositions $|\psi\rangle\pm|\phi\rangle$. We extend this to a general duality principle: manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting values in a complementary basis. Formally, for any group, implementing a unitary representation is equivalent to Fourier subspace extraction from its irreducible representations.
  Building on this duality principle, we present the applications:
  * Quantum money, representing verifiable but unclonable quantum states, and its stronger variant, quantum lightning, have resisted secure plain-model constructions. While (public-key) quantum money has been constructed securely only from the strong assumption of quantum-secure iO, quantum lightning has lacked such a construction, with past attempts using broken assumptions. We present the first secure quantum lightning construction based on a plausible cryptographic assumption by extending Zhandry's construction from Abelian to non-Abelian group actions, eliminating reliance on a black-box model. Our construction is realizable with symmetric group actions, including those implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem.
  * We give an alternative quantum lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, with security holding under certain conditions. This scheme shows equivalence among four security notions: quantum lightning security, worst-case and average-case cloning security, and security against preparing a canonical state.
  * Quantum fire describes states that are clonable but not telegraphable: they cannot be efficiently encoded classically. These states "spread" like fire, but are viable only in coherent quantum form. The only prior construction required a unitary oracle; we propose the first candidate in the plain model.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced sensing of spin-orbit coupling without fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling plays an important role in both fundamental physics and technological applications. Precise estimation of the spin-orbit coupling is necessary for accurate designing across various physical setups such as solid state devices and quantum hardware. Here, we exploit quantum features in a 1D quantum wire for estimating the Rashba spin-orbit coupling with enhanced sensitivity beyond the capability of classical probes. The Heisenberg limited enhanced precision is achieved across a wide range of parameters and does not require fine tuning. Such advantage is directly related to the gap-closing nature of the probe across the entire relevant range of parameters. This provides clear advantage over conventional criticality-based quantum sensors in which quantum enhanced sensitivity can only be achieved through fine-tuning around the phase transition point. We have demonstrated quantum enhanced sensitivity for both single particle and interacting many-body probes. In addition to extending our results to thermal states and the multi-parameter scenario, we have provided an measurement basis to perform close to the ultimate precision.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable square-ladder cluster states in a microwave frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an experiment demonstrating the generation of three independent square-ladder continuous-variable cluster states with up to 94 qumodes of a microwave frequency comb. This entanglement structure at a large scale is realized by injecting vacuum fluctuations into a Josephson Parametric Amplifier pumped by three coherent signals around twice its resonance frequency, each having a particular well-defined phase relation. We reach up to 1.4 dB of squeezing of the nullifier which verifies the cluster state on the square ladder graph. Our results are consistent with a more familiar measure of two-mode squeezing, where we find up to 5.42 dB for one pump, and up to 1 dB for three pumps.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Discrete Time Crystals on Decorated Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-crystalline order in periodically driven quantum Ising models on disorder-free decorated lattices. Using a tensor network ansatz for the state which reflects the geometry of a unit cell of the lattice, we show through finite entanglement scaling that the system has an exponentially long-lived subharmonic response in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting discrete time crystal is not only stable to imperfections in the transverse field, but also exhibits a bipartite rigidity to generic perturbations in the longitudinal field. We call this state a bipartite discrete time crystal and reveal a rich prethermal phase diagram, including multiple regions of bipartite time-crystalline order, uniform time-crystalline order and thermalization, with boundaries depending delicately on the topology of the decorated lattice. Our results thus uncover a variety of time crystals which may be realized on current digital quantum processors and analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Intensity correlations in decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbour correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) promises simultaneous data queries at multiple memory locations, with data retrieved in coherent superpositions, essential for achieving quantum speedup in many quantum algorithms. We introduce a transmon-controlled phonon router and propose a QRAM implementation by connecting these routers in a tree-like architecture. The router controls the motion of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons based on the state of the control transmon, implementing the core functionality of conditional routing for QRAM. Our QRAM design is compact, supports fast routing operations, and avoids frequency crowding. Additionally, we propose a hybrid dual-rail encoding method to detect dominant loss errors without additional hardware, a versatile approach applicable to other QRAM platforms. Our estimates indicate that the proposed QRAM platform can achieve high heralding rates using current device parameters, with heralding fidelity primarily limited by transmon dephasing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems requires the inversion of a linear system of equations, which can be done using a quantum algorithm for matrix inversion arxiv:1806.01838. However, the number of shots required to measure the output of the system can be prohibitive and remove any advantage obtained by quantum computing. In this work we propose a scheme for measuring the output of QSVT matrix inversion algorithms specifically for the CFD use case. We use a Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) based amplitude estimation algorithm arxiv:2207.08628 and show how it can be combined with the QSVT matrix inversion algorithm. We perform a detailed resource estimation of the amount of computational resources required for a single iteration of amplitude estimation, and compare the costs of amplitude estimation with the cost of not doing amplitude estimation and measuring the whole wavefunction. We also propose a measurement scheme to reduce the number of amplitudes measured in the CFD example by focusing on large amplitudes only. We simulate the whole CFD loop, finding that thus measuring only a small number of the total amplitudes in the output vector still results in an acceptable level of overall error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum error correction codes can reshape the native noise profiles of quantum devices, explicitly considering trapped-ion systems. We analytically derive the quantum channels describing noisy two-qubit entangling gates, showing that the leading error term is the sum of single-qubit bit-flip errors. This motivates our choice of compatible quantum error correction code -- the bit-flip repetition code, based on which we add a parameterised single-qubit gate for extra tunability. We analytically derive the resulting logical quantum channel, illustrating the noise profile transformation. We then demonstrate the noise reshaping on the IonQ Aria-1 quantum hardware, where the data shows consistency with our analytical model. Our results represent first step towards using quantum error correction codes in genuine quantum ways, paving the way to exploiting the device native noise as features for open quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with local unitaries have emerged as a rich playground for the exploration of many-body quantum dynamics of discrete-time systems. While the intrinsic locality makes them particularly suited to run on current quantum processors, the task of verification at non-trivial scales is complicated for non-integrable systems. Here, we study a special class of maximally chaotic circuits known as dual unitary circuits -- exhibiting unitarity in both space and time -- that are known to have exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. With advances in noise learning and the implementation of novel error mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then probe dynamics beyond exact verification, by perturbing the circuits away from the dual unitary point, and compare our results to classical approximations with tensor networks. These results cement error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors as a trustworthy platform for the exploration and discovery of novel emergent quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum-like cognition with the neuronal networks within generalized probability theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent years are characterized by intensive applications of the methodology and mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, quantum-like modeling, in cognition, psychology, and decision making. In spite of the successful applications of this approach to a variety of psychological effects, e.g., the order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects, one may (but need not) feel dissatisfaction due to the absence of clear coupling to the neurophysiological processes in the brain. For the moment, this is just a phenomenological approach. In this paper we construct the quantum-like representation of the networks of communicating neurons. It is based not on standard quantum theory, but on generalized probability theory (GPT) with the emphasis of the operational measurement approach. We employ GPT's version which is based on ordered linear state space (instead of complex Hilbert space). A network of communicating neurons is described as a weighted ordered graph that in turn is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of weight matrices is embedded in GPT with effect-observables and state updates within measurement instruments theory. The latter plays the crucial role. This GPT based model shows the basic quantum-like effects, as e.g. the order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects; the latter is also known as interference of decisions. This GPT coupling also supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostic for neurological diseases, as depression and epilepsy. Although the paper is concentrated on cognition and neuronal networks, the formalism and methodology can be straightforwardly applied to a variety of biological and social networks.</description>

      <title>Fr\"ohlich versus Bose-Einstein Condensation in Pumped Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon-condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultra-low temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fr\"ohlich-condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. Here, we elucidate the essential features of magnon-condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein magnons dissipatively interact with a phonon bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected magnon occupations turns out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fr\"ohlich-condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations amplifying or diminishing the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation as opposed to traditional descriptions using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semi-classical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anti-correlations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.</description>

      <title>Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.</description>

      <title>In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>Efficient State Preparation for the Schwinger Model with a Theta Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison of different quantum state preparation algorithms and their overall efficiency for the Schwinger model with a theta term. While adiabatic state preparation (ASP) is proved to be effective, in practice it leads to large CNOT gate counts to prepare the ground state. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) provides excellent results while keeping the CNOT counts small by design, at the cost of an expensive classical minimization process. We introduce a ``blocked'' modification of the Schwinger Hamiltonian to be used in the QAOA that further decreases the length of the algorithms as the size of the problem is increased. The rodeo algorithm (RA) provides a powerful tool to efficiently prepare any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, as long as its overlap with the initial guess is large enough. We obtain the best results when combining the blocked QAOA ansatz and the RA, as this provides an excellent initial state with a relatively short algorithm without the need to perform any classical steps for large problem sizes.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological crystalline insulator under space-time inversion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants under space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The inversion winding number reliably captures a novel bulk-edge correspondence, where gapped edge states are related to the inversion winding number of the sandwiching bands. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally discern band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.</description>

      <title>From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Topological QBits in Flux-Quantized Super-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a brief exposition of our recent realization of anyonic quantum states on single M5-brane probes in 11D super-gravity backgrounds, by non-perturbative quantization of the topological sector of the self-dual tensor field on the 6D worldvolume, after its proper flux-quantization. This opens the prospect of holographic models for topological qbits away from the usual but unrealistic limit of large numbers of branes.
  At the same time, the elementary homotopy-theoretic nature of the construction yields a slick expression of topological quantum gates in homotopically-typed programming languages, opening the prospect of topological-hardware aware quantum programming.
  In view of these results, we end with some more meta-physical remarks on (cohesive) homotopy (type) theory in view of emergent fundamental physics and, possibly, M-theory.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Chern number: equivalence of real-space and twisted-boundary-condition formulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chern number is a crucial invariant for characterizing topological feature of two-dimensional quantum systems. Real-space Chern number allows us to extract topological properties of systems without involving translational symmetry, and hence plays an important role in investigating topological systems with disorder or impurity. On the other hand, the twisted boundary condition (TBC) can also be used to define the Chern number in the absence of translational symmetry. Based on the perturbative nature of the TBC under appropriate gauges, we derive the two real-space formulae of Chern number (namely the non-commutative Chern number and the Bott index formula), which are numerically confirmed for the Chern insulator and the quantum spin Hall insulator. Our results not only establish the equivalence between the real-space and TBC formula of the Chern number, but also provide concrete and instructive examples for deriving the real-space topological invariant through the twisted boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few decades, researchers have created a veritable zoo of quantum algorithm by drawing inspiration from classical computing, information theory, and even from physical phenomena. Here we present quantum algorithms for parallel-in-time simulations that are inspired by the Page and Wooters formalism. In this framework, and thus in our algorithms, the classical time-variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by introducing a Hilbert space of "clock" qubits which are then entangled with the "system" qubits. We show that our algorithms can compute temporal properties over $N$ different times of many-body systems by only using $\log(N)$ clock qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing an exponential advantage in computation times over traditional sequential in time algorithms. In particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry-Andre model, we present a hybrid method for which our algorithms have a depth that only scales as $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)n)$. As a by product we can relate the previous schemes to the problem of equilibration of an isolated quantum system, thus indicating that our framework enable a new dimension for studying dynamical properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry activation and its relation to coherence under permutation operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Dicke state and its decohered state are invariant for permutation. However, when another qubits state to each of them is attached, the whole state is not invariant for permutation, and has a certain asymmetry for permutation. The amount of asymmetry can be measured by the number of distinguishable states under the group action or the mutual information. Generally, the amount of asymmetry of the whole state is larger than the amount of asymmetry of the added state. That is, the asymmetry activation happens in this case. This paper investigates the amount of the asymmetry activation under Dicke states. To address the asymmetry activation asymptotically, we introduce a new type of central limit theorem by using several formulas on hypergeometric functions. We reveal that the amounts of the asymmetry and the asymmetry activation with a Dicke state have a strictly larger order than those with the decohered state in a specific type of the limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prepare-and-measure scenario is naturally described by a communication matrix that collects all conditional outcome probabilities of the scenario into a row-stochastic matrix. The set of all possible communication matrices is partially ordered via the possibility to transform one matrix to another by pre- and post-processings. By considering maximal elements in this preorder for a subset of matrices implementable in a given theory, it becomes possible to identify communication matrices of maximum utility, i.e., matrices that are not majorized by any other matrices in the theory. The identity matrix of an appropriate size is the greatest element in classical theories, while the maximal elements in quantum theory have remained unknown. We completely characterize the maximal elements in quantum theory, thereby revealing the essential structure of the set of quantum communication matrices. In particular, we show that the identity matrix is the only maximal element in quantum theory but, as opposed to a classical theory, it is not the greatest element. Quantum theory can hence be seen to be distinct from classical theory by the existence of incompatible communication matrices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonclassicality within quasi-distribution representations through deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unequivocally distinguish genuine quantumness from classicality, a widely adopted approach focuses on the negative values of a quasi-distribution representation as compelling evidence of nonclassicality. Prominent examples include the dynamical process nonclassicality characterized by the canonical Hamiltonian ensemble representation (CHER) and the nonclassicality of quantum states characterized by the Wigner function. However, to construct a multivariate joint quasi-distribution function with negative values from experimental data is typically highly cumbersome. Here we propose a computational approach utilizing a deep generative model, processing three marginals, to construct the bivariate joint quasi-distribution functions. We first apply our model to tackle the challenging problem of the CHERs, which lacks universal solutions, rendering the problem ground-truth (GT) deficient. To overcome the GT deficiency of the CHER problem, we design optimal synthetic datasets to train our model. While trained with synthetic data, the physics-informed optimization enables our model to capture the detrimental effect of the thermal fluctuations on nonclassicality, which cannot be obtained from any analytical solutions. This underscores the reliability of our approach. This approach also allows us to predict the Wigner functions subject to thermal noises. Our model predicts the Wigner functions with a prominent accuracy by processing three marginals of probability distributions. Our approach also provides a significant reduction of the experimental efforts of constructing the Wigner functions of quantum states, giving rise to an efficient alternative way to realize the quantum state tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplexed operations and extended coherent control over multiple trapping sites are fundamental requirements for a trapped-ion processor in a large scale architecture. Here we demonstrate these building blocks using a surface-electrode trap with integrated photonic components which are scalable to larger numbers of zones. We implement a Ramsey sequence using the integrated light in two zones, separated by 375 $\mu$m, performing transport of the ion from one zone to the other in 200 $\mu$s between pulses. In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we developed techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk, and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multi-zone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion QCCD architecture.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a quantum processor based on a 3D linear Paul trap that uses $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions with 8 individually controllable four-level qudits (ququarts), which is computationally equivalent to a 16-qubit quantum processor. The design of the developed ion trap provides high secular frequencies, low heating rate, which, together with individual addressing and readout optical systems, allows executing quantum algorithms. In each of the 8 ions, we use four electronic levels coupled by E2 optical transition at 435 nm for qudit encoding. We present the results of single- and two-qubit operations benchmarking and realizing basic quantum algorithms, including Bernstein-Vazirani and Grover's search algorithms as well as H$_2$ and LiH molecular simulations. Our results pave the way to scalable qudit-based quantum processors using trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Efficient unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries from permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we give an efficient construction of unitary $k$-designs using $\tilde{O}(k\cdot poly(n))$ quantum gates, as well as an efficient construction of a parallel-secure pseudorandom unitary (PRU). Both results are obtained by giving an efficient quantum algorithm that lifts random permutations over $S(N)$ to random unitaries over $U(N)$ for $N=2^n$. In particular, we show that products of exponentiated sums of $S(N)$ permutations with random phases approximately match the first $2^{\Omega(n)}$ moments of the Haar measure. By substituting either $\tilde{O}(k)$-wise independent permutations, or quantum-secure pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) in place of the random permutations, we obtain the above results. The heart of our proof is a conceptual connection between the large dimension (large-$N$) expansion in random matrix theory and the polynomial method, which allows us to prove query lower bounds at finite-$N$ by interpolating from the much simpler large-$N$ limit. The key technical step is to exhibit an orthonormal basis for irreducible representations of the partition algebra that has a low-degree large-$N$ expansion. This allows us to show that the distinguishing probability is a low-degree rational polynomial of the dimension $N$.</description>

      <title>Classical Post-processing for Unitary Block Optimization Scheme to Reduce the Effect of Noise on Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new quantum circuit synthesis (QCS) framework, Qsyn, for developers to research, develop, test, experiment, and then contribute their QCS algorithms and tools to the framework. Our framework is more developer-friendly than other modern QCS frameworks in three aspects: (1) We design a rich command-line interface so that developers can easily design various testing scenarios and flexibly conduct experiments on their algorithms. (2) We offer detailed access to many data representations on different abstract levels of quantum circuits so that developers can optimize their algorithms to the extreme. (3) We define a rigid developing flow and environment so that developers can ensure their development qualities with the best modern software engineering practices. We illustrate the friendliness of our framework with a showcase of developing a T-Count Optimization algorithm and demonstrate our performance superiority with fair comparisons to other modern QCS frameworks.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-hermitian Chebyshev differential matrix and non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral collocation method (SCM) exhibits a clear superiority in solving ordinary and partial differential equations compared to conventional techniques, such as finite difference and finite element methods. This makes SCM a powerful tool for addressing the Schr\"odinger-like equations with boundary conditions in physics. However, the Chebyshev differential matrix (CDM), commonly used in SCM to replace the differential operator, is not Hermitian but pseudo-Hermitian. This non-Hermiticity subtly affects the pseudospectra and leads to a loss of completeness in the eigenstates. Consequently, several issues arise with these eigenstates. In this paper, we revisit the non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics by emphasizing the pseudo-Hermiticity of the CDM and explore its expanded models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectral instability can be influenced by the compactification parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributing quantum states reliably among distant locations is a key challenge in the field of quantum networks. One-way quantum networks address this by using one-way communication and quantum error correction. Here, we analyze quantum circuit switching as a protocol to distribute quantum states in one-way quantum networks. In quantum circuit switching, pairs of users can request the delivery of multiple quantum states from one user to the other. After waiting for approval from the network, the states can be distributed either sequentially, forwarding one at a time along a path of quantum repeaters, or in parallel, sending batches of quantum states from repeater to repeater. Since repeaters can only forward a finite number of quantum states at a time, a pivotal question arises: is it advantageous to send them sequentially (allowing for multiple requests simultaneously) or in parallel (reducing processing time but handling only one request at a time)? We compare both approaches in a quantum network with a star topology. Using tools from queuing theory, we show that requests are met at a higher rate when packets are distributed in parallel, although sequential distribution can generally provide service to a larger number of users simultaneously. We also show that using a large number of quantum repeaters to combat channel losses limits the maximum distance between users, as each repeater introduces additional processing delays. These findings provide insight into the design of protocols for distributing quantum states in one-way quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the graphical representation of two-qubit entanglement on two Bloch Spheres via stabilizer formalism. We relate the density matrix to the graphical representation on two Bloch Spheres by showing how both may be derived from the stabilizer group structure of the state. Then we use the representation to explore the symmetries present in maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>Improved QLDPC Surgery: Logical Measurements and Bridging Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gauge-fixed QLDPC surgery scheme, an improved logical measurement scheme based on the construction of Cohen et al.~(Sci.~Adv.~8, eabn1717). Our scheme leverages expansion properties of the Tanner graph to substantially reduce the space overhead of QLDPC surgery. In certain cases, we only require $\Theta(w)$ ancilla qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight $w$ logical operator. We provide rigorous analysis for the code distance and fault distance of our schemes, and present a modular decoding algorithm that achieves maximal fault-distance. We further introduce a bridge system to facilitate fault-tolerant joint measurements of logical operators. Augmented by this bridge construction, our scheme can be used to connect different families of QLDPC codes into one universal architecture.
  Applying our toolbox, we show how to perform all logical Clifford gates on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code. Our scheme adds 103 ancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical qubits is used as an ancilla for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with the automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al.~(Nature 627, 778-782) to implement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging our proposed modular decoder that combines BPOSD with matching.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy and capacity optimization in Heisenberg spin-chain quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the performance of finite spin quantum batteries (QBs) using Heisenberg spin models with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan--Shekhtman--Entin-Wohlman--Aharony (KSEA) interactions. The QBs are modeled as interacting quantum spins in local inhomogeneous magnetic fields, inducing variable Zeeman splitting. We derive analytical expressions for the maximal extractable work, ergotropy and the capacity of QBs, as recently examined by Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 030402 (2023)]. These quantities are analytically linked through certain quantum correlations, as posited in the aforementioned study. Different Heisenberg spin chain models exhibit distinct behaviors under varying conditions, emphasizing the importance of model selection for optimizing QB performance. In antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems, maximum ergotropy occurs with a Zeeman splitting field applied to either spin, while ferromagnetic (FM) systems benefit from a uniform Zeeman field. Temperature significantly impacts QB performance, with ergotropy in the AFM case being generally more robust against temperature increases compared to the FM case. Incorporating DM and KSEA couplings can significantly enhance the capacity and ergotropy extraction of QBs. However, there exists a threshold beyond which additional increases in these interactions cause a sharp decline in capacity and ergotropy. This behavior is influenced by temperature and quantum coherence, which signal the occurrence of a sudden phase transition. The resource theory of quantum coherence proposed by Baumgratz et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)] plays a crucial role in enhancing ergotropy and capacity. However, ergotropy is limited by both the system's capacity and the amount of coherence. These findings support the theoretical framework of spin-based QBs and may benefit future research on quantum energy storage devices.</description>

Abstract: Magic is the quantum resource allowing a quantum computer to perform operations that cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computation. As such, generating magic in a quantum system is crucial for achieving quantum advantage. This letter shows that magic can be harvested by a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector (a qutrit) interacting with a quantum field in an initial vacuum state. While the idea of extracting resources from Quantum Field Theories (QFT) was born from the harvesting of entanglement, our result extends the protocol to evolve a qutrit from a non-magical state to a magical one, making it possible to generate magic from QFT.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Characterization of Quantum Advantage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computational advantage refers to an existence of computational tasks that are easy for quantum computing but hard for classical one. Unconditionally showing quantum advantage is beyond our current understanding of complexity theory, and therefore some computational assumptions are needed. Which complexity assumption is necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage? In this paper, we show that inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist if and only if classically-secure one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist. As far as we know, this is the first time that a complete cryptographic characterization of quantum advantage is obtained. IV-PoQ capture various types of quantum advantage previously studied, such as sampling-based quantum advantage and searching-based one. Previous work [Morimae and Yamakawa, Crypto 2024] showed that IV-PoQ can be constructed from OWFs, but a construction of IV-PoQ from weaker assumptions was left open. Our result solves the open problem. OWPuzzs are one of the most fundamental quantum cryptographic primitives implied by many quantum cryptographic primitives weaker than one-way functions (OWFs). The equivalence between IV-PoQ and classically-secure OWPuzzs therefore highlights that if there is no quantum advantage, then these fundamental primitives do not exist. The equivalence also means that quantum advantage is an example of the applications of OWPuzzs. Except for commitments, no application of OWPuzzs was known before. Our result shows that quantum advantage is another application of OWPuzzs, which solves the open question of [Chung, Goldin, and Gray, Crypto 2024]. Moreover, it is the first quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) application of OWPuzzs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a unitary quantum oracle relative to which quantum commitments exist but no (efficiently verifiable) one-way state generators exist. Both have been widely considered candidates for replacing one-way functions as the minimal assumption for cryptography: the weakest cryptographic assumption implied by all of computational cryptography. Recent work has shown that commitments can be constructed from one-way state generators, but the other direction has remained open. Our results rule out any black-box construction, and thus settle this crucial open problem, suggesting that quantum commitments (as well as its equivalency class of EFI pairs, quantum oblivious transfer, and secure quantum multiparty computation) appear to be strictly weakest among all known cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>Assessing non-Gaussian quantum state conversion with the stellar rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State conversion is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. Quantum resource theories allow to analyze and bound conversions that use restricted sets of operations. In the context of continuous-variable systems, state conversions restricted to Gaussian operations are crucial for both fundamental and practical reasons -- particularly in state preparation and quantum computing with bosonic codes. However, previous analysis did not consider the relevant case of approximate state conversion. In this work, we introduce a framework for assessing approximate Gaussian state conversion by extending the stellar rank to the approximate stellar rank, which serves as an operational measure of non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds for Gaussian state conversion under both approximate and probabilistic conditions, yielding new no-go results for non-Gaussian state preparation and enabling a reliable assessment of the performance of generic Gaussian conversion protocols.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient compilation method for distributed quantum computing (DQC) using the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) architecture. By exploiting the LNN topology's symmetry, we optimize quantum circuit compilation for High Local Connectivity, Sparse Full Connectivity (HLC-SFC) algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). We also utilize dangling qubits to minimize non-local interactions and reduce SWAP gates. Our approach significantly decreases compilation time, gate count, and circuit depth, improving scalability and robustness for large-scale quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Localization Transitions in a Topological Anderson Insulator: A Study of a Generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology and localization properties of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with a quasi-periodic modulated hopping. It is found that the interplay of off-diagonal quasi-periodic modulations can induce topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases and reentrant topological Anderson insulator (RTAI), and the topological phase boundaries can be uncovered by the divergence of the localization length of the zero-energy mode. In contrast to the conventional case that the TAI regime emerges in a finite range with the increase of disorder, the TAI and RTAI are robust against arbitrary modulation amplitude for our system. Furthermore, we find that the TAI and RTAI can induce the emergence of reentrant localization transitions. Such an interesting connection between the reentrant localization transition and the TAI/RTAI can be detected from the wave-packet dynamics in cold atom systems by adopting the technique of momentum-lattice engineering.</description>

In particular, making use of the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can be axially confined and engineered using a trapped {\em control} dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic patterns in the target condensate. The latter leads to a structural transition between single and double-peaked structures with coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control condensates.</description>

Abstract: The spin-reversal in dilute Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N with $x &lt; 1$ % is dominated by resonant quantum tunneling of spatially well-separated states. We report on the effect of finite couplings between those states that give rise to cooperative, simultaneous quantum tunneling of two spins. This phenomenon, known as spin-spin cross relaxation, effectively elucidates the fine-structure observed in isothermal magnetization loops, a previously unresolved aspect. Temperature and field-dependent magnetization measurements were conducted over a range from T = 2 K to 300 K in applied fields of up to $\mu_0H$ = 7 T. Magnetic dipole fields are computed numerically. Our findings affirm the absence of stoichiometric defects in Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N and underscore its exemplary suitability as a model system for investigating spin-reversal processes at the microscopic level. This is attributed to its comparatively simple crystal structure, the availability of large single crystals, elevated characteristic energies, and well-defined energy levels</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory starting from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results, like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a straightforward polynomial expansion.</description>

Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.</description>

      <title>QuanTA: Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Quantum-Informed Tensor Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Quantum-informed Tensor Adaptation (QuanTA), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient high-rank fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)--low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino can be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>
