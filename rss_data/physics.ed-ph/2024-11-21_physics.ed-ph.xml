      <title>A Systematic Review of Empirical Research on Graphing Numerical Data in K-12 STEM Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are essential representations in the professions and education concerning the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Beyond their academic relevance, graphs find extensive utility in everyday scenarios, ranging from news media to educational materials. This underscores the importance of people's being able to understand graphs. However, the ability to understand graphs is connected to the ability to create graphs. Therefore, in school education, particularly in STEM subjects, not only the understanding but also the skill of constructing graphs from numerical data is emphasized. Although constructing graphs is a skill that most people do not require in their everyday lives and professions, it is a well-established student activity that has been empirically studied several times. Therefore, since a synthesis of the research findings on this topic has not yet been conducted, a summary of the studies investigating graphing via various viewpoints and differing methods could be a valuable contribution. To provide an overview of the empirical literature on this important topic, our systematic review identifies how the construction of convention-based graphical representations of numerical data, referred to as graphing, has been studied in previous research, how effective graphing is, and which types of difficulties are encountered by students. Based on these aspects, we defined inclusion criteria that led to 50 peer-reviewed empirical studies on graphing in K-12 STEM education found in SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsychInfo. Graphing instruction seemed to be beneficial for student learning, not only improving graph construction but also graph interpretation skills. However, the students experienced various difficulties during graphing, both during graph construction and the interpretation and usage of data.</description>

      <title>Recitation tasks revamped? Evaluation of smartphone experiment tasks in introductory mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an approach to integrate innovative forms of recitation tasks into first-year introductory mechanics, with a primary focus on smartphone-based experimental tasks and additional programming tasks for comparison. Smartphones enable inexpensive physics experiments with digitized first-hand data collection outside lab settings. Such student experiments can enhance homework assignments, breaking down barriers between lectures, recitation groups, and labs, and thereby linking theoretical and experimental aspects of undergraduate physics education. To explore this potential, we implemented and evaluated a sample set of nine smartphone-based experimental tasks and three programming tasks as weekly exercises in a first-year physics course at RWTH Aachen University. Through twelve short surveys involving up to 188 participants, we investigated students' perceptions of learning with the new tasks, focusing on factors such as goal clarity, difficulty, or feasibility at home. In two additional surveys with 108 and 78 participants, students compared the new experimental and programming tasks to each other and to standard recitation tasks based on affective variables. Our findings indicate that the smartphone-based experimental tasks were generally well-suited to the students, which tended to outperform the programming tasks in terms of perceptions of learning with the tasks and affective responses. Overall, students responded positively to the new experimental tasks, with perceptions comparable to, or only partly below those of established standard recitation tasks. Given that most of the experimental tasks were newly implemented "on-the-fly" within a running course, while the standard recitation tasks have been refined over years, these results are encouraging. They suggest that smartphone-based experimental tasks can be successfully integrated into teaching.</description>

      <title>Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator: a pedagogical approach via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics courses, students often solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the harmonic oscillator with time-independent parameters. However, time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillators (TDHOs) are relevant in modeling several problems as, for instance, the description of quantum motion of particles in traps, in shortcuts to adiabaticity, as well as in quantum scalar fields evolving in expanding universes. In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the TDHO with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relationship between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of pedagogical applications of TDHOs and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a TDHO which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.</description>

      <title>Names from Greek Myth in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Greek mythology supplies fundamental physics with the names of numerous (100+) experiments, machines, codes, and phenomena. I present the central narrative of Greek mythos via these names. Hyperlinks are provided for their physics counterparts, and the names are collected in myth- and physics-themed indices.</description>
