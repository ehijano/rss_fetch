      <title>Anonymity and strategy-proofness on a domain of single-peaked and single-dipped preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of locating a public facility on a line in a society where agents have either single-peaked or single-dipped preferences. We consider the domain analyzed in Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024), where the type of preference of each agent is public information, but the location of her peak/dip as well as the rest of the preference are unknown. We characterize all strategy-proof and type-anonymous rules on this domain. Building on existing results, we provide a two-step characterization": first, the median between the peaks and a collection of fixed values is computed (Moulin, 1980), resulting in either a single alternative or a pair of contiguous alternatives. If the outcome of the median is a pair, we apply a double-quota majority method" in the second step to choose between the two alternatives in the pair (Moulin, 1983). We also show the additional conditions that type-anonymity imposes on the strategy-proof rules characterized by Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024). Finally, we show the equivalence between the two characterizations.</description>

      <title>Proportionality in Multiple Dimensions to Design Electoral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to elect the representatives in legislative bodies is a question that every modern democracy has to answer. This design task has to consider various elements so as to fulfill the citizens' expectations and contribute to the maintenance of a healthy democracy. The notion of proportionality, in that the support of a given idea in the house should be nearly proportional to its support in the general public, lies at the core of this design task. In the last decades, demographic aspects beyond political support have been incorporated by requiring that they are also fairly represented in the body, giving rise to a multidimensional version of the apportionment problem. In this work, we provide an axiomatic justification for a recently proposed notion of multidimensional proportionality and extend it to encompass two relevant constraints often used in electoral systems: a threshold on the number of votes that a list needs in order to be eligible and the election of the most-voted candidate in each district. We then build upon these results to design methods based on multidimensional proportionality. We use the Chilean Constitutional Convention election (May 15-16, 2021) results as a testing ground -- where the dimensions are given by political lists, districts, and genders -- and compare the apportionment obtained under each method according to three criteria: proportionality, representativeness, and voting power. While local and global methods exhibit a natural trade-off between local and global proportionality, including the election of most-voted candidates on top of methods based on 3-dimensional proportionality allows us to incorporate both notions while ensuring higher levels of representativeness and a balanced voting power.</description>

      <title>Selling to a principal and a budget-constrained agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a model of selling a single object to a principal-agent pair who want to acquire the object for a firm. The principal and the agent have different assessments of the object's value to the firm. The agent is budget-constrained while the principal is not. The agent participates in the mechanism, but she can (strategically) delegate decision-making to the principal. We derive the revenue-maximizing mechanism in a two-dimensional type space (values of the agent and the principal). We show that below a threshold budget, a mechanism involving two posted prices and three outcomes (one of which involves randomization) is the optimal mechanism for the seller. Otherwise, a single posted price mechanism is optimal.</description>

      <title>Balancing Selection Efficiency and Societal Costs in Selective Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective contests can impair participants' overall welfare in overcompetitive environments, such as school admissions. This paper models the situation as an optimal contest design problem with binary actions, treating effort costs as societal costs incurred to achieve a desired level of selectivity. We provide a characterization for the feasible set of selection efficiency and societal cost in selective contests by establishing their relationship with feasible equilibrium strategies. We find that selection efficiency and contestants' welfare are complementary, i.e. it is almost impossible to improve one without sacrificing the other. We derive the optimal equilibrium outcome given the feasible set and characterize the corresponding optimal contest design. Our analysis demonstrates that it is always optimal for a contest designer who is sufficiently concerned with societal cost to intentionally introduce randomness into the contest. Furthermore, we show that the designer can optimize any linear payoff function by adjusting a single parameter related to the intensity of randomness, without altering the specific structure of the contest.</description>
