      <title>Bounding the $K(p-1)$-local exotic Picard group at $p&gt;3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the descent filtration of the exotic Picard group $\kappa_n$, for a prime number $p&gt;3$ and $n=p-1$. Our method involves a detailed comparison of the Picard spectral sequence, the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, and an auxiliary $\beta$-inverted homotopy fixed point spectral sequence whose input is the Farrell-Tate cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group. Along the way, we deduce that the $K(n)$-local Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for the sphere has a horizontal vanishing line at $3n^2+1$ on the $E_{2n^2+2}$-page.
  The same analysis also allows us to express the exotic Picard group of $K(n)$-local modules over the homotopy fixed points spectrum $\mathrm{E}_n^{hN}$, where $N$ is the normalizer in $\mathbb{G}_n$ of a finite cyclic subgroup of order $p$, as a subquotient of a single continuous cohomology group $H^{2n+1}(N,\pi_{2n}\mathrm{E}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry and is generalised to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra, using a non-commutative analogue of a flat connection.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Split-Decomposable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split-metric decompositions are an important tool in the theory of phylogenetics, particularly because of the link between the tight span and the class of totally decomposable spaces, a generalization of metric trees whose decomposition does not have a ``prime'' component. We use this connection to study the Vietoris-Rips complexes of totally decomposable spaces. In particular, we characterize the homotopy type of the Vietoris-Rips complex of circular decomposable spaces whose metric is monotone. We extend this result to compute the homology of certain non-monotone circular decomposable spaces. We also use the block decomposition of the tight span of a totally decomposable metric to induce a decomposition of the VR complex of a totally decomposable metric.</description>

      <title>Crossed modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an overview of the idea of a crossed module. For a group, the triple that consists of the group, its group of automorphisms, and the canonical homomorphism from the group to its group of automorphisms constitutes a crossed module. Crossed modules arise from the identities among the relations of the presentation of a group, from the extension problem for groups and, more generally, in low dimensional topology. Also, the (successful) attempt to extend the idea of a normal extension of commutative fields to the realm of non-commutative algebras leads to crossed modules. Crossed modules appear implicitly in a forgotten paper by A. Turing which in principle settles the extension problem for groups. Crossed modules make perfect sense for Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: We discuss variants of Berikashvili's functor that arise in differential homological algebra, from simplicial bundles, from ordinary topological bundles, and in more general categorical settings. We prove that, under suitable circumstances, the value of Berikasvili's functor parametrizes isomorphism classes of bundles in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Term rewriting on nestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define term rewriting systems on the vertices and faces of nestohedra, and show that the former are confluent and terminating. While the associated poset on vertices generalizes Barnard--McConville's flip order for graph-associahedra, the preorder on faces likely generalizes the facial weak order for permutahedra. Moreover, we define and study contextual families of nestohedra, whose local confluence diagrams satisfy a certain uniformity condition. Among them are associahedra and operahedra, whose associated proofs of confluence for their rewriting systems reproduce proofs of categorical coherence theorems for monoidal categories and categorified operads.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>On the stable cohomology of the IA-automorphism groups of free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13458v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Borel's stability and vanishing theorem gives the stable cohomology of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$ with coefficients in algebraic $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$-representations. By combining the Borel theorem with the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, we compute the twisted first cohomology of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ of the free group $F_n$ of rank $n$. We also study the stable rational cohomology of the IA-automorphism group $\mathrm{IA}_n$ of $F_n$. We propose a conjectural algebraic structure of the stable rational cohomology of $\mathrm{IA}_n$, and consider some relations to known results and conjectures. We also consider a conjectural structure of the stable rational cohomology of the Torelli groups of surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss certain circumstances in which the category of tame functors inherits an abelian category structure with minimal resolutions and a model category structure with minimal cofibrant replacements. We also present a structure theorem for cofibrant objects in the category of tame functors indexed by realizations of posets of dimension $1$ with values in the category of chain complexes in an abelian category whose all objects are projectives. Moreover, we introduce a general technique to generate indecomposable objects in the abelian category of functors indexed by finite posets.</description>

      <title>Soft random simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Computational Synthetic Cohomology Theory in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the development of synthetic cohomology in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), as well as its computer formalisation. The objectives of this paper are (1) to generalise previous work on integral cohomology in HoTT by the current authors and Brunerie (2022) to cohomology with arbitrary coefficients and (2) to provide the mathematical details of, as well as extend, results underpinning the computer formalisation of cohomology rings by the current authors and Lamiaux (2023). With respect to objective (1), we provide new direct definitions of the cohomology group operations and of the cup product, which, just as in (Brunerie et al., 2022), enable significant simplifications of many earlier proofs in synthetic cohomology theory. In particular, the new definition of the cup product allows us to give the first complete formalisation of the axioms needed to turn the cohomology groups into a graded commutative ring. We also establish that this cohomology theory satisfies the HoTT formulation of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for cohomology and study the classical Mayer-Vietoris and Gysin sequences. With respect to objective (2), we characterise the cohomology groups and rings of various spaces, including the spheres, torus, Klein bottle, real/complex projective planes, and infinite real projective space. All results have been formalised in Cubical Agda and we obtain multiple new numbers, similar to the famous `Brunerie number', which can be used as benchmarks for computational implementations of HoTT. Some of these numbers are infeasible to compute in Cubical Agda and hence provide new computational challenges and open problems which are much easier to define than the original Brunerie number.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the higher analogues of contiguity distance and its relations with simplicial Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and discrete topological complexity. Also we study the effects of geometric realisation and barycentric subdivision in the sense that how the geometric realisation of the simplicial maps and the induced simplicial maps on barycentric subdivisions affects higher contiguity distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Gromov's notion of ideal-valued measures to symplectic topology, and use it for proving new results on symplectic rigidity and symplectic intersections. Furthermore, it enables us to discuss three "big fiber theorems", the Centerpoint Theorem in combinatorial geometry, the Maximal Fiber Inequality in topology, and the Non-displaceable Fiber Theorem in symplectic topology, from a unified viewpoint. Our main technical tool is an enhancement of the symplectic cohomology theory recently developed by Varolgunes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using geometric arguments, we compute the group of homotopy classes of maps from a closed $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold to the $n$-sphere for $n \geq 3$. Our work extends results from Kirby, Melvin and Teichner for closed oriented 4-manifolds and from Konstantis for closed $(n+1)$-dimensional spin manifolds, considering possibly non-orientable and non-spinnable manifolds. In the process, we introduce two types of manifolds that generalize the notion of odd and even 4-manifolds. Furthermore, for the case that $n \geq 4$, we discuss applications for rank $n$ spin vector bundles and obtain a refinement of the Euler class in the cohomotopy group that fully obstructs the existence of a non-vanishing section.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology and topological statistics of hyperuniform point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, is observed across a wide variety of domains, from cosmology to condensed matter and biological systems. Although the standard definition of hyperuniformity only utilizes information at the largest scales, hyperuniform configurations have distinctive local characteristics. However, the influence of global hyperuniformity on local structure has remained largely unexplored; establishing this connection can help uncover long-range interaction mechanisms and detect hyperuniform traits in finite-size systems. Here, we study the topological properties of hyperuniform point clouds by characterizing their persistent homology and the statistics of local graph neighborhoods. We find that varying the structure factor results in configurations with systematically different topological properties. Moreover, these topological properties are conserved for subsets of hyperuniform point clouds, establishing a connection between finite-sized systems and idealized reference arrangements. Comparing distributions of local topological neighborhoods reveals that the hyperuniform arrangements lie along a primarily one-dimensional manifold reflecting an order-to-disorder transition via hyperuniform configurations. The results presented here complement existing characterizations of hyperuniform phases of matter, and they show how local topological features can be used to detect hyperuniformity in size-limited simulations and experiments.</description>
