      <title>Ore extensions of multiplier Hopf coquasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Ore extensions of multiplier Hopf coquasigroups are studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the Ore extension of a multiplier Hopf coquasigroup to be a multiplier Hopf coquasigroup are given. Then the isomorphism between two Ore extensions is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We consider an equivalence relation $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$. In the main result, we show that the relation $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by {\em an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism}. Thus, our main result describes the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides its possible relevance in symbolic dynamics, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Framization and Deframization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and singly-generated torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>
