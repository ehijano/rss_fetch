      <title>WVSC: Wireless Video Semantic Communication with Multi-frame Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework, abbreviated as WVSC, which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video transmission scenarios. WVSC first encodes original video frames as semantic frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations, enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding methods. At the receiver, multi-frame compensation (MFC) is proposed to produce compensated current semantic frame with a multi-frame fusion attention module. With both the reference frame transmission and MFC, the bandwidth efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance. Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC over other DL-based methods e.g. DVSC about 1 dB and traditional schemes about 2 dB in terms of PSNR.</description>

      <title>FinAudio: A Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</description>

      <title>ZJUKLAB at SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning via Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/unlearn/tree/main/semeval25.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Evolution: Multi-Round Learning Between Large and Small Language Models for Emergent Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has exerted a substantial influence on society, leading to discernible impacts and deleterious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from the necessity for extensive supervised training and the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving circumstances. Large language models (LLMs), despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, have fallen short in effectively identifying fake news due to a lack of pertinent demonstrations and the dynamic nature of knowledge. In this paper, a novel framework Multi-Round Collaboration Detection (MRCD) is proposed to address these aforementioned limitations. The MRCD framework is capable of enjoying the merits from both LLMs and SLMs by integrating their generalization abilities and specialized functionalities, respectively. Our approach features a two-stage retrieval module that selects relevant and up-to-date demonstrations and knowledge, enhancing in-context learning for better detection of emerging news events. We further design a multi-round learning framework to ensure more reliable detection results. Our framework MRCD achieves SOTA results on two real-world datasets Pheme and Twitter16, with accuracy improvements of 7.4\% and 12.8\% compared to using only SLMs, which effectively addresses the limitations of current models and improves the detection of emergent fake news.</description>

      <title>Clean Image May be Dangerous: Data Poisoning Attacks Against Deep Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale image retrieval using deep hashing has become increasingly popular due to the exponential growth of image data and the remarkable feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, deep hashing methods are vulnerable to malicious attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks typically involve altering the query images, which is not a practical concern in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we point out that even clean query images can be dangerous, inducing malicious target retrieval results, like undesired or illegal images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study data \textbf{p}oisoning \textbf{a}ttacks against \textbf{d}eep \textbf{hash}ing \textbf{(\textit{PADHASH})}. Specifically, we first train a surrogate model to simulate the behavior of the target deep hashing model. Then, a strict gradient matching strategy is proposed to generate the poisoned images. Extensive experiments on different models, datasets, hash methods, and hash code lengths demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our attack method.</description>

      <title>Vision-to-Music Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-to-music Generation, including video-to-music and image-to-music tasks, is a significant branch of multimodal artificial intelligence demonstrating vast application prospects in fields such as film scoring, short video creation, and dance music synthesis. However, compared to the rapid development of modalities like text and images, research in vision-to-music is still in its preliminary stage due to its complex internal structure and the difficulty of modeling dynamic relationships with video. Existing surveys focus on general music generation without comprehensive discussion on vision-to-music. In this paper, we systematically review the research progress in the field of vision-to-music generation. We first analyze the technical characteristics and core challenges for three input types: general videos, human movement videos, and images, as well as two output types of symbolic music and audio music. We then summarize the existing methodologies on vision-to-music generation from the architecture perspective. A detailed review of common datasets and evaluation metrics is provided. Finally, we discuss current challenges and promising directions for future research. We hope our survey can inspire further innovation in vision-to-music generation and the broader field of multimodal generation in academic research and industrial applications. To follow latest works and foster further innovation in this field, we are continuously maintaining a GitHub repository at https://github.com/wzk1015/Awesome-Vision-to-Music-Generation.</description>

      <title>A Low-Power Streaming Speech Enhancement Accelerator For Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based speech enhancement models yield impressive results. However, their heterogeneous and complex structure restricts model compression potential, resulting in greater complexity and reduced hardware efficiency. Additionally, these models are not tailored for streaming and low-power applications. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a low-power streaming speech enhancement accelerator through model and hardware optimization. The proposed high performance model is optimized for hardware execution with the co-design of model compression and target application, which reduces 93.9\% of model size by the proposed domain-aware and streaming-aware pruning techniques. The required latency is further reduced with batch normalization-based transformers. Additionally, we employed softmax-free attention, complemented by an extra batch normalization, facilitating simpler hardware design. The tailored hardware accommodates these diverse computing patterns by breaking them down into element-wise multiplication and accumulation (MAC). This is achieved through a 1-D processing array, utilizing configurable SRAM addressing, thereby minimizing hardware complexities and simplifying zero skipping. Using the TSMC 40nm CMOS process, the final implementation requires merely 207.8K gates and 53.75KB SRAM. It consumes only 8.08 mW for real-time inference at a 62.5MHz frequency.</description>

      <title>VIA: Unified Spatiotemporal Video Adaptation Framework for Global and Local Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video editing serves as a fundamental pillar of digital media, spanning applications in entertainment, education, and professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal Video Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, we designed test-time editing adaptation to adapt a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that recursively gather consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potential for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</description>

      <title>Towards Controllable Speech Synthesis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. In addition, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of datasets and evaluation metrics and shed some light on the applications and future directions of controllable TTS. To the best of our knowledge, this survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of emerging controllable TTS methods, which can serve as a beneficial resource for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners.</description>
