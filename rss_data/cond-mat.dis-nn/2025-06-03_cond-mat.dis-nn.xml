      <title>Dynamical Properties of Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense associative memory is one of the basic modern Hopfield networks and can store large numbers of memory patterns. While the stationary state storage capacity has been investigated so far, its dynamical properties have not been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics by means of an exact approach based on generating functional analysis. It allows us to investigate convergence properties as well as the size of the attraction basins. We also analyze the stationary state of the updating rule.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Space Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity for every eligible particle at every vertex. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops at the moment when every vertex gets occupied by a single particle. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $d-$dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-assisted Monte Carlo sampling trained by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling problems are widely regarded as the task for which quantum computers can most readily provide a quantum advantage. Leveraging this feature, the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo [Layden, D. et al., Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] has been proposed recently, where sampling from a quantum computer is used as a proposal distribution and convergence to a target distribution is accelerated. However, guaranteeing convergence to the target distribution typically forces one to impose restrictive symmetry constraints on the quantum circuit, which makes it hard to design good proposal distributions and prevents making full use of the advantage of a quantum computer. We explore a hybrid quantum-classical MCMC framework that combines a quantum circuit with a generative neural sampler (GNS). The GNS is trained on quantum samples and acts as a classical surrogate to efficiently emulate quantum outputs, thereby lifting circuit constraints. We apply this method to Boltzmann sampling of spin glasses using proposals trained with a QAOA circuit. This approach outperforms conventional methods, showing a $\sim$100$\times$ improvement in spectral gap over uniform proposals. Notably, it maintains similar acceleration even without parameter optimization. These results establish the method as a viable sampling-based quantum algorithm for NISQ devices and highlight its potential for solving practical problems with quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in modern attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \sk wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the SineKAN model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state ans\"atze, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFCN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining dynamics to maximize irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many far-from-equilibrium biological systems, energy injected by irreversible processes at microscopic scales propagates to larger scales to fulfill important biological functions. But given dissipative dynamics at the microscale, how much irreversibility can persist at the macroscale? Here, we propose a model-free coarse-graining procedure that merges microscopic states to minimize the amount of lost irreversibility. Beginning with dynamical measurements, this procedure produces coarse-grained dynamics that retain as much information as possible about the underlying irreversibility. In synthetic and experimental data spanning molecular motors, biochemical oscillators, and recordings of neural activity, we derive simplified descriptions that capture the essential nonequilibrium processes. These results provide the tools to study the fundamental limits on the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations in the $SU(3)$ triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model at finite doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation platforms have become powerful tools for investigating strongly correlated systems beyond the capabilities of classical computation. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms and molecules now enable experimental realizations of SU(N)-symmetric Fermi-Hubbard models, yet theoretical understanding of these systems, particularly at finite doping remains limited. Here we investigate the strong-coupling limit of the $SU(3)$ symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with dimensions up to $9\times9$ lattice sites across the full doping range. Using a three-flavor extension of Gutzwiller-projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS), a neural network based variational ansatz, we analyze two- and three-point spin-spin and spin-spin-hole correlations of the $SU(3)$ Cartan generators. We further study binding energies for large periodic systems, and compare our results to the paradigmatic $SU(2)$ square lattice equivalent, finding strikingly similar magnetic correlations, but enhanced binding energies. Our results provide a foundation for future exploration of doped SU(N) Mott insulators, providing valuable insights for both theoretical developments and quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states. We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting with minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter and an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.</description>

      <title>Impurity strength-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of nonuniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients nonlocally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>
