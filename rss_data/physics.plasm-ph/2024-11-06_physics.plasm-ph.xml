      <title>An explicit numerical scheme for Milne's phase-amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit numerical method to solve Milne's phase-amplitude equations. Previously proposed methods solve directly Milne's nonlinear equation for the amplitude. For that reason, they exhibit high sensitivity to errors and are prone to instability through the growth of a spurious, rapidly varying component of the amplitude. This makes the systematic use of these methods difficult. On the contrary, the present method is based on solving a linear third-order equation which is equivalent to the nonlinear amplitude equation. This linear equation was derived by Kiyokawa, who used it to obtain analytical results on Coulomb wavefunctions [Kiyokawa, AIP Advances, 2015]. The present method uses this linear equation for numerical computation, thus resolving the problem of the growth of a rapidly varying component.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics and particle transport in capacitively coupled Ar/O2 discharges driven by sawtooth up voltage waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One dimensional fluid/electron Monte Carlo simulations of capacitively coupled Ar/O2 discharges driven by sawtooth up voltage waveforms are performed as a function of the number of consecutive harmonics driving frequencies of 13.56 MHz, N (1-3), pressure (200-500 mTorr) and gas mixture (10-90 % admixture of O2 to Ar). The effects of these external parameters on the electron dynamics, and the transport of ions and neutrals are revealed at constant peak-to-peak driving voltage. The electronegativity is found to decline as the number of consecutive harmonics increases and the DC self-bias voltage decreases. Increasing the pressure also leads to a decrease in electronegativity. The combination of a decrease in the mean free path of electrons and the presence of the Electrical Asymmetry Effect (EAE) result in different spatio-temporal distributions of the ionization rate, which lead to a reduction in the amplitude of the DC self-bias at higher pressure. As the admixture of electronegative O2 increases, the electronegativity is enhanced, and the discharge mode changes from an {\alpha}-Drift Ambipolar (DA) hybrid to DA mode. This work focuses on linking these fundamental changes of the plasma physics induced by changing external parameters to process relevant charged particle and neutral fluxes to the electrodes. Particular attention is paid to O(1D) flux, because it is a precursor of deposition. In discharges driven by sawtooth up voltage waveforms, placing the substrate on the grounded electrode and increasing the number of consecutive harmonics, N, can facilitate the deposition process, since the O(1D) flux to the substrate is higher in these scenarios. Moreover, at an O2 admixture of 20%, the O(1D) flux is nearly as high as that at an O2 admixture of 90%, indicating that a higher O(1D) flux can be achieved without excessively increasing the O2 admixture.</description>

      <title>X-ray and Spectral UV Observations of Periodic Pulsations in a Solar Flare Fan/Looptop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simultaneous X-ray and spectral ultraviolet (UV) observations of strikingly-coherent oscillations in emission from a coronal looptop and fan structure, during the impulsive phase of a long-duration M-class solar flare. The 50 s oscillations are observed near in-phase by Solar Orbiter/STIX, GOES, and IRIS Fe XXI intensity, Doppler and non-thermal velocity. For over 5 minutes of their approximate 35 minute duration, the oscillations are so periodic (2-sigma above the power law background), that they are better described as 'periodic pulsations' than the more-widely documented 'quasi-periodic pulsations' often observed during solar flares. By combining time-series analysis of the the multi-instrument datasets with comparison to MHD simulations, we attribute the oscillations to the magnetic tuning fork in the flare looptop-fan region, and betatron acceleration within the lower-altitude flare loops. These interpretations are possible due to the introduced 'Sliding Raster Method' (SliRM) for analysis of slit spectrometer (e.g. IRIS) raster data, to increase the temporal cadence of the observations at the expense of spatial information.</description>

      <title>Contrasting thermodynamic and hydrodynamic entrop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. This work presents the design of a differential pumping system, enabling, for the first time, continuous operation of our kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system successfully maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. Importantly, where the radio emission emanates from in the polar cap region is still uncertain.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades in a charge-limited flow from the star surface.
  We find that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases with increasing distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure; rather, the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.</description>
