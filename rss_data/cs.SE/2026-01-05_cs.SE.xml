      <title>Understanding Security Risks of AI Agents' Dependency Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Package dependencies are a critical control point in modern software supply chains. Dependency changes can substantially alter a project's security posture. As AI coding agents increasingly modify software via pull requests, it is unclear whether their dependency decisions introduce distinct security risks.
  We study 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. Agents select known-vulnerable versions more often than humans (2.46% vs. 1.64%), and their vulnerable selections are more disruptive to remediate, with 36.8% requiring major-version upgrades compared to 12.9% for humans, despite patched alternatives existing in most cases. At the aggregate level, agent-driven dependency work yields a net vulnerability increase of 98, whereas human-authored work yields a net reduction of 1,316. These findings motivate pull-request-time vulnerability screening and registry-aware guardrails to make agent-driven dependency updates safer.</description>

      <title>Advanced Vulnerability Scanning for Open Source Software: Detection and Mitigation of Log4j Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of software vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge in software security. Log4j is an industrial-grade Java logging framework listed as one of the top 100 critical open source projects. On Dec. 10, 2021 a severe vulnerability Log4Shell was disclosed before being fully patched with Log4j2 version 2.17.0 on Dec. 18, 2021. However, to this day about 4.1 million, or 33 percent of all Log4j downloads in the last 7 days contain vulnerable packages. Many Log4Shell scanners have since been created to detect if a user's installed Log4j version is vulnerable. Current detection tools primarily focus on identifying the version of Log4j installed, leading to numerous false positives, as they do not check if the software scanned is really vulnerable to malicious actors. This research aims to develop an advanced Log4j scanning tool that can evaluate the real-world exploitability of the software, thereby reducing false positives. Our approach first identifies vulnerabilities and then provides targeted recommendations for mitigating these detected vulnerabilities, along with instant feedback to users. By leveraging GitHub Actions, our tool offers automated and continuous scanning capabilities, ensuring timely identification of vulnerabilities as code changes occur. This integration into existing development workflows enables real-time monitoring and quicker responses to potential threats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating 28 open-source software projects across different releases, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4% from a sample of 140 scans. Our GitHub action implementation is available at the GitHub marketplace and can be accessed by anyone interested in improving their software security and for future studies. This tool provides a dependable way to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in open-source projects.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Evaluation of LLM-Based Approaches for Code Vulnerability Detection: RAG, SFT, and Dual-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for automated software vulnerability detection, a crucial task in securing modern codebases. This paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of LLM-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities. The study evaluates three approaches, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and a Dual-Agent LLM framework, against a baseline LLM model. A curated dataset was compiled from Big-Vul and real-world code repositories from GitHub, focusing on five critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories: CWE-119, CWE-399, CWE-264, CWE-20, and CWE-200. Our RAG approach, which integrated external domain knowledge from the internet and the MITRE CWE database, achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.86) and F1 score (0.85), highlighting the value of contextual augmentation. Our SFT approach, implemented using parameter-efficient QLoRA adapters, also demonstrated strong performance. Our Dual-Agent system, an architecture in which a secondary agent audits and refines the output of the first, showed promise in improving reasoning transparency and error mitigation, with reduced resource overhead. These results emphasize that incorporating a domain expertise mechanism significantly strengthens the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world vulnerability detection tasks.</description>

      <title>In Line with Context: Repository-Level Code Generation via Context Inlining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repository-level code generation has attracted growing attention in recent years. Unlike function-level code generation, it requires the model to understand the entire repository, reasoning over complex dependencies across functions, classes, and modules. However, existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or context-based function selection often fall short: they primarily rely on surface-level similarity and struggle to capture the rich dependencies that govern repository-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce InlineCoder, a novel framework for repository-level code generation. InlineCoder enhances the understanding of repository context by inlining the unfinished function into its call graph, thereby reframing the challenging repository understanding as an easier function-level coding task. Given a function signature, InlineCoder first generates a draft completion, termed an anchor, which approximates downstream dependencies and enables perplexity-based confidence estimation. This anchor drives a bidirectional inlining process: (i) Upstream Inlining, which embeds the anchor into its callers to capture diverse usage scenarios; and (ii) Downstream Retrieval, which integrates the anchor's callees into the prompt to provide precise dependency context. The enriched context, combining draft completion with upstream and downstream perspectives, equips the LLM with a comprehensive repository view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the complexities of automatic detection of software similarities, in relation to the unique challenges of digital artifacts, and introduces Project Martial, an open-source software solution for detecting code similarity. This research enumerates some of the existing approaches to counter software plagiarism by examining both the academia and legal landscape, including notable lawsuits and court rulings that have shaped the understanding of software copyright infringements in commercial applications. Furthermore, we categorize the classes of detection challenges based on the available artifacts, and we provide a survey of the previously studied techniques in the literature, including solutions based on fingerprinting, software birthmarks, or code embeddings, and exemplify how a subset of them can be applied in the context of Project Martial.</description>

      <title>DSL or Code? Evaluating the Quality of LLM-Generated Algebraic Specifications: A Case Study in Optimization at Kinaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00469v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides abstraction and analytical rigour, but industrial adoption in many domains has been limited by the cost of developing and maintaining models. Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Coordinated Rename Refactoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary value of AI agents in software development lies in their ability to extend the developer's capacity for reasoning and action, not to supplant human involvement. To showcase how to use agents working in tandem with developers, we designed a novel approach for carrying out coordinated renaming. Coordinated renaming, where a single rename refactoring triggers refactorings in multiple, related identifiers, is a frequent yet challenging task. Developers must manually propagate these rename refactorings across numerous files and contexts, a process that is both tedious and highly error-prone. State-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches produce an overwhelming number of false positives, while vanilla Large Language Models (LLMs) provide incomplete suggestions due to their limited context and inability to interact with refactoring tools. This leaves developers with incomplete refactorings or burdens them with filtering too many false positives. Coordinated renaming is exactly the kind of repetitive task that agents can significantly reduce the developers' burden while keeping them in the driver's seat.
  We designed, implemented, and evaluated the first multi-agent framework that automates coordinated renaming. It operates on a key insight: a developer's initial refactoring is a clue to infer the scope of related refactorings. Our Scope Inference Agent first transforms this clue into an explicit, natural-language Declared Scope. The Planned Execution Agent then uses this as a strict plan to identify program elements that should undergo refactoring and safely executes the changes by invoking the IDE's own trusted refactoring APIs. Finally, the Replication Agent uses it to guide the project-wide search. We first conducted a formative study on the practice of coordinated renaming in 609K commits in 100 open-source projects and surveyed 205 developers ...</description>

      <title>STELLAR: A Search-Based Testing Framework for Large Language Model Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00497v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based applications are increasingly deployed across various domains, including customer service, education, and mobility. However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (SE) requires having a curated collection of models suited to SE tasks. With millions of models hosted on Hugging Face (HF) and new ones continuously being created, it is infeasible to identify SE models without a dedicated catalogue. To address this gap, we present SEMODS: an SE-focused dataset of 3,427 models extracted from HF, combining automated collection with rigorous validation through manual annotation and large language model assistance. Our dataset links models to SE tasks and activities from the software development lifecycle, offering a standardized representation of their evaluation results, and supporting multiple applications such as data analysis, model discovery, benchmarking, and model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort in AI-Generated Pull Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous AI agents transition from code completion tools to full-fledged teammates capable of opening pull requests (PRs) at scale, software maintainers face a new challenge: not just reviewing code, but managing complex interaction loops with non-human contributors. This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins?
  Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting).
  We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance.
  Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Talk Less, Verify More: Improving LLM Assistants with Semantic Checks and Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) assistants become increasingly integrated into enterprise workflows, their ability to generate accurate, semantically aligned, and executable outputs is critical. However, current conversational business analytics (CBA) systems often lack built-in verification mechanisms, leaving users to manually validate potentially flawed results. This paper introduces two complementary verification techniques: Q*, which performs reverse translation and semantic matching between code and user intent, and Feedback+, which incorporates execution feedback to guide code refinement. Embedded within a generator-discriminator framework, these mechanisms shift validation responsibilities from users to the system. Evaluations on three benchmark datasets, Spider, Bird, and GSM8K, demonstrate that both Q* and Feedback+ reduce error rates and task completion time. The study also identifies reverse translation as a key bottleneck, highlighting opportunities for future improvement. Overall, this work contributes a design-oriented framework for building more reliable, enterprise-grade GenAI systems capable of trustworthy decision support.</description>

      <title>Security in the Age of AI Teammates: An Empirical Study of Agentic Pull Requests on GitHub</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous coding agents are increasingly deployed as AI teammates in modern software engineering, independently authoring pull requests (PRs) that modify production code at scale. This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems. PR rejection is more strongly associated with PR complexity and verbosity than with explicit security topics.</description>

      <title>Cost-Performance Analysis of Cloud-Based Retail Point-of-Sale Systems: A Comparative Study of Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Althoughthereislittleempiricalresearchonplatform-specific performance for retail workloads, the digital transformation of the retail industry has accelerated the adoption of cloud-based Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This paper presents a systematic, repeatable comparison of POS workload deployments on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure using real-time API endpoints and open-source benchmarking code. Using free-tier cloud resources, we offer a transparent methodology for POS workload evaluation that small retailers and researchers can use. Our approach measures important performance metrics like response latency, throughput, and scalability while estimating operational costs based on actual resource usage and current public cloud pricing because there is no direct billing under free-tier usage. All the tables and figures in this study are generated directly from code outputs, ensuring that the experimental data and the reported results are consistent. Our analysis shows that GCP achieves 23.0% faster response times at baseline load, while Azure shows 71.9% higher cost efficiency for steady-state operations. We look at the architectural components that lead to these differences and provide a helpful framework for merchants considering cloud point-of-sale implementation. This study establishes a strong, open benchmarking methodology for retail cloud applications and offers the first comprehensive, code-driven comparison of workloads unique to point-of-sale systems across leading cloud platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Characterizing Vulnerabilities in Intelligent Connected Vehicles through Real-World Exploits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are a core component of modern transportation systems, and their security is crucial as it directly relates to user safety. Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>KELP: Robust Online Log Parsing Through Evolutionary Grouping Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time log analysis is the cornerstone of observability for modern infrastructure. However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

      <title>A Survey on the Application of Large Language Models in Scenario-Based Testing of Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) must be validated prior to large-scale deployment. Among existing validation approaches, scenario-based testing has been regarded as a promising method to improve testing efficiency and reduce associated costs. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to reinforce this approach. While an increasing number of studies have explored the use of LLMs in the field of automated driving, a dedicated review focusing on their application within scenario-based testing remains absent. This survey addresses this gap by systematically categorizing the roles played by LLMs across various phased of scenario-based testing, drawing from both academic research and industrial practice. In addition, key characteristics of LLMs and corresponding usage strategies are comprehensively summarized. The paper concludes by outlining five open challenges and potential research directions. To support ongoing research efforts, a continuously updated repository of recent advancements and relevant open-source tools is made available at: https://github.com/ftgTUGraz/LLM4ADSTest.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging Language Gaps in OSS with LLM-Driven Documentation Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors across the globe, only a few open source software repositories provide essential documentation, such as ReadMe or CONTRIBUTING files, in languages other than English. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. We have also seen advances in the use of LLMs for translations in other domains and contexts. Despite this progress, little is known regarding the capabilities of LLMs in translating open-source technical documentation, which is often a mixture of natural language, code, URLs, and markdown formatting. To better understand the need and potential for LLMs to support translation of technical documentation in open source, we conducted an empirical evaluation of translation activity and translation capabilities of two powerful large language models (OpenAI ChatGPT 4 and Anthropic Claude). We found that translation activity is often community-driven and most frequent in larger repositories. A comparison of LLM performance as translators and evaluators of technical documentation suggests LLMs can provide accurate semantic translations but may struggle preserving structure and technical content. These findings highlight both the promise and the challenges of LLM-assisted documentation internationalization and provide a foundation towards automated LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.</description>

      <title>AI Where It Matters: Where, Why, and How Developers Want AI Support in Daily Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where developers most need support and how to design it responsibly. We report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers examining where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help across SE tasks. Using cognitive appraisal theory, we provide the first empirically validated mapping of developers' task appraisals to AI adoption patterns and Responsible AI (RAI) priorities. Appraisals predict AI openness and use, revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and demand for improvement in core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g., documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). RAI priorities vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks; transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.</description>

      <title>A Magnified View into Heterogeneous-ISA Thread Migration Performance without State Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Bugs and Quality Attributes in Quantum Software: A Large-Scale Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Out-of-Distribution Detection in Real-time Object Detection: From Benchmark Pitfalls to a New Mitigation Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs pose a persistent challenge to deep learning models, often triggering overconfident predictions on non-target objects. While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.
