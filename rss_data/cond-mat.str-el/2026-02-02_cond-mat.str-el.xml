      <title>Anisotropic Kitaev Spin Glass in Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22280v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\beta$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.</description>

      <title>Field-induced transitions from incommensurate to commensurate phases in helical antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heisenberg antiferromagnet with an easy-plane anisotropy is discussed in which a magnetic spiral is induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and/or frustration of the exchange coupling. The distortion of the spiral by small in-plane magnetic field is described analytically. It is found that the field can gradually change the vector of the magnetic structure ${\bf k}_0$ and can produce transitions between phases with incommensurate and commensurate magnetic orderings when ${\bf k}_0$ is close to ${\bf g}/n$, where ${\bf g}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector and $n$ is integer. Analytical expressions for critical fields are derived for $n=2$, 3, and 4. Application of the theory to the triangular-lattice compound $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$ is discussed alongside its potential applicability to other materials. As a by-product of the main consideration, model parameters are found which describe more accurately the full set of available experimental data suggested before for $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and magnetic triple-q state in GdGaI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the physical properties of the magnetic van der Waals material GdGaI. Using first-principles calculations, we compute the phonon dispersion of GdGaI and show no imaginary phonons, suggesting that phonon-driven phase transitions are unlikely to occur in GdGaI. Our band calculation reveals that the electronic bands near the Fermi energy are composed of Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals. We construct a tight-binding model that incorporates the Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals to investigate the magnetic structure. We introduce Kondo coupling between electrons in Gd 5d orbitals and localized spins in Gd 4f orbitals and present the modified band structure when localized spins form a magnetic order characterized by three q vectors that connect the valence and conduction bands. We discuss the origin of the spin order based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida mechanism and suggest that Coulomb interactions acting on electrons near the Fermi level can contribute to the ordering of localized spins.</description>

      <title>Understanding the sign problem from an exact Path Integral Monte Carlo model of interacting harmonic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows that the recently discovered operator contraction identity for solving the discreet Path Integral of the harmonic oscillator can be applied equally to fermions in any dimension. This then yields an exactly solvable model for studying the sign problem where the Path Integral Monte Carlo energy at any time step for any number of fermions is known analytically, or can be computed numerically. It is found that repulsive/attractive pairwise interaction shifts the sign problem to larger/smaller imaginary time, but does not make it more severe than the non-interacting case. More surprisingly, for closed-shell number of fermions, the sign problem goes away at large imaginary time. Fourth-order and newly found variable-bead algorithms are used to compute ground state energies of quantum dots with up to 110 electrons and compared to results obtained by modern neural networks.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced topological magnon in electron-magnon coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the emergence of topological magnons in electron-magnon coupled systems. The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM. Specifically, we consider a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator and a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and investigate topological gap opening in magnon bands. Our findings reveal that even trivial ferromagnets can host topological magnons via coupling to itinerant electronic systems.</description>

      <title>N-state Potts ices as generalizations of classical and quantum spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and quantum spin ice models are amongst the most popular settings for the study of spin liquid physics. $N-$state Potts ice models have been constructed that generalize spin ice, hosting multiple emergent $\text{U}(1)$ gauge fields and excitations charged under non-trivial combinations of these fields. We present a general treatment of classical $N-$state Potts ices relating their properties to the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Lie algebras, and demonstrate how the properties of charged excitations in the classical model can be related to this symmetry group. We also introduce quantum generalizations of the Potts Ice models, and demonstrate how charge flavor changing interactions unique to $N&gt;2$ models dominate their low energy physics. We further show how symmetries inherited from the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ can lead to flux vacuum frustration, greatly modifying the dynamical properties of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Spiral Phase and Phase Diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ Model on the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ model on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice using exact diagonalization (ED), density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) with DMRG as a solver. In the isotropic case ($\Delta=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $\Delta$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $\Delta$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Conical Magnetic Structure and Atomic Displacements in Chiral Helimagnet Yb(Ni,Cu)$_3$Al$_9$ in Magnetic Fields along the Helical $c$ Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the conical magnetic state of a uniaxial chiral helimagnet Yb(Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_3$Al$_9$ induced in magnetic fields applied along the $c$ axis, which coincides with the helical axis at zero field. Using resonant X-ray diffraction, we clearly observed the disappearance of magnetic satellite peaks, corresponding to the transition from the conical to the field-induced ferromagnetic state. The critical fields were determined to be 4 T for $x=0$ and 7 T for $x= 0.05$, which were hardly discernible in the magnetization curves. We also found that atomic displacements with the same propagation vector emerge simultaneously with the onset of the conical order. The transition temperature $T_{\text{N}}$ and the critical fields for $H \parallel c$ ($H_{\text{c}}^{z}$) and $H\perp c$ ($H_{\text{c}}^{x}$) are discussed on the basis of a mean-field calculation for a simple $q=1$ model of the magnetic structure. We propose that $T_{\text{N}}$ and $H_{\text{c}}^{z}$ primarily reflect the dominant intralayer exchange interactions within the honeycomb Yb-layer, whereas $H_{\text{c}}^{x}$ is governed by the much weaker interlayer coupling.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field control of the excitonic transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of excitonic insulator phases in quantum materials is often masked by structural distortions caused by the coupling between electronic and phononic order parameters. Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Moire folded helical states at the interfaces of heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minimal model of a graphene topological insulator heterostructure is considered, where a moire superlattice modulates the Rashba spin orbit interaction. In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum bootstrap product codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product constructions constitute a powerful method for generating quantum CSS codes, yielding celebrated examples such as toric codes and asymptotically good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling Between RF Photons and Plasmons of Electrons on Liquid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons, arising from the collective motion of electrons, can interact strongly with electromagnetic fields or photons; this capability has been exploited across a broad range of applications, from chemical reactivity to biosensing. Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.</description>

      <title>Electronic Origin of Density Wave Orders in a Trilayer Nickelate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has established a new frontier in the study of high-temperature superconductors. However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family.</description>

      <title>Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are among the most intriguing phenomena that can occur when the electronic ground state of correlated metals are tuned by external parameters such as pressure, magnetic field or chemical substitution. Such transitions between distinct states of matter are driven by quantum fluctuations, and can give rise to macroscopically coherent phases that are at the forefront of condensed matter research. However, the nature of the critical fluctuations, and thus the fundamental physics controlling many quantum phase transitions, remain poorly understood in numerous strongly correlated metals. Here we study the model material CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ to gain insight into the implications of critical fluctuations originating from different regions in reciprocal space. By employing an external magnetic field along the crystallographic $a$- and $c$-axis as auxiliary tuning parameter we observe a pronounced anisotropy in the suppression of the quantum critical fluctuations, reflecting the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state at larger silver concentration. Coupled with the temperature dependence of the quantum critical fluctuations, these results suggest that the quantum phase transition in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ is driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Discovering topological phases in gray-Tin</title>

Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pressure dependence of the bulk modulus and Yb valence in cubic YbPd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Yb valence instabilities in the strongly correlated YbPd compound using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy as a function of pressure across the charge-order (CO) transition. At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_L$ = 1.5 $\pm {0.2}$ GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure-dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.6 $\pm {0.2}$ GPa. In contrast, for P $&gt;$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valence saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening. The results show a minimum in the compressibility of YbPd (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ hole-type mixed-valence), reminiscent of the maximum in compressibility seen in the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ first-order isostructural phase transition in cerium (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ electron-type mixed-valence).</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>

Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Consequences of symmetry-breaking on conformal defect data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.</description>
