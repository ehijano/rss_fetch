Abstract: Living cells exhibit non-equilibrium dynamics emergent from the intricate interplay between molecular motor activity and its viscoelastic cytoskeletal matrix. The deviation from thermal equilibrium can be quantified through frequency-dependent effective temperature or time-reversal symmetry breaking quantified e.g. through the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Here, we investigate the fluctuations of an AFM tip embedded within the active cortex of mitotic human cells with and without perturbations that reduce cortex activity through inhibition of material turnover or motor proteins. While inhibition of motor activity significantly reduces both effective temperature and time irreversibility, inhibited material turnover leaves the effective temperature largely unchanged but lowers the time irreversibility and entropy production rate. Our experimental findings in combination with a minimal model highlight that time irreversibility, effective temperature and entropy production rate can follow opposite trends in active living systems, challenging in particular the validity of effective temperature as a proxy for the distance from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we propose that the strength of thermal noise and the occurrence of time-asymmetric deflection spikes in the dynamics of regulated observables are inherently coupled in living systems, revealing a previously unrecognized link between entropy production and time irreversibility.</description>
