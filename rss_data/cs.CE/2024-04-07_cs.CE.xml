      <title>Quantum-informed simulations for mechanics of materials: DFTB+MBD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic behaviors of materials are determined by interactions that occur at multiple lengths and time scales. Depending on the application, describing, predicting, and understanding these behaviors require models that rely on insights from electronic and atomic scales. In such cases, classical simplified approximations at those scales are insufficient, and quantum-based modeling is required. In this paper, we study how quantum effects can modify the mechanical properties of systems relevant to materials engineering. We base our study on a high-fidelity modeling framework that combines two computationally efficient models rooted in quantum first principles: Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) and many-body dispersion (MBD). The MBD model is applied to accurately describe non-covalent van der Waals interactions. Through various benchmark applications, we demonstrate the capabilities of this framework and the limitations of simplified modeling. We provide an open-source repository containing all codes, datasets, and examples presented in this work. This repository serves as a practical toolkit that we hope will support the development of future research in effective large-scale and multiscale modeling with quantum-mechanical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis -- Part I: A Knowledge-Integrated Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose to adopt a novel framework, Knowledge-integrated Machine Learning, for advancing Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) development. Given the significance of PEMWE in green hydrogen production and the inherent challenges in optimizing its performance, our framework aims to meld data-driven models with domain-specific insights systematically to address the domain challenges. We first identify the uncertainties originating from data acquisition conditions, data-driven model mechanisms, and domain expertise, highlighting their complementary characteristics in carrying information from different perspectives. Building upon this foundation, we showcase how to adeptly decompose knowledge and extract unique information to contribute to the data augmentation, modeling process, and knowledge discovery. We demonstrate a hierarchical three-level framework, termed the "Ladder of Knowledge-integrated Machine Learning", in the PEMWE context, applying it to three case studies within a context of cell degradation analysis to affirm its efficacy in interpolation, extrapolation, and information representation. This research lays the groundwork for more knowledge-informed enhancements in ML applications in engineering.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking formalisms for dynamic structure system Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of complex systems is key to explore systems dynamics. Many scientific approaches were developed to represent dynamic structure systems but most of these approaches are efficient for some kinds of systems and inefficient for others. Which approach can be adopted for different dynamic structure systems categories is a topic of interest for many researchers and until now has not been fully resolved. Therefore it is essential to explore the existing approaches, understand them, and identify gaps. To fulfil this goal, we identified criteria at stake for a smooth flow from model creation to its simulation for dynamic structure systems. Using these criteria, we benchmark the existing modeling formalisms focusing more on DEVS extensions, and use the results to identify approaches gaps and discuss them.</description>
