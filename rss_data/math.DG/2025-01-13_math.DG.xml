      <title>Singularity of mean curvature flow with bounded mean curvature and Morse index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity of the singularity of mean curvature flow with bounded mean curvature and Morse index. For $3\leq n\leq 6$, we show that either the mean curvature or the Morse index blows up at the first singular time for a closed smooth embedded mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Serrin's type Problems in convex cones in Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss several results concerning Serrin's problem in convex cones in Riemannian manifolds. First, we present a rigidity result for an overdetermined problem in a class of warped products with Ricci curvature bounded below. As a consequence, we obtain a rigidity result for Einstein warped products. Next, we derive a soap bubble result and a Heintze-Karcher inequality that characterize the intersection of geodesic balls with cones in these spaces. Finally, we analyze the analogous ovedetermined problem for the drift Laplacian, where the ambient space is a cone in the Euclidean space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will construct H\"ormander's $L^2$-estimate of the operator $d$ on a flat vector bundle over a $p$-convex Riemannian manifold and discuss some geometric applications of it.

      <title>An Atiyah-Bott formula for the Lefschetz number of a singular foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formula for the Lefschetz number of a geometric endomorphism in the style of the Atiyah-Bott theorem. The underlying data consist, first, of a compact manifold and a nowhere vanishing smooth real vector field $\mathcal{T}$ that preserves some Riemannian metric, and second, a sequence of first order operators on sections of Hermitian vector bundles with connection whose curvature is annihilated by $\mathcal{T}$ and for which parallel transport along integral curves of $\mathcal{T}$ is unitary. Assuming that the operators of the sequence commute with the various covariant derivatives $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}=\nabla_{\mathcal{T}}$ and that their restriction to the spaces of sections annihilated by $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}$ form a complex, an ellipticity condition gives finite-dimensionality of the resulting equivariant cohomology spaces. The Atiyah-Bott framework, adapted to give a geometric endomorphism only for the complex of $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}$-parallel sections, together with the finiteness of cohomology allows for the definition of a Lefschetz number. Replacing the condition that the fixed points of the equivariant map $f$ associated with the endomorphism be simple by a condition on wave front sets, which is the underlying condition of Atiyah and Bott, yields that the set of closures of orbits by $\mathcal{T}$ left invariant by $f$ is finite, and then a formula similar to theirs, now relating the Lefschetz number with traces along these orbits.</description>

      <title>Maximality of the futures of points in globally hyperbolic maximal conformally flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic conformally spacetime. We prove that the indecomposable past/future sets (abbrev. IPs/IFs) -- in the sense of Penrose, Kronheimer and Geroch -- of the universal cover of $M$ are domains of injectivity of the developing map. This relies on the central observation that diamonds are domains of injectivity of the developing map. Using this, we provide a new proof of a result of completeness by C. Rossi, which notably simplifies the original arguments. Furthermore, we establish that if, in addition, $M$ is maximal, the IPs/IFs are maximal as globally hyperbolic conformally flat spacetimes. More precisely, we show that they are conformally equivalent to regular domains of Minkowski spacetime as defined by F. Bonsante.</description>

      <title>Some Sobolev-type inequalities for twisted differential forms on real and complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove certain $L^p$ Sobolev-type inequalities for twisted differential forms on real (and complex) manifolds for the Laplace operator $\Delta$, the differential operators $d$ and $d^*$, and the operator $\bar\partial$. A key tool to get such inequalities are integral representations for twisted differential forms. The proofs of the main results involves certain uniform estimate for the Green forms and their differentials and codifferentials, which are also established in the present work. As applications of the uniform estimates, using Hodge theory, we can get an $L^{q,p}$-estimate for the operator $d$ or $\bar\partial$. Furthermore, we get an improved $L^2$-estimate of H\"ormander on a strictly pseudoconvex open subset of a K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>Differential forms on diffeological spaces and diffeological gluing, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:1605.07328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to describe the behavior of diffeological differential forms under the operation of gluing of diffeological spaces along a smooth map. In the diffeological context, two ways of looking at diffeological forms are available, that of the vector space of all diffeological forms on a given space, and that of the pseudo-bundle of values of these forms. We describe the behavior of the former under a gluing of diffeological spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two versions of a global implicit function theorem, which involve no loss of derivative, for Keller's $ C_c^1 $-mappings between arbitrary Fr\'{e}chet spaces. Subsequently, within this framework, we apply these theorems to establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial value problems that involve the loss of one derivative. Moreover, we prove a Lagrange multiplier theorem by employing indirect applications of the global implicit function theorems through submersions and transversality.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the uniform doubling property holds for every Lie group which can be written as a quotient group of $\operatorname{SU}(2) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. In particular, this class includes the four-dimensional unitary group $\operatorname{U}(2)$. As this class contain non-compact as well as compact Lie groups, we discuss a number of analytic and spectral consequences for the corresponding heat kernels.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Scalar curvature, S-curvature and distortion on $\infty$-Einstein Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, corresponding to the weighted Ricci curvature, we discuss a class of Einstein Finsler metrics, which can be considered as a sequence of Einstein metrics on the general $CD(\infty,K)$ space. We investigate the non-Riemannian curvature conditions to ensure the equivalence of those metrics. With the bounds of the Ricci curvature, we can estimate the lower bounds of the S-curvature and the distortion. By arising a scalar curvature, we obtain an important formula relating the scalar curvature and the distortion. In some assumptions about some non-Riemannian curvatures, we get both the upper and lower bounds of the scalar curvature, the S-curvature and the distortion. We also discuss such bounds by using the lower bounds of the scalar curvature on the forward complete asymmetric $\infty$-Einstein Finsler manifold. The results in this manuscript will further lead us to study geometric analysis problems in general Finsler geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a group homomorphism between spaces of smooth sections of Lie group bundles to be a weighted composition operator. These results provide new insights into a wide range of problems related to weighted composition operators. Specifically, we prove that the algebraic structure of the space of smooth sections of an algebra bundle, where the typical fiber is a finite dimensional simple algebra, completely determines the bundle structure. Furthermore, we derive a homomorphism version of the Shanks-Pursell theorem and identify a class of homomorphisms of multiplicative semigroups between spaces of smooth functions on finite dimensional manifolds, including all isomorphisms. Our approach is based on a method called range decreasing group homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $\overline{\rho}$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields. This is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology in view of the compact support condition.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent for unbounded convex functions on Hadamard manifolds and its applications to scaling problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of continuous-time and discrete-time gradient flows of a ``lower-unbounded" convex function $f$ on a Hadamard manifold $M$, particularly, their convergence properties to the boundary $M^{\infty}$ at infinity of $M$. We establish a duality theorem that the infimum of the gradient-norm $\|\nabla f(x)\|$ of $f$ over $M$ is equal to the supremum of the negative of the recession function $f^{\infty}$ of $f$ over the boundary $M^{\infty}$, provided the infimum is positive. Further, the infimum and the supremum are obtained by the limits of the gradient flows of $f$, Our results feature convex-optimization ingredients of the moment-weight inequality for reductive group actions by Georgoulas, Robbin, and Salamon,and are applied to noncommutative optimization by B\"urgisser et al. FOCS 2019. We show that the gradient descent of the Kempf-Ness function for an unstable orbit converges to a 1-parameter subgroup in the Hilbert-Mumford criterion, and the associated moment-map sequence converges to the mimimum-norm point of the moment polytope. We show further refinements for operator scaling -- the left-right action on a matrix tuple $A= (A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N)$. We characterize the gradient-flow limit of operator scaling by a vector-space generalization of the classical Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of a bipartite graph. Also, for a special case of $N = 2$, we reveal that this limit determines the Kronecker canonical form of matrix pencils $s A_1+A_2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on bounded pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We proved that under certain assumptions, this soliton is a K\"ahler-Einstein metric. Building on the work of Huang and Xiao, we investigate an analogue of Cheng's conjecture for the Bergman K\"ahler-Ricci soliton. Additionally, we introduce some model domains as examples.</description>
