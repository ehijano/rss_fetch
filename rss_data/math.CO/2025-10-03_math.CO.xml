      <title>On the variety of general position problems under vertex and edge removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G)$, ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$, and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)$ be the total, the outer, and the dual general position number of a graph $G$. This paper investigates how removing a vertex or removing an edge affects these graph invariants. It is proved that if $x$ is not a cut vertex, then ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) -1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G-x) \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) + {\rm deg}_G(x)$. On the other hand, ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-x)$ and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-x)$ can be respectively arbitrarily larger/smaller than ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$ and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)$. On the positive side, it is proved that if $x$ lies in some ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}$-set, then ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)-1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-x)$, and that if $x$ is not a cut vertex and lies in some ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}$-set of $G$, then $ {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)-1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-x)$. For the edge removal, it is proved that (i) ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) -|S(G)_{e}| \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G-e) \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) +2$, where $S(G)_{e}$ is the set of simplicial vertices adjacent both endvertices of $e$, (ii) ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)/2\le {\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-e)\leq\ 2{\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$, and (iii) that ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G) - {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-e)$ can be arbitrarily large. All bounds proved are demonstrated to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Random Finite Sumsets and Product Sets in Subsets of the Natural Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of additive and multiplicative structures in random subsets of the natural numbers. Specifically, for a Bernoulli random subset of $\mathbb{N}$ where each integer is included independently with probability $p\in (0,1)$, we prove that almost surely such a set contains finite sumsets (FS-sets) and finite product sets (FP-sets) of every finite length. In addition, we establish a novel connection between Hindman's partition theorem and the central limit theorem, providing a probabilistic perspective on the asymptotic Gaussian behavior of monochromatic finite sums and products. These results can be interpreted as probabilistic analogues of finite-dimensional versions of Hindman's theorem. Applications, implications, and open questions related to infinite FS-sets and FP-sets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Face Distributions in Random Reduced $\mathfrak s\mathfrak l_3$ Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of interior faces in uniformly random reduced $\mathfrak s \mathfrak l_3$ webs. Using Tymoczko's bijection between $3\times n$ standard Young tableaux and reduced webs, this problem can be reformulated in terms of constrained lattice paths and associated $m$-diagrams. We develop a framework that expresses crossing probabilities in the $m$-diagram as solutions to discrete Dirichlet problems on the triangular lattice, which are evaluated through solutions to lattice Green's functions. From this we obtain explicit limiting formulas for the frequencies of interior faces of each type. As an application, we analyze faces at a distance at least $d$ from the boundary. We prove that almost all interior faces far from the boundary are hexagons, while faces of size $6+2k$ occur with probability $O(d^{-2k})$.</description>

      <title>Competitively Constructed Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study two Maker-Breaker-like games for constructing planar graphs: the edge drawing game, where two players take turns drawing non-intersecting edges between points in the plane, and the circle packing game, where the players take turns placing disjoint circles in the plane. Both games produce planar graphs: the edge drawing game results in a plane graph drawing, and the circle packing game yields a planar graph via the contact graph of the packing. For both games, we give necessary conditions under which a given planar graph can be constructed. We also show that the two games are indeed different by giving a class of graphs which can be constructed in one but not the other.</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions for the independence polynomial on restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalising the Heilman-Lieb Theorem from statistical physics, Chudnovsky and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97(3):350--357] showed that the univariate independence polynomial of any claw-free graph has all of its zeros on the negative real line. In this paper, we show that for any fixed subdivded claw $H$ and any $\Delta$, there is an open set $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ containing $[0, \infty)$ such that the independence polynomial of any $H$-free graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has all of its zeros outside of $F$. We also show that no such result can hold when $H$ is any graph other than a subdivided claw or if we drop the maximum degree condition.
  We also establish zero-free regions for the multivariate independence polynomial of $H$-free graphs of bounded degree when $H$ is a subdivided claw. The statements of these results are more subtle, but are again best possible in various senses.</description>

      <title>Clique number of xor-powers of Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_\ell(n, k)$ denote the clique number of the xor-product of $\ell$ isomorphic Kneser graphs KG(n,k). Alon and Lubetzky investigated the case of complete graphs as a coding theory problem and showed $f_\ell(n,1)\leq \ell n +1$. Imolay, Kocsis, and Schweitzer proved that $f_2(n,k)\leq n/k +c(k)$.
  Here, the order of magnitude of $c(k)$ is determined to be $\Theta\left( k \binom{2k}{k} \right)$. By explicit constructions and by an algebraic proof, it is shown that $\ell n- 2\ell-1 \leq f_\ell(n,1)\leq \ell n-\ell+1$ (for all $n \geq 1$ and $\ell\geq 3$). Finally, it is proved that the order of magnitude of $f$ lies between $\Omega\left(n^{\left\lfloor \log_2(\ell+1)\right\rfloor}\right)$ and $O\left(n^{\left\lfloor \frac{\ell+1}{2} \right\rfloor} \right)$ (as $\ell$, $k$ are given and $n\to \infty$).
  We conjecture that the lower bound gives the correct exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983, Bouchet conjectured that every flow-admissible signed graph admits a nowhere-zero $6$-flow. In this paper, we prove that Bouchet's conjecture holds for all signed ladders, circular and M\"obius ladders. In fact, all signed ladders, circular and M\"obius ladders admit a nowhere-zero $5$-flow except for one case of signed circular ladders. Of course, the exception also has a nowhere-zero $6$-flow.</description>

      <title>On cuts of small chromatic number in sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given integer $k$, let $\ell_k$ denote the supremum $\ell$ such that every sufficiently large graph $G$ with average degree less than $2\ell$ admits a separator $X \subseteq V(G)$ for which $\chi(G[X]) &lt; k$. Motivated by the values of $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$, a natural conjecture suggests that $\ell_k = k$ for all $k$. We prove that this conjecture fails dramatically: asymptotically, the trivial lower bound $\ell_k \geq \tfrac{k}{2}$ is tight. More precisely, we prove that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and all sufficiently large $k$, we have $\ell_k \leq (1+\varepsilon)\tfrac{k}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Well quasi-order and atomicity for combinatorial structures under consecutive orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider partially ordered sets of combinatorial structures under consecutive orders, meaning that two structures are related when one embeds in the other such that `consecutive' elements remain consecutive in the image. Given such a partially ordered set, we may ask decidability questions about its avoidance sets: subsets defined by a finite number of forbidden substructures. Two such questions ask, given a finite set of structures, whether its avoidance set is well quasi-ordered (i.e. contains no infinite antichains) or atomic (i.e. cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subsets). Extending some recent new approaches, we will establish a general framework, which enables us to answer these problems for a wide class of combinatorial structures, including graphs, digraphs and collections of relations.</description>

      <title>Two conjectures on vertex-disjoint rainbow triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1963, Dirac proved that every $n$-vertex graph has $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles if $n\geq 3k$ and minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq \frac{n+k}{2}$. The base case $n=3k$ can be reduced to the Corr\'adi-Hajn\'al Theorem. Towards a rainbow version of Dirac's Theorem, Hu, Li, and Yang conjectured that for all positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $n\geq 3k$, every edge-colored graph $G$ of order $n$ with $\delta^c(G)\geq \frac{n+k}{2}$ contains $k$ vertex-disjoint rainbow triangles. In another direction, Wu et al. conjectured an exact formula for anti-Ramsey number $ar(n,kC_3)$, generalizing the earlier work of Erd\H{o}s, S\'os and Simonovits. The conjecture of Hu, Li, and Yang was confirmed for the cases $k=1$ and $k=2$. However, Lo and Williams disproved the conjecture when $n\leq \frac{17k}{5}.$ It is therefore natural to ask whether the conjecture holds for $n=\Omega(k)$.
  In this paper, we confirm this by showing that the Hu-Li-Yang conjecture holds when $n\ge 42.5k+48$. We disprove the conjecture of Wu et al. and propose a modified conjecture. This conjecture is motivated by previous works due to Allen, B\"{o}ttcher, Hladk\'{y}, and Piguet on Tur\'an number of vertex-disjoint triangles.</description>

      <title>The odd independence number of graphs, II: Finite and infinite grids and chessboard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An odd independent set $S$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an independent set of vertices such that, for every vertex $v \in V \setminus S$, either $N(v) \cap S = \emptyset$ or $|N(v) \cap S| \equiv 1$ (mod 2), where $N(v)$ stands for the open neighborhood of $v$. The largest cardinality of odd independent sets of a graph $G$, denoted $\alpha_{od}(G)$, is called the odd independence number of $G$.
  This new parameter is a natural companion to the recently introduced strong odd chromatic number. A proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is a strong odd coloring if, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, each color used in the neighborhood of $v$ appears an odd number of times in $N(v)$. The minimum number of colors in a strong odd coloring of $G$ is denoted by $\chi_{so}(G)$.
  A simple relation involving these two parameters and the order $|G|$ of $G$ is $\alpha_{od}(G)\cdot\chi_{so}(G) \geq |G|$, parallel to the same on chromatic number and independence number.
  In the present work, which is a companion to our first paper on the subject [The odd independence number of graphs, I: Foundations and classical classes], we focus on grid-like and chessboard-like graphs and compute or estimate their odd independence number and their strong odd chromatic number. Among the many results obtained, the following give the flavour of this paper:
  (1) $0.375 \leq \varrho_{od}(P_\infty \Box P_\infty) \leq 0.384615...$, where $\varrho_{od}(P_\infty \Box P_\infty)$ is the odd independence ratio.
  (2) $\chi_{so}(G_d) = 3$ for all $d \geq 1$, where $G_d$ is the infinite $d$-dimensional grid. As a consequence, $\varrho_{od}(G_d) \geq 1/3$.
  (3) The $r$-King graph $G$ on $n^2$ vertices has $\alpha_{od}(G) = \lceil n/(2r+1) \rceil^2$. Moreover, $\chi_{so}(G) = (2r + 1)^2$ if $n \geq 2r + 1$, and $\chi_{so}(G) = n^2$ if $n \leq 2r$.
  Many open problems are given for future research.</description>

      <title>A High-Dimensional Extension of Wagner's Theorem and the Geometrization of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric representation of hypergraphs by representing hyperedges as simplices. Building on this framework, we employ homotopy groups to analyze the topological structure of hypergraphs embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Leveraging this foundation, we extend Wagner's theorem to $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we establish that a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph embeds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ if and only if it contains neither $K_{d+3}^d$ nor $K_{3,d+1}^d$ as a minor. Here, a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph constitutes a geometrized form of a $d$-uniform hypergraph, while $K_{d+3}^d$ and $K_{3,d+1}^d$ are the high-dimensional generalizations of the complete graph $K_5$ and the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Kotzig's conjecture in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1963, Anton Kotzig famously conjectured that $K_{n}$, the complete graph of order $n$, where $n$ is even, can be decomposed into $n-1$ perfect matchings such that every pair of these matchings forms a Hamilton cycle. The problem is still wide open and here we consider a variant of it for the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. We prove that, for every fixed $k$, there exists a constant $C=C(k)$ such that, when $p\ge \frac{C \log n}{n}$, with high probability, $G(n,p)$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings with the property that every pair of them forms a Hamilton cycle. In fact, our main result is a very precise counting result for $K_n$. We show that, given any $k$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings $M_1,\dots,M_k$, the probability that a uniformly random perfect matching $M^*$ in $K_n$ has the property that $M^*\cup M_i$ forms a Hamilton cycle for each $i\in [k]$ is $\Theta_k(n^{-k/2})$. This is proved by building on a variety of methods, including a random process analysis, the absorption method, the entropy method and the switching method. The result on the binomial random graph follows from a slight strengthening of our counting result via the recent breakthroughs on the expectation threshold conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Note on Conjectures of Gullerud, Johnson, and Mbirika</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Gullerud, Johnson, and Mbirika presented results on their study of certain tridiagonal real symmetric matrices. As part of their work, they studied the roots to nonhomogeneous equations related to characteristic polynomials of adjacency matrices for path graphs. They showed that a subset of these polynomials give a Fibonacci number when evaluated at the imaginary unit, leading them to make several intriguing conjectures. In this work, we further explore their conjectures regarding the distribution of roots. We make partial progress towards establishing two conjectures, identify an infinite class of polynomials for which a third is false, and give evidence against a fourth.</description>

      <title>Partitioning triangle-free planar graphs into a forest and a linear forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raspaud and Wang conjectured that every triangle-free planar graph can be vertex-partitioned into an independent set and a forest. Independently, Kawarabayashi and Thomassen also remarked that this might be true, after providing another proof of a result of Borodin and Glebov, showing this result for planar graphs of girth~5. Subsequently, Dross, Montassier, and Pinlou raised the same question and proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and another forest of maximum degree~5. More recently, Feghali and \v{S}\'{a}mal improved this bound on the maximum degree to~3. In this note, we further improve the result by showing that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and a linear forest, that is, a forest of maximum degree~2.</description>

      <title>Minimal Trails in Restricted DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the properties of minimal trails in a directed acyclic graph that is restricted not to contain an active cycle are studied. We are motivated by an application of the results in the copula-based Bayesian Network model developed recently. We propose a partial order on the set of trails activated by a certain subset of nodes, and show that every minimal trail, according to such an order, has a simple structure.</description>

      <title>A polynomial algorithm to compute the boxicity and threshold dimension of complements of block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boxicity of a graph $G$ is the minimum dimension $d$ that admits a representation of $G$ as the intersection graph of a family of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Computing boxicity is an NP-hard problem, and there are few known graph classes for which it can be computed in polynomial time. One such class is the class of block graphs. A block graph is a graph in which every maximal $2$-connected component is a clique. Since block graphs are known to have boxicity at most two, computing their boxicity amounts to the linear-time interval graph recognition problem. On the other hand, complements of block graphs have unbounded boxicity, yet we show that there is also a polynomial algorithm that computes the boxicity of complements of block graphs. An adaptation of our approach yields a polynomial algorithm for computing the threshold dimension of the complements of block graphs, which for general graphs is an NP-hard problem. Our method suggests a general technique that may show the tractability of similar problems on block-restricted graph classes.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the propagation radius in power domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $S \subseteq V(G)$. It is said that $S$ \textit{dominates} $N[S]$. We say that $S$ \textit{monitors} vertices of $G$ as follows. Initially, all dominated vertices are monitored. If there exists a vertex $v \in G$ which is not monitored, but has all but one of its neighbours monitored, then $v$ becomes monitored itself. This step is called a \textit{propagation} step and is repeated until the process terminates. The process terminates when the there are no unmonitored vertices with exactly one unmonitored neighbour. This combined process of initial domination and subsequent propagation is called \textit{power domination}. If all vertices of $G$ are monitored at termination, then $S$ is said to be a \textit{power dominating set (PDS) of $G$}. The \textit{power domination number of $G$}, denoted as $\gamma_p(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a PDS of $G$. The \textit{propagation radius of $G$} is the minimum number of steps it takes a minimum PDS to monitor $V(G)$. In this paper we determine an upper bound on the propagation radius of $G$ with regards to power domination, in terms of $\delta$ and $n$. We show that this bound is only attained when $\gamma_p(G)=1$ and then improve this bound for $\gamma_p(G)\geq 2$. Sharpness examples for these bounds are provided. We also present sharp upper bounds on the propagation radius of split graphs. We present sharpness results for a known lower bound of the propagation radius for all $\Delta\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interplay between the Lambert series and Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem gives an Euler-type recurrence relation for any given arithmetical function. As consequences of this, we present Euler-type recurrence relations for some well-known arithmetic functions. Furthermore, we derive Euler-type recurrence relations for certain partition functions and sum-of-divisors functions using infinite product identities of Jacobi and Gauss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give explicit, uniform formulas for the graded characters and total ranks of the Lie algebra homology of finite-dimensional representations in all classical types. In many cases, these compute the Tor groups of finite length modules over polynomial rings, and this is the first in a series of papers to investigate total rank conjectures from this perspective. These formulas refine and generalize the classical $\rho$-decomposition of Kostant, and in particular we prove that the characters involved exhibit three structural phenomena: divisibility (by a large power of 2), equidistribution, and uniform factorization formulas.</description>

      <title>Admissible set and squarefree-power-like function with applications to squarefree symbolic powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract notion of squarefree-power-like functions, which unify the sequences of squarefree ordinary and symbolic powers of squarefree monomial ideals. By employing the Tor-vanishing criteria for mixed sums of ideals, we establish sharp lower bounds for their Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity in terms of what we call the admissible set of the associated hypergraph. As an application, we derive the first general combinatorial lower bound for the regularity of squarefree symbolic powers of monomial ideals. In the setting of edge ideals, by exploiting the special combinatorial structures of block graphs and Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs, we show that this bound turns into an exact formula for all squarefree symbolic powers of block graphs, as well as for the second squarefree symbolic powers of edge ideals of Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Elementary Proofs and Generalizations of Recent Congruences of Thejitha and Fathima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Hirschhorn and the author, Thejitha and Fathima recently considered arithmetic properties satisfied by the function $a_5(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while the odd parts may appear in one of five colors. They proved two sets of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $a_5(n)$, relying heavily on modular forms. In this note, we prove their results via purely elementary means, utilizing generating function manipulations and elementary $q$-series dissections. We then extensively generalize these two sets of congruences to infinite families of divisibility properties in which the results of Thejitha and Fathima are specific instances.</description>

      <title>Finite isoresidual covers in strata of $k$-differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the strata of primitive $k$-differentials on the Riemann sphere whose singularities, except for two, are poles of order divisible by $k$. The map that assigns to each $k$-differential the $k$-residues at these poles is a ramified cover of its image. Generalizing results known in the case of abelian differentials, we describe the ramification locus of this cover and provide a formula, involving the $k$-factorial function, for the cardinality of each fiber. We prove this formula using intersection calculations on the multi-scale compactification of the strata of $k$-differentials. In special cases, we also give alternative proofs using flat geometry. Finally, we present an application to cone spherical metrics with dihedral monodromy.</description>

      <title>Short circuit walks in fixed dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions (circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured (Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard. Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$ inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension.
  In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$ approximating the problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$ is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in fixed dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we sample directed random graphs from (asymmetric) step-graphons and investigate the probability that the random graph has at least a Hamiltonian cycle (or a node-wise Hamiltonian decomposition). We show that for almost all step-graphons, the probability converges to either zero or one as the order of the random graph goes to infinity--we term it the zero-one law. We identify the key objects of the step-graphon that matter for the zero-one law, and establish a set of conditions that can decide whether the limiting value of the probability is zero or one.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of lattice sums via telescoping over topographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topographs, introduced by Conway in 1997, are infinite trivalent planar trees used to visualize the values of binary quadratic forms. In this work, we study series whose terms are indexed by the vertices of a topograph and show that they can be evaluated using telescoping sums over its edges.
  Our technique provides arithmetic proofs for modular graph function identities arising in string theory, yields alternative derivations of Hurwitz-style class number formulas, and provides a unified framework for well-known Mordell-Tornheim series and Hata's series for the Euler constant $\gamma$.
  Our theorems are of the following spirit: we cut a topograph along an edge (called the root) into two parts, and then sum $\frac{1}{rst}$ (the reciprocal of the product of labels on regions adjacent to a vertex) over all vertices of one part. We prove that such a sum is equal to an explicit expression depending only on the root and the discriminant of the topograph.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs for graphs and signed graphs with eigenvalues bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. We show that the family of graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-\lambda$ can be defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs if and only if $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. This resolves a question raised by Bussemaker and Neumaier. As a byproduct, we find all the limit points of smallest eigenvalues of graphs, supplementing Hoffman's work on those limit points in $[-2, \infty)$.
  We also prove that the same conclusion about forbidden subgraph characterization holds for signed graphs. Our impetus for the study of signed graphs is to determine the maximum cardinality of a spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in high dimensions. Denote by $N_{\alpha, \beta}(n)$ the maximum number of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where all pairwise inner products lie in $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ with $-1 \le \beta &lt; 0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. Very recently Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao determined the limit of $N_{\alpha, \beta}(d)/d$ as $d\to\infty$ when $\alpha + 2\beta &lt; 0$ or $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in \{1,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\}$, and they proposed a conjecture on the limit in terms of eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We establish their conjecture whenever $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha - \beta) &lt; \lambda^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is $H$-Ramsey if every two-coloring of its edges contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. Define the $F$-Ramsey number of $H$, denoted by $r_F(H)$, to be the minimum number of copies of $F$ in a graph which is $H$-Ramsey. This generalizes the Ramsey number and size Ramsey number of a graph. Addressing a question of Spiro, we prove that \[r_{K_3}(K_t)=\binom{r(K_t)}{3}\] for all sufficiently large $t$. We do so through a result on graph coloring: there exists an absolute constant $K$ such that every $r$-chromatic graph where every edge is contained in at least $K$ triangles must contain at least $\binom{r}{3}$ triangles in total.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constructions for the Digraph Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiency of routing on a regular digraph often involves finding opitmal properties of the graph. For example, the diameter of a digraph is the maximum distance between any two vertices. We show how we can study these problems algebraically in terms of quasigroups, 1-factors, and permutation groups. Our investigation originated from the study of graphs as the Cayley graphs of groupoids with $d$ generators, a left identity, and right cancellation; that is, a right quasigroup. This enables us to provide compact algebraic definitions for some important graphs that are either given as explicit edge lists or as the Cayley coset graphs of groups larger than the graph. One such example is a single expression for the Hoffman-Singleton graph. From there, we notice that the groupoids can be represented uniquely by a set of disjoint permutations and we explore the consequences of that observation.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

      <title>Counting cospectral graphs obtained via switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switching is an operation on a graph that does not change the spectrum of the adjacency matrix, thus producing cospectral graphs. An important activity in the field of spectral graph theory is the characterization of graphs by their spectrum. Hence, switching provides a tool for disproving the existence of such a characterization.
  This paper presents a general framework for counting the number of graphs that have a non-isomorphic cospectral graph through a switching method, expanding on the work by Haemers and Spence [European Journal of Combinatorics, 2004]. Our framework is based on a different counting approach, which allows it to be used for all known switching methods for the adjacency matrix. From this, we derive asymptotic results, which we complement with computer enumeration results for graphs up to $10$ vertices.</description>

      <title>On graphs with equal and different Kromatic symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kromatic symmetric function (KSF) $\overline{X}_G$ of a graph $G$ is a $K$-analogue introduced by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl in arXiv:2301.02177 of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function (CSF) $X_G$. The KSF is known to distinguish some pairs of graphs with the same CSF. The first author showed in arXiv:2403.15929 and arXiv:2502.21285 that the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs can be determined given $\overline{X}_G$, and conjectured that $\overline{X}_G$ distinguishes all graphs. We disprove that conjecture by finding four pairs of 8-vertex graphs with equal KSF, as well as giving several ways to use existing graph pairs with equal KSF to construct larger graph pairs that also have equal KSF. On the other hand, we show that many of the graph pairs from the constructions of Orellana and Scott in arXiv:1308.6005 and of Aliste-Prieto, Crew, Spirkl, and Zamora in arXiv:2007.11042 of graphs with the same CSF are distinguished by the KSF, thus also giving some new examples of cases where the KSF is a stronger invariant than the CSF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huh-Stevens and Ferroni-Schr\"oter independently conjectured that Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of Chow rings of geometric lattices have only real zeros. Ferroni, Matherne and the second author extended this conjecture to Chow polynomials of Cohen-Macaulay poset. In this paper we address the above conjectures by providing new defining relations and properties of Chow functions of posets and matrices. These are used, in conjunction with new techniques on interlacing sequences of polynomials, to prove that Chow polynomials of totally nonnegative matrices have only real zeros, which, in turn, proves the above conjectures for a class of posets that contains projective and affine geometries, face lattices of cubical polytopes, dual partition and Dowling lattices, perfect matroid designs, and lattices of flats of paving matroids. We also study Chow polynomials of Toeplitz matrices in greater detail, and show how these are related the combinatorics of binomial and Sheffer posets, as well as to a family of generalized Eulerian polynomials with coefficients in the ring of symmetric polynomials that have been studied by e.g. Stanley, Brenti, Stembridge and Shareshian-Wachs.</description>

Abstract: A graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most four times has at most $6(n-2)$ edges -- this result proven by Ackerman is outstanding in the literature of beyond-planar graphs with regard to its tightness and the structural complexity of the graph class. We provide a much shorter proof while at the same time relaxing the conditions on the graph and its embedding, i.e., allowing multi-edges and non-simple drawings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and efficient random sampling of directed ordered acyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are directed graphs in which there is no path from a vertex to itself. DAGs are an omnipresent data structure in computer science and the problem of counting the DAGs of given number of vertices and to sample them uniformly at random has been solved respectively in the 70's and the 00's. In this paper, we propose to explore a new variation of this model where DAGs are endowed with an independent ordering of the out-edges of each vertex, thus allowing to model a wide range of existing data structures. We provide efficient algorithms for sampling objects of this new class, both with or without control on the number of edges, and obtain an asymptotic equivalent of their number. We also show the applicability of our method by providing an effective algorithm for the random generation of classical labelled DAGs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges, based on a similar approach. This is the first known algorithm for sampling labelled DAGs with full control on the number of edges, and it meets a need in terms of applications, that had already been acknowledged in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Model for a Generic Three-Jug Puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic three-jug puzzle asks, given three jugs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with fixed maximum capacities, with jug $A$ filled with wine to its maximum capacity, whether is it possible to divide the wine into two halves by pouring it from one jug to another without using any other measuring devices. However, we consider a generic version of the three-jug puzzle and present an independent graph-theoretic model to determine whether the puzzle has a solution at all. If it has a solution, then the same can be determined using this model. We also present the sketch of an algorithm to determine the solution of the puzzle.</description>

      <title>Partition-theoretic model of prime distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that naturally predicts the prime number theorem as well as the twin prime conjecture. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$
  where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)$ is an explicit error term that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error term represent enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error term to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\operatorname{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimates are {\it almost exact}.
  We then perform computational tests of unusual predictions of the model, finding limited evidence of predictable variations in prime gaps.</description>

      <title>Square-free powers of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ denote the $k^{\text{th}}$ square-free power of the facet ideal of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ in a polynomial ring $R$. Square-free powers are intimately related to the `Matching Theory' and `Ordinary Powers'. In this article, we show that if $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest, then $R/I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ is Cohen-Macaulay for all $k\ge 1$. This result is quite interesting since all ordinary powers of a graded radical ideal can never be Cohen-Macaulay unless it is a complete intersection. To prove the result, we introduce a new combinatorial notion called special leaf, and using this, we provide an explicit combinatorial formula of $\mathrm{depth}(R/I(\Delta)^{[k]})$ for all $k\ge 1$, where $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest. As an application, we show that the normalized depth function of a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest is nonincreasing.</description>

      <title>The connectivity carcass of a vertex subset in a graph: both odd and even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted multi-graph and $S\subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices. A set of edges with the least cardinality whose removal disconnects $S$, that is, there is no path between at least one pair of vertices from $S$, is called a Steiner mincut for $S$ or simply an $S$-mincut. Connectivity Carcass is a compact data structure storing all $S$-mincuts in $G$ announced by Dinitz and Vainshtein in an extended abstract by Dinitz and Vainshtein in 1994. The complete proof of various results of this data structure for the simpler case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is odd appeared in the year 2000 in SICOMP. Over the last couple of decades, there have been attempts towards the proof for the case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is even, but none of them met a logical end. We present the following results.
  - We present the first complete, self-contained exposition of the connectivity carcass which covers both even and odd cases of the capacity of $S$-mincut.
  - We derive the results using an alternate and much simpler approach. In particular, we derive the results using submodularity of cuts -- a well-known property of graphs expressed using a simple inequality.
  - We also show how the connectivity carcass can be helpful in efficiently answering some basic queries related to $S$-mincuts using some additional insights.</description>

Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if a tile in $\mathbb Z^d$ has prime size $p$, then it must be spectral. The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups. In addition, with a simple transformation we prove that any $p$ points in general linear positions in $\mathbb Z^d$ must be both tiling and spectral if $d\ge p-1$.</description>

      <title>Cofinal families of finite VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given infinite cardinals $\theta\leq \kappa$, we ask for the minimal VC-dimension of a cofinal family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq[\kappa]^{&lt;\theta}$. We show that for $\theta=\omega$ and $\kappa=\aleph_n$ it is consistent with ZFC that there exists such a family of VC-dimension $n+1$, which is known to be the lower bound. For $\theta&gt;\omega$ we answer this question completely, demonstrating a strong dichotomy between the case of singular and regular $\theta$. We furthermore answer some relative and generalized versions of the above question for singular $\theta$, and answer a related question which appears in \cite{BBNKS}.</description>

      <title>Exact structures and maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories for modules over type $A$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties.
  On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\operatorname{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data.
  We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\operatorname{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\operatorname{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</description>

      <title>Torus Actions on Matrix Schubert and Kazhdan-Lusztig Varieties, and their Links to Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the toric geometry of two families of generalised determinantal varieties arising from permutations: Matrix Schubert varieties ($\overline{X_w}$) and Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties ($\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$). Matrix Schubert varieties can be written as $\overline{X_w} = Y_w \times \mathbb C^d$, where $d$ is maximal. We are especially interested in the structure and complexity of these varieties $Y_w$ and $\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$ under the so-called usual torus actions. In the case when $Y_w$ is toric, we provide a full characterisation of the simple reflections $s_i$ that render ${Y_{w \cdot s_i}}$ toric, as well as the corresponding changes to the weight cone. For Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, we consider how moving one of the two permutations $v,w$ along a chain in the Bruhat poset affects their complexity. Additionally, we study the complexity of these varieties, for permutations $v$ and $w$ of a specific structure. Finally, we consider the links between these determinantal varieties and two classes of statistical models; namely conditional independence and quasi-independence models.</description>
