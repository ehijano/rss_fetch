      <title>Pro-nilpotently extended dgca-s and SH Lie-Rinehart pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category of pro-nilpotently extended differential graded commutative algebras is introduced. Chevalley-Eilenberg construction provides an equivalence between its certain full subcategory and the opposite to the full subcategory of strong homotopy Lie Rinehart pairs with strong homotopy morphisms, consisting of pairs $(A,M)$ where $M$ is flat as a graded $A$-module. It is shown that pairs $(A,M)$, where $A$ is a semi-free dgca and $M$ a cell complex in $\op{Mod}(A)$, form a category of fibrant objects by proving that their Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes form a category of cofibrant objects.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced in \cite{Spivak09} about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to dimension reduction (manifold learning) and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions to put the corresponding theory on a more solid footing. A generalization of the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$ will allow us to view the adjunctions used in both publications as special cases. Moreover, we derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$ and the realization functor $\text{Re}:\mathbf{sFuz}\to\mathbf{UM}$, as well as rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that $\mathbf{UM}$ and the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$ and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. We compare it with UMAP and Isomap and provide explanations for observed differences.</description>

      <title>Strongly A^1-invariant sheaves (after F. Morel)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly (respectively strictly) A1-invariant sheaves are foundational for motivic homotopy theory over fields. They are sheaves of (abelian) groups on the Nisnevich site of smooth varieties over a field k, with the property that their zeroth and first Nisnevich cohomology sets (respectively all Nisnevich cohomology groups) are invariant under replacing a variety X by the affine line over X. A celebrated theorem of Fabien Morel states that if the base field k is perfect, then any strongly A1-invariant sheaf of abelian groups is automatically strictly A1-invariant.
  The aim of these lecture notes is twofold: (1) provide a complete proof if this result, and (2) outline some of its applications.</description>

      <title>Categorified Open Topological Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we classify linear categorified open topological field theories in dimension two by pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories. In combination with recently developed string-net techniques, this leads to a new description of the spaces of conformal blocks of Drinfeld centers $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of pivotal finite tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of the modular envelope of the cyclic associative operad. If $\mathcal{C}$ is unimodular, we prove that the space of conformal blocks inherits the structure of a module over the algebra of class functions of $\mathcal{C}$ for every free boundary component. As a further application, we prove that the sewing along a boundary circle for the modular functor for $Z(\mathcal{C})$ can be decomposed into a sewing procedure along an interval and the application of the partial trace. Finally, we construct mapping class group representations from Grothendieck-Verdier categories that are not necessarily rigid and make precise how these generalize existing constructions.</description>

      <title>$ \mathbb{Z}_{2} $- homology of the orbit spaces $ G_{n,2}/ T^{n} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology groups of the orbit space $X_n = G_{n,2}/T^n$ for the canonical action of the compact torus $T^n$ on a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$. Our starting point is the model $(U_n, p_n)$ for $X_n$ constructed by Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2020), where $U_n = \Delta _{n,2}\times \mathcal{F}_{n}$ for a hypersimplex $\Delta_{n,2}$ and an universal space of parameters $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ defined in Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2019), (2020). It is proved by Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2021) that $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ is diffeomorphic to the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ of stable $n$-pointed genus zero curves. We exploit the results from Keel (1992) and Ceyhan (2009) on homology groups of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ and express them in terms of the stratification of $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ which are incorporated in the model $(U_n, p_n)$. In the result we provide the description of cycles in $X_n$, inductively on $ n. $ We obtain as well explicit formulas for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology groups for $X_5$ and $X_6$. The results for $X_5$ recover by different method the results from Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2021) and S\"uss (2020). The results for $X_6$ we consider to be new.</description>

      <title>Magnitude homology equivalence of Euclidean sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude homology is an $\mathbf{R}^+$-graded homology theory of metric spaces that captures information on the complexity of geodesics. Here we address the question: when are two metric spaces magnitude homology equivalent, in the sense that there exist back-and-forth maps inducing mutually inverse maps in homology? We give a concrete geometric necessary and sufficient condition in the case of closed Euclidean sets. Along the way, we introduce the convex-geometric concepts of inner boundary and core, and prove a strengthening for closed convex sets of the classical theorem of Carath\'eodory.</description>

      <title>On the extension problems for the 33-stem homotopy groups of the 6-, 7- and 8-spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the extension problems for the homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the puzzles having remained unsolved for forty-five years. We introduce a tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups, namely, the $\mathcal{Z}$-shape Toda bracket, by which we are able to solve the extension problems with respect to these three homotopy groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of truncated spaces with finite homotopy invariants ($\pi$\=/finite spaces) has many of the features expected of an elementary \oo topos. It should be thought of as the natural higher analogue of the elementary 1-topos of finite sets. We prove several initiality results for this \oo category. The paper has also an appendix about univalent families in \oo pretopoi.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc first studied the topological properties of the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, denoted by $M_n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Later Bj\"{o}rner et al. showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman. We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, which assigns each interval subposet $I$ to a poset morphism $\xi_I \colon Q_I \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $Q_I$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$, and give a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under the total compression system, the value of which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Khovanov homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knot theory is a study of the embedding of closed circles into three-dimensional Euclidean space, motivated the ubiquity of knots in daily life and human civilization. However, the current knot theory focuses on the topology rather than metric. As such, the application of knot theory remains primitive and qualitative. Motivated by the need of quantitative knot data analysis (KDA), this work implements the metric into knot theory, the evolutionary Khovanov homology (EKH), to facilitate a multiscale KDA of real-world data. It is demonstrated that EKH exhibits non-trivial knot invariants at appropriate scales even if the global topological structure of a knot is simple. The proposed EKH has a great potential for KDA and knot learning.</description>
