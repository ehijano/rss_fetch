      <title>Non-traditional C*-diagonals in twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify which conditions on an open normal subgroupoid of a LCH \'etale groupoid with twist are necessary and sufficient for the subgroupoid's reduced twisted C*-algebra to be a C*-diagonal in the ambient groupoid C*-algebra. We do so by first giving an explicit description of the Weyl groupoid and Weyl twist associated to any non-traditional Cartan subalgebra, that is, a Cartan subalgebra that is induced from a non-trivial open normal subgroupoid, as studied in [DWZ2025]. We then combine this description with Kumjian-Renault theory to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions to get a C*-diagonal.</description>

      <title>M*-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces M*-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. M*-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these universal constructions are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Subproduct systems with quantum group symmetry. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete our analysis of the Temperley-Lieb subproduct systems, which define quantum analogues of Arveson's $2$-shift, by extending the main results of the previous paper to the general parameter case. Specifically, we show that the associated Toeplitz algebras are nuclear, find complete sets of relations for them, prove that they are equivariantly $KK$-equivalent to $\mathbb C$ and compute the $K$-theory of the associated Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. A key role is played by quantum symmetry groups, first studied by Mrozinski, preserving Temperley-Lieb polynomials up to rescaling, and their monoidal equivalence to $U_q(2)$.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme contractive completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize a specific quantized convexity structure of the generalized state space of a $C^*$-algebra and examine the associated extreme points. We introduce the notion of $P$-$C^*$-convex subsets, where $P$ is any positive operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. These subsets are defined with in the set of all completely positive (CP) maps from a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ into the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear maps on $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we focus on certain $P$-$C^*$-convex sets, denoted by $\mathrm{CP}^{(P)}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, and analyze their extreme points with respect to this new convexity structure. This generalizes the existing notions of $C^*$-convex subsets and $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps. We significantly extend many of the known results regarding the $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps into the context of $P$-$C^*$-convex sets we are considering. This includes abstract characterization and structure of $P$-$C^*$-extreme points. Further, using these studies, we completely characterize the $C^*$-extreme points of the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive completely positive maps from $\mathcal{A}$ into $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional. Additionally, we discuss the connection between $P$-$C^*$-extreme points and linear extreme points of these convex sets, as well as Krein-Milman type theorems.</description>

      <title>Free denoising via overlap measures and c-freeness techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of free denoising. For free selfadjoint random variables $a,b$, where we interpret $a$ as a signal and $b$ as noise, we find $E(a|a+b)$. To that end, we study a probability measure $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which we call the overlap measure. We show that $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product measure $\mu_a\times \mu_{a+b}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative gives direct access to $E(a|a+b)$. We show that analogous results hold in the case of multiplicative noise when $a,b$ are positive and the aim is to find $E(a|a^{1/2}ba^{1/2})$. In a parallel development we show that, for a general selfadjoint expression $P(a,b)$ made with $a$ and $b$, finding $E(a|P(a,b))$ is equivalent to finding the distribution of $P(a,b)$ in a certain two-state probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\chi)$, where $a,b$ are c-free with respect to $(\varphi,\chi)$ in the sense of Bo\.zejko-Leinert-Speicher. We discuss how free denoising (which is set in the framework of an abstract $W^{*}$-probability space) relates to the notion of ''matrix denoising'' previously discussed in the random matrix literature.</description>
