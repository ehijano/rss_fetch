      <title>Power- and time-dependent equivalent circuit models for waveform-selective metasurfaces with varying electromagnetic responses to repeated pulses at the same frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveform-selective metasurfaces offer unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves on the basis of pulse width. However, existing circuit models fail to capture the power-dependent behaviors of these metasurfaces, thereby limiting their use in practical applications. Here, for the first time, we present analytical equivalent circuit models that accurately predict both power- and time-dependent responses by incorporating voltage-dependent diode resistance through the Maclaurin series and Wright omega functions. As a result, the variations in the input power and time domain are effectively predicted theoretically. Moreover, our concept is successfully extended to different types of waveform-selective metasurfaces and increasingly complex scenarios, including repeated pulses and nonresonant frequencies. Thus, our equivalent circuit approach can readily explain and quantify the electromagnetic behaviors of waveform-selective metasurfaces. This strategy provides a high degree of control for addressing complex electromagnetic problems by leveraging pulse width as a tuning parameter, even at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <title>Potential-based formalism for electrodynamics of media with weak spatial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a potential-based formalism for Maxwell's equations in isotropic media with weak spatial dispersion within the electric quadrupole-magnetic dipole approximation. We introduce an operator form of the constitutive relations along with a modified Lorenz gauge condition, which enables the derivation of decoupled generalized wave equations for electromagnetic potentials. For time-harmonic processes, we derive the representation of general solution for these equations as a combination of solutions to Helmholtz-type equations, whose parameters are determined by both standard and hyper-susceptibilities of the medium. We show that the proposed approach can be extended to more general constitutive relations and it provides a convenient framework for solving various applied problems. Specifically, using a derived closed-form solution for the problem of plane wave incidence on a planar interface, we demonstrate that a correct definition of the Poynting vector within the multipole theory must incorporate quadrupole effects -- an aspect overlooked in some previous works that has led to inconsistent results. We further establish the necessity of accounting for both propagated and evanescent longitudinal components in reflected and transmitted waves. The presence of these components, which follow directly from the general solution for electromagnetic potentials, is essential for satisfying all classical and additional boundary conditions in media with quadrupolar response (e.g., in metamaterials or quadrupolar liquid mixtures). The complete set of these boundary conditions is derived based on the least action principle, ensuring variational consistency with the field equations and generalizing previously known formulations of multipole theory.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry, strong second harmonic generation, and ferroelectricity with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.</description>
