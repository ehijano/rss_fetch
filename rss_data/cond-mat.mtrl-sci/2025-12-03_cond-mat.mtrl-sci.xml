      <title>Neural Networks as Physics-Consistent Surrogates: An \textit{Explainable AI} Validation Framework for Learning Constitutive Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Physics-\textit{Explainable AI} (XAI) framework to validate and interpret neural networks for the constitutive modeling of solid materials. The study bridges the gap between data-driven models and continuum mechanics by applying a suite of explainability methods to neural networks trained on three distinct material behaviors: hyperelasticity (\textit{Mooney-Rivlin}), elastoplasticity (\textit{Chaboche}), and viscoelasticity (\textit{Fractional Zener}). First, high-fidelity surrogate models, including dense feed-forward networks, LSTMs, and GRUs, are trained on synthetically generated data to accurately capture complex material responses. The core of the work then employs XAI techniques to "open the black box" and confirm that the networks learn physically meaningful principles. For hyperelasticity, gradient-based attributions (\textit{Grad Input} (GI)) successfully match the analytical tangent modulus, proving the network learned material stiffness. For elastoplasticity, \textit{SHapley Additive exPlanations} (SHAP) and \textit{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) demonstrate the \textit{Recurrent Neural Network} (RNN) internalizes path-dependent memory, with SHAP identifying \textit{plastic strain} as the dominant feature governing the stress prediction. For viscoelasticity, latent-space and wavelet analyses of the \textit{Gated Recurrent Unit. } GRU layers reveal a clear temporal hierarchy, with different layers encoding instantaneous elastic response, intermediate relaxation, and long-term fractional memory. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the XAI framework can verify that the neural networks are not merely curve-fitting but are, in fact, learning the underlying physical mechanisms of stiffness, history-dependence, and temporal damping.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of carbon incorporation in sulfide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vapor-pressure-mismatched materials, such as transition metal chalcogenides, have emerged as key electronic, photonic, and quantum materials. Hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD) has become a preferred method for epitaxial or textured growth of these materials; however, unintentional carbon (C) incorporation remains a persistent concern, particularly when using organic chalcogen precursors as safer alternatives to toxic hydrides. The mechanisms governing C incorporation and its impact on film growth and properties in hPLD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of C-containing side products generated from organosulfur precursor pyrolysis on ZnS, BaTiS$_3$, and TiS$_2$ thin films grown by hPLD using tert-butyl disulfide (TBDS). Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, combined with secondary ion mass spectrometry, is used to systematically examine the effects of growth temperature and TBDS partial pressure on film morphology, crystallinity, and C incorporation. Optimal growth temperatures of 400{\deg}C, 500{\deg}C, and 700{\deg}C are identified for ZnS, TiS$_2$, and BaTiS$_3$, respectively. Growth above or below these temperatures leads to increased C incorporation at both the interface and within the film, correlating with degraded texture. In contrast, highly textured films exhibit minimal C content, comparable to films grown without TBDS. For TiS$_2$, C incorporation depends strongly on TBDS pressure, with 10$^{-1}$ Pa identified as the optimal pressure for minimizing contamination. At higher pressures, loss of preferential texture is observed, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk. These results provide new insight into process-induced C impurities in hPLD-grown chalcogenide thin films and have important implications for sulfide-based thin film technologies.</description>

      <title>Coupling between ferroelectric distortions and excitonic properties in PbTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PbTiO$_3$ is a ferroelectric perovskite semiconductor with favourable electronic and optical properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including photo-catalysis and (opto)electronic devices. Despite its relevance, an accurate ab-initio description of the optical absorption spectrum and of the impact of ferroelectric distortion on the excitonic properties is still lacking. We combine $G_0W_0$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation calculations to investigate the electronic and optical properties of PbTiO$_3$, tracking the evolution of its excitonic spectrum along the transition from the cubic paraelectric to the tetragonal ferroelectric phase. As the polar distortion increases, the first absorption peak of the cubic phase splits into two distinct features due to symmetry breaking, which partially lifts the degeneracy of the underlying excitonic state. Crucially, the distortion further introduces an in-plane/out-of-plane anisotropy in the spectra and controls the energy separation between the resulting excitonic branches. These findings highlight the potential for tuning the optical absorption properties of PbTiO$_3$ via the application of an external electric field.</description>

      <title>End-to-end machine-learned interatomic potentials for modeling functionalized mesoporous aluminosilicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural hierarchy and chemical flexibility of metallosilicates enable broad technological applications, yet they also make it challenging to uncover structure--property relations. Previous large-scale atomistic simulations have provided mechanistic insight, but their accuracy and achievable model complexity remain constrained by the available interatomic potentials. Here, we present an end-to-end workflow for developing accurate and efficient machine-learning potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials (MTPs), tailored for structurally and chemically complex systems such as metallosilicates. The workflow integrates de novo structure generation, surface functionalization, and property evaluation. A domain-specific training strategy is employed: Configurations associated with melt--quench generation and subsequent functionalization train the syn-MTP, whereas configurations near equilibrium train the eq-MTP. We apply the workflow to prototypical metallosilicates, i.e., aluminosilicates, which we also experimentally synthesize and characterize for benchmarking the simulations. The syn-MTP reliably generates amorphous aluminosilicates that match experimental density and pair distribution functions measured with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The eq-MTP reproduces experimental infrared spectra and surface hydroxyl densities, along with density-functional-theory-derived dehydrogenation energies, demonstrating meta-GGA-level accuracy and validating the end-to-end workflow. Finally, we showcase the applicability of the developed potentials by predicting infrared spectra of functionalized porous aluminosilicates. This study establishes a robust path toward accurate modeling of realistic metallosilicates under operando-relevant conditions.</description>

      <title>Effective Mass of a Migrating Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces in materials are often treated as massless geometric boundaries, and many kinetic models adopt an overdamped assumption. In this Letter, we show that grain boundaries exhibit inertial behavior under high-frequency oscillatory loading and introduce a quantitative method to determine their effective mass from the phase lag between the applied force and interface velocity. The measured effective mass correlates with the mass of atoms participating in interface migration. Using this advance, we reassess prevailing theories and identify regimes where the inertial term materially affects interfacial kinetics, particularly at high frequencies relevant to thermal fluctuations. These results motivate incorporating an effective mass into kinetic descriptions, providing a clearer basis for modeling and interpreting interface migration.</description>

      <title>Coupled plastic strain- and stress-induced phase transformations and microstructure evolution in Fe-7%Mn alloy in dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first experiments in dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell (dRDAC) on severe plastic deformation (SPD) and BCC&lt;-&gt;HCP phase transformation (PT) at pressure up to 27.6 GPa, rotation rates up to 1,500 RPM, and strain rates up to 2,094 /s are performed considering Fe-%7Mn alloy as an example. The BCC-HCP PT initiates at 11.4 GPa under hydrostatic loading while it is 3.2 GPa under plastic compression. Strong effect of plastic straining leads to unique kinetics with simultaneous direct and reverse PTs, not studied for any material. For quasi-static loading, parameters in the kinetics for the strain-induced direct-reverse PTs and stationary volume fraction versus pressure are found. During torsion with 1,000 and 1,500 RPM, volume fraction of the HCP phase does not change. After torsion stops, it increases by 30% within a few minutes after 1,000 RPM and HCP phase disappears after 1,500 RPM. These findings contradict general wisdom that strain-induced PTs occur only during straining, time is not a governing parameter, and kinetics is determined by plastic strain instead of time. Thus, nuclei of the HCP phase are generated during straining at high strain rate, but growth/disappearance occur under stresses at much longer time scales. Consequently, a new theory of combined strain- and stress-induced PTs is required. The following important rule is revealed: crystallite size of 30 nm, microstrain ~0.004, and dislocation density ~1.1 x $10^{15}$/$m^2$ in the HCP phase are steady during static compression and dynamic torsion, during and after the PT and after torsion. These parameters are independent of pressure, plastic strain tensor, its path, strain rates, and volume fraction of the HCP phase. Obtained results open fundamental research on combined strain- and stress-induced PTs and microstructure evolution under dynamic SPD and high pressure.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multifractality to Enhance Thermal Stability in Mixed-Phase Vanadium Oxide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium oxide thin films exhibit temperature-driven electronic transitions desirable for sensing and microelectronic applications, yet their performance is often limited by thermal hysteresis. This study demonstrates that electronic stability is governed not simply by roughness or crystallinity but by a unique combination of surface morphological complexity and thermal hysteresis, revealed across films deposited with varying working pressure using Direct Current/Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering. Specifically, the film grown at 15 mTorr shows a distinct convergence of highest morphological vertical complexity and lowest thermal hysteresis, exhibiting nearly reversible transport with activation energies ranging from 0.26 to 0.28 eV and negative temperature coefficients of resistance between -0.0337 and -0.035 K-1. While conventional roughness metrics and mono-fractal parameters do not capture this behavior, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis uncovers a pronounced peak in multifractality strength, which correlates inversely with thermal hysteresis. This highlights multifractality strength as a predictive descriptor of electronic stability, identifying a multiscale structural signature that enhances stress accommodation during thermal cycling. These results define an optimal deposition window and provide a morphology-guided pathway for developing thermally robust mixed-phase vanadium oxide films.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature thermal conductivity of the substrate material YAlO3 and its unconventional sister compound YbAlO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present thermal conductivity data on single crystals of YAlO3 and YbAlO3 for temperatures between 2 K and 300 K and the heat current along b and c. Both materials are very good thermal conductors in the investigated temperature range. The thermal conductivity in these electrical insulators is due to phonons. The effect of Y-Yb exchange is found to be rather small despite the considerable difference in density and average atomic mass. For YAlO3 we find a moderate thermal conductivity anisotropy with weak temperature dependence and a ratio of c to b direction between at most 1 and 2.2. It is discussed with regard to the velocities of sound and relevant scattering processes. For YbAlO3 the small crystal size limits the precision of absolute thermal conductivity values and does not allow drawing conclusions on the anisotropy. Our results on YAlO3 confirm that the material is suitable for applications requiring a good thermal conductivity at temperatures down to liquid helium, such as lasers, substrates, and detectors.</description>

      <title>Framework for Electrochemical &amp; Electrical Energy Storage Materials Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several electrochemical and electrical energy storage devices are reported every day, with the claim of outperforming the established ones. The use of newer materials and recent advanced techniques to synthesize and/or assemble them into a device leads to improved performance. Cyclic stability of a device is the most effective way of assessing the performance of the device. A wide variety of parameters can influence the cyclic stability of a cell, and there is no single fundamental parameter that reliably captures or assesses its overall performance. Therefore, we developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework that could account for various parameters like various types of materials used, selected fabrication techniques, current density, operating voltage window, temperature, environment, and other conditions, and can effectively rank cell performance based on essential assessment metrics like specific capacity and energy density that are substantial for a well-founded comparison.
  The framework is designed with 45+ fields that capture various details related to i) materials used to fabricate cells, ii) processing techniques associated with electrode preparation and cell assembly, iii) cell information like weights and volumes, iv) electrochemical testing parameters, and v) cyclic charge-discharge performance details of a cell. The framework also accommodates charge-discharge gravimetric specific capacity, which is believed to be a key asset in accurately extracting lots of useful information, such as specific capacity, energy density, quantum efficiency, and other efficiencies. A distinctive feature of the framework is its ability to store data from both experimental and theoretical/computational sources (such as DFT and ML predictions) and facilitate effective comparison between them.</description>

      <title>Strengthening and toughening mechanisms in heterostructured laminates revealed by a phase field-enhanced crystal plasticity simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructured (HS) materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties, combining high strength and significant ductility. Hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) hardening and strain de-localization are key to their strength-ductility synergy. However, existing models often fall short in addressing these aspects. In this work, a coupled framework integrating strain gradient crystal plasticity and phase field damage models is developed. The interface dominated HDI hardening in HS laminates is handled by introducing a heterogeneity coefficient into the back stress. The phase field model accounts for defect energy-driven damage and accurately represents the materials ductile damage behavior by accounting for effects of microstructure on crack initiation and propagation. Simulation results on HS laminates align well with experimental results and reflect the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations and back stresses at interfaces between regions with dissimilar microstructure. Crack initiation and propagation are accurately described, providing valuable insights into fracture behavior. The model can predict how strength and ductility change upon variations of the HS laminate microstructure, thus providing an essential tool for microstructure optimization. This work enhances the understanding of deformation mechanisms in HS laminates and provides valuable insights for design and optimization of this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Gate Leakage Currents in SiC Power MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs) enable high-voltage and high-temperature power conversion. Compared to Si devices, they suffer from pronounced gate leakage due to the reduced electron tunneling barrier at the interface between SiC and amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO$_2$). We develop a self-consistent, physics-based simulation framework that couples electrostatics, quantum tunneling, carrier transport, impact ionization, and charge trapping for both electrons and holes. The model quantitatively reproduces measured gate-current-voltage characteristics of SiC MOS capacitors over a wide temperature (80-573 K) range and a wide bias range without empirical fitting. Simulations reveal that conduction electrons in a-SiO$_2$ can trigger impact ionization, which generates electron-hole pairs, and leads to capture of holes in the oxide bulk, thereby enhancing gate leakage current. The framework captures these coupled processes across multiple orders of magnitude in time and field, providing predictive capability for oxide reliability. Although demonstrated for SiC devices, the methodology also applies to Si technologies that uses the same gate dielectric.</description>

      <title>Precise Twist Angle Determination in twisted WSe2 via Optical Moir\'e Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) form moir\'e superlattices resulting in moir\'e minibands in momentum space and hosting localized excitons in real space. While moir\'e superlattices provide access to Mott-Hubbard physics, their energy potential landscape and electronic correlations are highly sensitive to fluctuations of the twist angle, disorder and lattice reconstructions. However, fast and non-invasive experimental access to local twist angle and its spatial variations is challenging. Here, we systematically correlate twist angle variations of twisted WSe2 bilayers across micrometer length scales using a combined lateral force microscopy (LFM) and a micro- Raman spectroscopy approach. These measurements uncover lateral variations in the twist angle by more than 1{\deg} across length scales relevant to optical and transport measurements. We demonstrate that twist angles in the range of 3{\deg} &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 12{\deg} show distinct Raman response from scattering on optical moir\'e phonons allowing twist angle determination with high precision and sub-micrometer spatial resolution under ambient conditions. These modes are particularly sensitive in the low-angle twist regime, predicted to host emergent quantum phases. Our results establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moir\'e phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe to determine twist angle and to screen local twist angle variations with a precision better than $\pm$ 0.3{\deg} and a lateral resolution below one micrometer. This methodology is also applicable to fully hBN-encapsulated heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field and Doping-Induced Non collinear Magnetic Interactions in Monolayer Ti$_2$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) silicides are an emerging class of materials whose magnetic and relativistic properties remain largely unexplored. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how electric-field modulation and transition-metal doping influence the magnetic exchange, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in monolayer Ti2Si. Pristine Ti2Si is a dynamically stable ferromagnetic metal with in-plane anisotropy and centrosymmetric bonding, which suppresses DMI even under strong perpendicular electric fields. To overcome this symmetry constraint, we introduce Pt and Co substitution at Ti sites. Co enhances the magnetic exchange, whereas Pt provides strong spin orbit coupling (SOC), and the combined chemical asymmetry breaks inversion symmetry sufficiently to induce a sizable DMI. A Wannier-based tight-binding model captures the orbital-resolved superexchange pathways and reveals a clear hierarchy between a weak Si-mediated channel and a dominant Pt-mediated interlayer channel. First-principles calculations confirm that the Pt-assisted pathway governs the magnitude and sign of the total DMI. Among all configurations, Pt0.5CoTi0.5Si exhibits the strongest chiral interaction, with its intralayer and interlayer contributions favoring opposite rotation senses, namely counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). Our results establish chemically engineered Ti2Si monolayers as a promising platform for realizing and tuning chiral magnetic textures in 2D silicides.</description>

      <title>Competing excitonic couplings as origin of mimicked phase transitions in zinc-phthalocyanine single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of molecular crystals are largely determined by the excitonic coupling of neighboring molecules. This coupling is extremely sensitive to the arrangement of adjacent molecular units, as their electronic interaction is defined by the relative orientation of the individual transition dipole moments and their wave function overlap. Hence, the optical properties, such as fluorescence, are usually highly anisotropic and good indicators of structural changes during the variation of intensive thermodynamic parameters like temperature or pressure. Here, we discuss the peculiar though archetypical case of $\beta$-phase zinc-phthalocyanine: In single crystals, we report a sudden change of spectral emission with temperature from a broad, unpolarized Frenkel-exciton type luminescence to a narrow, highly polarized superradiance-like fluorescence below 80 K. Surprisingly, we find that there is no sign of a discrete structural phase transition in this temperature regime. To understand this apparent contradiction, we perform polarization-, temperature- and time-dependent photoluminescence measurements along different crystallographic directions to fully map the emission characteristics of the crystal-exciton. By means of ab-initio calculations on a density functional theory level we conclude that our observations are consistent with a dimer exciton model when considering thermalized electronic states. As such, our study presents a representative case study on a well-established molecular material class demonstrating that caution is advised when attributing discrete changes in electronic observables to a structural phase transition. As we show for zinc-phthalocyanine in its $\beta$-phase modification, slowly varying excitonic couplings and thermal redistribution of excitations can mimic the same signatures attributed to a structural phase transition.</description>

      <title>Rational regulation strategies of interstitial localized electrons in electride: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a class of electron-rich materials, electrides demonstrate promising applications in many fields. However, the required high pressure restricts the practical applications to some extent. This study reveals that the unique feature of electride, i.e., the localization of interstitial electrons, can be greatly enhanced and tuned by self-defective doping, applying tensile/compressive stress, or shear stress. Moreover, the requirement of orbital orthogonality between the valence and core electron wave functions, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, should be the driven force for the electron interstitial localization; and the exertion of external pressure modifies the available space to accommodate the electronic wave functions, thus enhances the interstitial localization. These discoveries lay down the ground for searching for promising electrides that are practicable at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Anti-Stokes Luminescence Thermometry in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate temperature mapping at the nanoscale is a critical challenge in modern science and technology, as conventional methods fail at these dimensions. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a highly sensitive nanothermometer using anti-Stokes photoluminescence, also known as photoluminescence upconversion (UPL), in monolayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Leveraging the direct band gap and strong exciton-phonon coupling in the two-dimensional monolayers, we achieve an exceptional relative sensitivity above $4\%\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ across the 300 K to 425 K range, ranking it among the best-performing materials reported. A strong resonantly enhanced UPL is observed, confirming the central role of optical phonons in the upconversion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new analytical model to quantitatively describe the UPL process, taking into account the interplay of phonon populations, bandgap narrowing, and substrate effects, which predicts resonant temperatures and provides a framework with broad applicability to any material exhibiting an anti-Stokes photoluminescence response. To demonstrate its use as a high-resolution optical thermometer, we map a $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thermal gradient across a $20\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ long monolayer with a spatial resolution of $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. With its high sensitivity, strong signal, and excellent reproducibility, our work establishes monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide as a leading platform for non-invasive thermal sensing in advanced microelectronic and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of polytype heterostructures via delicate structural transitions from a doped-Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host multiple competing structural and electronic phases, making them an ideal platform for constructing polytype heterostructures with emergent quantum properties. However, controlling phase transitions to form diverse heterostructures inside a single crystal remains challenging. Here, we realize vertical/lateral polytype heterostructures in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPM) confirm the coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures. Atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements reveal the transparent effect in 1H/1T vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying 1T-layer superposes on the top 1H-layer under positive bias. By systematically comparing 1T/1H and 1T/1T interfaces, we demonstrate that the metallic 1H-layer imposes a Coulomb screening effect on the 1T-layer, suppressing the formation of CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states. These results clarify the interfacial coupling between distinct quantum many-body phases and establish a controllable pathway for constructing two-dimensional polytype heterostructures with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic Nature of Spinel Oxides: A Review of Their Electron Interactions and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review discusses the multifaceted electronic properties of spinel oxides with a particular focus on Lithium Vanadate (LiV2O4), Lithium Titanate (LiTi2O4), and Magnesium Titanate (MgTi2O4). We selected LiTi2O4, LiV2O4, and MgTi2O4 because they serve as quintessential examples of spinel oxides' diverse and intriguing electronic phenomena. LiV2O4 heavy fermion behaviour challenges traditional theories in d-electron systems, LiTi2O4 being the first oxide superconductor provides critical insights into unconventional superconductivity driven by strong electron-phonon interactions, and MgTi2O4 pronounced orbital ordering and metalinsulator transition offers a clear model for exploring electron-lattice coupling. This shows how the inherent structural versatility of the spinel lattice, characterised by its cubic close-packed oxygen network and variable cation distributions, enables a rich interplay of electron-electron correlations, electron-lattice coupling, and orbital degrees of freedom. In LiV2O4, the combination of mixed-valence vanadium ions and a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice gives rise to heavy fermion behaviour, whereas LiTi2O4 exhibits unconventional superconductivity driven by a high density of states at the Fermi level and strong electronphonon interactions. MgTi2O4 undergoes a pronounced metal-insulator transition, where orbital ordering triggers a Peierls-like distortion that stabilises a low-temperature insulating state through Ti-Ti dimerization. How the composition of these compounds affects their properties, based on both theoretical research and experimental findings, is illustrated by this review. It illustrates the promise of Spinels in practical technologies such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and high-temperature lubrication.</description>

      <title>Intervention Strategies for Polarization Switching in Hybrid Improper Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of hybrid improper ferroelectrics (HIFs) in electronic and spintronic devices hinges on their ability to switch polarization. Although the coupling between octahedral rotation and tilt is well established, the factors that govern switching barriers remain elusive. In this study, we explore this area to demonstrate the critical role of causal reasoning in uncovering the mechanisms to control the ferroelectric switching barrier in HIFs. By combining causal discovery, causal interventions, and first-principles simulations, we identify tolerance factor, A-site cation radii mismatch, epitaxial strain, and octahedral rotation/tilt as key parameters and quantify how their interplay directly influences switching barrier. Three key insights emerge from our work: (a) the analysis identifies the structural descriptors controlling polarization reversal across a broad family of A-site-layered double perovskites and superlattices, (b) it uncovers non-trivial, material-specific rotation-tilt mechanisms, including a counterintuitive cooperative pathway where both rotation and tilt change while lowering the barrier, an effect mostly inaccessible to conventional Landau or first-principles-based approaches and (c) it maps these material-specific mechanisms to experimentally realizable parameters, showing that epitaxial strain from orthorhombic substrates (e.g., NdScO$_3$, NdGaO$_3$) selectively tunes octahedral distortions to achieve barrier reduction across varied compositions. These results establish actionable, materials-by-design principles linking composition, structure, and strain to polarization switching, while highlighting the potential of causal reasoning to guide intelligent, mechanism-driven strategies for engineering complex functional oxides.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field induced polarization enhancement in the photoluminescence of MBE-grown WSe$_2$ layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic-field dependence of the optically pumped valley polarization in an epitaxial tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that applying a weak out-of-plane magnetic field, on the order of 0.1 T, dramatically increases the effectiveness of the optical orientation of the emission associated with defect-bound localized excitons. We compare the obtained results with the earlier studies on the reference exfoliated monolayers, discussing both qualitative similarity as well as quantitative differences. Our observations are further supplemented by the results of time-resolved PL measurements, which confirm the pseudospin relaxation time of approximately 25 ps, a value significantly shorter than the $\approx$100 ps previously reported for mechanically exfoliated samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning has enabled the rapid prediction of inorganic materials with novel properties, the challenge of determining how to synthesize these materials remains largely unsolved. Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>New insights into hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in nickel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the grain boundary (GB) susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in pure nickel as a function of coincident site lattice value ($\Sigma$-n), over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (4 to 14 wppm). Cracks on the surface and within the bulk material were identified across the entire gauge region of the specimens. The susceptibility of GBs to crack initiation and propagation was evaluated by separating cracks containing single GB or multiple GBs. A larger loss in fracture strain, a smaller reduction in area, and an increase in the percentage of intergranular fracture indicated a higher degree of embrittlement at elevated hydrogen concentrations. The number of cracks was significantly higher on the surface than in the bulk for the most severe hydrogen charging conditions ($\geq$ 8 wppm), while a similar number was observed for lower concentrations. The propensity for hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking at different types of GBs on the surface and in the bulk material was consistent, indicating that while cathodic charging can promote surface cracks, it does not significantly impact the GBs relative susceptibility. The $\Sigma$-3 boundaries were the most resistant to cracking, as evidenced by the considerably lower fraction of these GBs exhibiting intergranular cracking at all hydrogen concentrations considered. This contrasts literature findings for Ni alloys and can be explained by the segregation energies and reductions in the cohesive strength with hydrogen, with less favorable trapping at the $\Sigma$-3 boundaries. No evidence of plasticity-mediated cracking initiation was observed.</description>

      <title>Learning interpretable surface elasticity properties from bulk properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface elasticity is central to understanding the mechanics and stability of surfaces and interfaces. It is characterized by quantities such as surface tension, residual surface stress, and surface stiffness, however their analytical expressions are typically difficult to derive from atomistic data, and depend strongly on modeling choices. This work presents a neural network-based equation learner which combines customized activation functions and connection-based pruning to discover parsimonious, closed-form equations for surface elasticity from atomistic simulations. Applying the method to seven face centered cubic (FCC) metals, our equation learner uncovers interpretable equations that describe both low-Miller index and high-Miller index surface properties, capturing long-tail property distributions accurately. The discovered expressions are decoupled into two components: a universal, geometry-driven orientation function, and material-specific baseline coefficients. We find that lower-order properties such as surface tension are fundamentally geometry dependent, while higher-order properties such as surface stress and elasticity show more complex geometry and material dependence. We also relate material dependent coefficients to bulk properties, forming a clear map from bulk material properties to surface elasticity. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable neurosymbolic machine learning can bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and physical laws, enabling the discovery of generalizable structure-property relationships for materials science phenomena such as surface elasticity.</description>

      <title>Accurate prediction of macroscopic transport from microscopic imaging via critical fractals at the Mott transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent refractive index of AlGaAs for quantum-photonic devices near the bandgap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental method to determine the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ (x = 0.0 - 0.5) from 300 K to 4 K across the 500 - 1100 nm wavelength range. The values are extracted from spectroscopically observed microcavity resonances in thin $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ membranes embedded between fully and partially reflective gold mirrors. Refined Varshni and Paessler models are used to describe temperature-dependent bandgap shifts and material composition. By tracking resonance shifts and benchmarking against finite-difference time-domain simulations, we derive the dispersive optical response with high precision. This yields a quantitatively improved analytical expression for the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ matching the experimental results with a coefficient of determination as high as $R^2=0.993$, enabling accurate modeling near the band edge at cryogenic temperatures. The method is straightforward and broadly applicable to other semiconductor systems, offering a valuable tool for the design of micro photonic devices such as quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in the mixed valence polyoxovanadate cage V$_{12}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Entropy as Information - A compression-based demonstration of the Shannon-Boltzmann equivalence in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Shannon's information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy of Boltzmann and Gibbs are quantitatively equivalent for real condensed-matter systems. By interpreting atomic configurations as information sources, we compute entropy directly from the compressibility of molecular-dynamics trajectories, without physical partitioning or empirical modeling. A custom lossy-compression algorithm measures the minimum number of bits required to describe a microstate at finite precision, and this bit count maps exactly to thermodynamic entropy through the Shannon-Boltzmann relation. The method reproduces benchmark entropies for metals, semiconductors, oxides, and refractory ceramics in both solid and liquid phases, establishing information as the fundamental quantity underlying thermodynamic disorder. This equivalence unifies information theory and statistical mechanics, providing a general and computationally efficient framework for determining entropies and free energies directly from atomic data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady electron-excitonic complexes coupling in a two-dimensional semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interac- tion mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two- dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of elec- tronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Emergent Chiral Spin Crystal Phase in (111) SrRuO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Inverse Identification of Interfacial Heat Conduction in Finite Layer and Semi-Infinite Substrate Systems via a Physics-Guided Neural Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hydrogels with spatiotemporal stiffening using pH-modulating enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive material systems that autonomously respond to external stimuli are crucial for advancing next-generation smart devices. Biological systems achieve autonomous behavior by utilizing chemical energy from out-of-equilibrium reactions to power life-like functions without requiring external energy inputs. Although responsive hydrogels with embedded enzymatic reactions offer a promising platform for implementing adaptive behavior in synthetic systems, previous studies have focused on controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of responsive building blocks rather than modulating network crosslinking. Here, we demonstrate direct enzymatic modulation of crosslinking density in a double-network hydrogel to achieve autonomous self-stiffening in response to a chemical stimulus. Our adaptive system embeds glucose oxidase within a polyacrylamide-alginate double-network hydrogel containing Ca(EDTA)2- complexes that render the crosslinked alginate network pH-responsive through a competitive calcium binding mechanism. Chemical waves emerging from enzymatic reaction activation propagate at speeds ranging from 15 to 44 um/min, driving spatiotemporal mechanical transitions that increase material stiffness by up to 2.1-fold. By integrating signal sensing and chemomechanical transduction within this responsive hydrogel, we realized adaptive behavior that autonomously converts localized chemical inputs into system-wide mechanical outputs. This positions our adaptive hydrogels as promising model systems to guide the design of intelligent materials for soft robotics and biomedical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second-Order Topological Superconductors with Tunable Majorana Zero Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(\pi,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,\pi)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.</description>

      <title>Autonomous thermodynamically informed database generation for machine-learned interatomic potentials and application to magnesium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for constructing training databases for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential (MLIP) models, specifically designed to capture phase properties across a wide range of conditions. The framework is uniquely appealing due to its ease of automation, its suitability for iterative learning, and its independence from prior knowledge of stable phases, avoiding bias towards pre-existing structural data. The approach uses Nested Sampling (NS) to explore the configuration space and generate thermodynamically relevant configurations, forming the database which undergoes ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) evaluation. We use the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) architecture to fit a model on the resulting database. To demonstrate the efficiency of the framework, we apply it to magnesium, developing a model capable of accurately describing behaviour across pressure and temperature ranges of 0-600 GPa and 0-8000 K, respectively. We benchmark the model's performance by calculating phonon spectra and elastic constants, as well as the pressure-temperature phase diagram within this region. The results showcase the power of the framework to produce robust MLIPs while maintaining transferability and generality, for reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering in Moir\'e Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, however, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop an approach to incorporate short-ranged Hubbard interactions self-consistently in a continuum model. In addition, we include long-ranged Coulomb interactions, which are known to be important when doping the flat bands of tBLG and tTLG. Therefore, for the first time, magnetic order in moir\'e graphene multilayers is self-consistently explored in a continuum model with atomistic detail. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. Our results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we investigated magnetic order of tTLG, which were found to be similar to those in tBLG. In the future, the developed continuum model can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moir\'e graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.</description>

      <title>Dimension- and Facet-Dependent Altermagnetic Biferroics and Ferromagnetic Biferroics and Triferroics in CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address {\sl stability} as fulfillment of the {\sc Hill} condition -- i.e.\ the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the {\sc Kirchhoff} stress -- log--strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of attosecond tunnel ionization competes with disorder-driven decoherence in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a strong-field phenomenon that is sensitive to the attosecond dynamics of tunnel ionization and coherent transport of electron-hole pairs in solids. While the foundations of solid HHG have been established, a deep understanding into the nature of decoherence on sub-cycle timescales remains elusive. Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (&gt;250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric topology: the rope weaving in parameter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of elasto-optical properties of $R$Te$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides ($R$Te$_3$) exhibit complex charge-density-wave (CDW) phases intertwined with lattice symmetry, offering a platform to explore unconventional symmetry breaking in correlated materials. Elasto-optical probing, which detects strain-induced changes in birefringence, provides a non-invasive approach to visualize anisotropy and emergent order in these quasi-two-dimensional systems. However, the magnitude and symmetry of the expected optical response remain poorly quantified, hindering experimental interpretation. Here, we perform first-principles calculations of the elastic, dielectric, and piezo-optical tensors of NdTe$_3$ to establish a quantitative framework for strain-induced optical anisotropy. These results establish a quantitative link between lattice strain and optical response in $R$Te$_3$, providing a predictive framework for probing symmetry-breaking states via elasto-birefringence.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

      <title>Spin current symmetries generated by GdFeCo ferrimagnet across its magnetisation compensation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.</description>
