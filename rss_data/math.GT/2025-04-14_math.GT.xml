      <title>A piecewise-linear isometrically immersed flat Klein bottle in Euclidean 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical polyhedron data for the image of a piecewise-linear map from a zero-curvature Klein bottle into Euclidean 3-space such that every point in the domain has a neighborhood which is isometrically embedded. To the author's knowledge, this is the first explicit piecewise-smooth isometric immersion of a flat Klein bottle. Intuitively, the surface can be locally made from origami and but for the self-intersections has the global topology of a Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of uniformly random permutation representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. Consider the composition of a uniformly random element of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,S_n)$ with the $(n-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_n$. We prove the strong convergence in probability as $n\to\infty$ of this sequence of random representations to the regular representation of $\Gamma$.
  As a consequence, for any closed hyperbolic surface $X$, with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ covering space of $X$ has near optimal relative spectral gap -- ignoring the eigenvalues that arise from the base surface $X$.
  To do so, we show that the polynomial method of proving strong convergence can be extended beyond rational settings.
  To meet the requirements of this extension we prove two new kinds of results. First, we show there are effective polynomial approximations of expected values of traces of elements of $\Gamma$ under random homomorphisms to $S_n$. Secondly, we estimate the growth rates of probabilities that a finitely supported random walk on $\Gamma$ is a proper power after a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>Real Heegaard Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an invariant of three-manifolds with an involution with non-empty fixed point set of codimension $2$; in particular, this applies to double branched covers over knots. Our construction gives the Heegaard Floer analogue of Li's real monopole Floer homology. It is a special case of a real version of Lagrangian Floer homology, which may be of independent interest to symplectic geometers. The Euler characteristic of the real Heegaard Floer homology is the analogue of Miyazawa's invariant, and can be computed combinatorially for all knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guo and Luo introduced generalized circle patterns on surfaces and proved their rigidity. In this paper, we prove the existence of Guo-Luo's generalized circle patterns with prescribed generalized intersection angles on surfaces with cusps, which partially answers a question raised by Guo-Luo and generalizes Bobenko-Springborn's hyperbolic circle patterns on closed surfaces to generalized hyperbolic circle patterns on surfaces with cusps. We further introduce the combinatorial Ricci flow and combinatorial Calabi flow for generalized circle patterns on surfaces with cusps, and prove the longtime existence and convergence of the solutions for these combinatorial curvature flows.</description>

      <title>Algebraic invariants of multi-virtual links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-virtual knot theory was introduced in $2024$ by the first author. In this paper, we initiate the study of algebraic invariants of multi-virtual links. After determining a generating set of (oriented) multi-virtual Reidemeister moves, we discuss the equivalence of multi-virtual link diagrams, particularly those that have the same virtual projections. We introduce operator quandles (that is, quandles with a list of pairwise commuting automorphisms) and construct an infinite family of connected operator quandles in which at least one third of right translations are distinct and pairwise commute. Using our set of generating moves, we establish the operator quandle coloring invariant and the operator quandle $2$-cocycle invariant for multi-virtual links, generalizing the well-known invariants for classical links. With these invariants at hand, we then classify certain small multi-virtual knots based on the existing tables of small virtual knots due to Bar-Natan and Green. Finally, to emphasize a key difference between virtual and multi-virtual knots, we construct an infinite family of pairwise nonequivalent multi-virtual knots, each with a single classical crossing. Many open problems are presented throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Some arithmetic aspects of ortho-integral surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ortho-integral (OI) hyperbolic surfaces with totally geodesic boundaries, defined by the property that every orthogeodesic (i.e. a geodesic arc meeting the boundary perpendicularly at both endpoints) has an integer cosh-length. We prove that while only finitely many OI surfaces exist for any fixed topology, infinitely many commensurability classes arise as the topology varies. Moreover, we completely classify OI pants and OI one-holed tori, and show that their doubles are arithmetic surfaces of genus 2 derived from quaternion algebras over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Bolza-like surfaces in the Thurston set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surface in the Teichm\"uller space, where the systole function admits its maximum, is called a maximal surface. For genus two, a unique maximal surface exists, which is called the Bolza surface, whose systolic geodesics give a triangulation of the surface. We define a surface as Bolza-like if its systolic geodesics decompose the surface into $(p, q, r)$-triangles for some integers $p,q,r$. In this article, we will provide a construction of Bolza-like surfaces for infinitely many genera $g\geq 9$. Next, we see an intriguing application of Bolza-like surfaces. In particular, we construct global maximal surfaces using these Bolza-like surfaces. Furthermore, we study a symmetric property satisfied by the systolic geodesics of our Bolza-like surfaces. We show that any simple closed geodesic intersects the systolic geodesics at an even number of points.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Handlebody-Links and Spatial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $G-$family of quandles is an algebraic construction which was proposed by A. Ishii, M. Iwakiri, Y. Jang, K. Oshiro in 2013. The axioms of these algebraic systems were motivated by handlebody-knot theory. In the present work we investigate possible constructions which generalise $G-$family of quandles and other similar constructions (for example, $Q-$ and $(G,*,f)-$families of quandles). We provide the necessary conditions under which the resulting object (called an $(X,G,{*_g},f,\otimes,\oplus)-$system) gives a colouring invariant of knotted handlebodies. We also discuss several other modifications of the proposed construction, providing invariants of spatial graphs with an arbitrary (finite) set of values of vertex valency. Besides, we consider several examples which in particular showcase the differences between spatial trivalent graph and handlebody-link theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally explore non-coherent band attachments between low crossing number knots, using grid diagrams. We significantly improve the current H(2)-distance table. In particular, we find two new distance one pairs with fewer than seven crossings: one between $3_1\#3_1$ and $7_4m$, and a chirally cosmetic one for $7_3$. We further determine a total of 33 previously unknown H(2)-distance one pairs for knots with up to $8$ crossings.</description>

      <title>On Geometric triangulations of double twist knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct two different explicit triangulations of the family of double twist knots $K(p,q)$ using methods of triangulating Dehn fillings, with layered solid tori and their double covers. One construction yields the canonical triangulation, and one yields a triangulation that we conjecture is minimal. We prove that both are geometric, meaning they are built of positively oriented convex hyperbolic tetrahedra. We use the conjecturally minimal triangulation to present eight equations cutting out the A-polynomial of these knots.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate connections between biquandle colorings, quiver enhancements, and several notions of the bridge numbers $b_i(K)$ for virtual links, where $i=1,2$. We show that for any positive integers $m \leq n$, there exists a virtual link $K$ with $b_1(K) = m$ and $b_2(K) = n$, thereby answering a question posed by Nakanishi and Satoh. In some sense, this gap between the two formulations measures how far the knot is from being classical. We also use these bridge number analyses to systematically construct families of links in which quiver invariants can distinguish between links that share the same biquandle counting invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the author's previous paper, the author constructed holomorphic quilts from the bigons of the Lagrangian Floer chain group after performing Lagrangian composition. This paper proves the uniqueness of such holomorphic quilts. As a consequence, it provides a combinatorial method for computing the boundary map of immersed Lagrangian Floer chain groups when the symplectic manifolds are closed surfaces. One outcome is the construction of many examples exhibiting figure eight bubbling, which also confirms a conjecture of Cazassus Herald Kirk Kotelskiy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Varying systems in a family leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossingn a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters.
  As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the ``topology breaks down''. We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka.\ winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These give a lower bond on the number of Dirac points in general that is sharp for 2-level systems. In the process, we treat several concrete models.
  In particular, we treat the lattices and tight--binding models, and show that effective winding maps can be achieved using $k$--th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. This includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilization of manifolds by a product of spheres or a projective space is important in geometry. There has been considerable recent work that studies the homotopy theory of stabilization for connected manifolds. This paper generalizes that work by developing new methods that allow for a generalization to stabilization of Poincar\'{e} Duality complexes. This includes the systematic study of a homotopy theoretic generalization of a gyration, obtained from a type of surgery in the manifold case. In particular, for a fixed Poincar\'{e} Duality complex, a criterion is given for the possible homotopy types of gyrations and shows there are only finitely many.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cocycles taking values in the mapping class group of closed surfaces and investigate their leading topological Lyapunov exponent. Under a natural closing property, we show that the top topological Lyapunov exponent can be approximated by periodic orbits. We also extend the notion of the joint spectral radius to this setting, interpreting it via the exponential growth of curves under iterated mapping classes. Our approach connects ideas from ergodic theory, Teichm\"uller geometry, and spectral theory, and suggests a broader framework for similar results.</description>

      <title>A discrete model for surface configuration spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary methods of studying the topology of configurations of points in a graph and configurations of disks in a planar region has been to examine discrete combinatorial models arising from the underlying spaces. Despite the success of these models in the graph and disk settings, they have not been constructed for the vast majority of surface configuration spaces. In this paper, we construct such a model for the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in an oriented surface $\Sigma$. More specifically, we prove that if we give $\Sigma$ a certain cube complex structure $K$, then the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in $\Sigma$ is homotopy equivalent to a subcomplex of $K^{m}$</description>

Abstract: We construct two-dimensional families of complex hyperbolic structures on disc orbibundles over the sphere with three cone points. This contrasts with the previously known examples of the same type, which are locally rigid. In particular, we obtain examples of complex hyperbolic structures on trivial and cotangent disc bundles over closed Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Morse-Smale property of the Thurston spine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thurston spine consists of the subset of Teichm\"uller space at which the set of shortest curves, the systoles, cuts the surface into polygons. The systole function is a topological Morse function on Teichm\"uller space. This paper shows that the Thurston spine satisfies a property defined in terms of the systole function analogous to that of Morse-Smale complexes of (smooth) Morse functions on compact manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Quasimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>

      <title>A rational cohomology which including that of a spin hyperelliptic mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{G}=\mathfrak{S}_{q} \overleftrightarrow{\times} \mathfrak{S}_q$ be the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-extension of the product of two symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_{q} \times \mathfrak{S}_q$. In this paper, we compute the $\mathfrak{G}$-invariant part of the rational cohomology of the pure braid group $P_{n}$, where $n=2q$, denoted by $H^{*}(P_n)^{\mathfrak{G}}$. As is known classically, $H^{*}(P_n)^{\mathfrak{G}}$ includes the rational cohomology of a spin hyperelliptic mapping class group, denoted by $H^*(\mathcal{S}(\Sigma_{g};c))$, where $2g+2=n=2q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1112.6107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let Q be a component of a stratum of abelian or quadratic differentials on an oriented surface of genus $g\geq 0$ with $m\geq 0$ punctures and $3g-3+m\geq 2$. We construct a subshift of finite type $(\Omega,\sigma)$ and a Borel suspension of $(\Omega,\sigma)$ which admits a finite-to-one semi-conjugacy into the Teichmueller flow $\Phi^t$ on Q. This is used to show that the $\Phi^t$-invariant Lebesgue measure on Q is the unique measure of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>On the Smith-Thom deficiency of Hilbert squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19120v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an expression for the Smith-Thom deficiency of the Hilbert square $X^{[2]}$ of a smooth real algebraic variety $X$ in terms of the rank of a suitable Mayer-Vietoris mapping in several situations. As a consequence, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximality of $X^{[2]}$ in the case of projective complete intersections, and show that with a few exceptions no real nonsingular projective complete intersection of even dimension has maximal Hilbert square. We also provide new examples of smooth real algebraic varieties with maximal Hilbert square.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>
