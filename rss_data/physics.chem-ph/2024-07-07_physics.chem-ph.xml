      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies for neutral molecules in any solvent with openCOSMO-RS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of solvation free energies is critical for understanding various phenomena in the liquid phase, including reaction rates, equilibrium constants, activity coefficients, and partition coefficients. Despite extensive research, precise prediction of solvation free energies remains challenging. In this study, we introduce openCOSMO-RS 24a, an improved version of the open-source COSMO-RS model, capable of predicting solvation free energies alongside other liquid-phase properties. We parameterize openCOSMO-RS 24a using quantum chemical calculations from ORCA 6.0, leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes solvation free energies, partition coefficients, and infinite dilution activity coefficients for various solutes and solvents at 25 {\deg}C. Additionally, we develop a Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships model to predict molar volumes of the solvents, an essential requirement for predicting solvation free energies from structure alone. Our results show that openCOSMO-RS 24a achieves an average absolute deviation of 0.45 kcal/mol for solvation free energies, 0.76 for partition coefficients, and 0.51 for infinite dilution activity coefficients, demonstrating improvements over the previous openCOSMO-RS 22 parameterization and comparable results to COSMOtherm 24 TZVP. A new command line interface for openCOSMO-RS 24a was developed which allows easy acces to the solvation energy model directly from within ORCA 6.0. This represents a significant advancement in the predictive modeling of solvation free energies and other solution-phase properties, providing researchers with a robust tool for applications in chemical and materials science.</description>

      <title>Accurate nuclear quantum statistics on machine-learned classical effective potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) to the properties of various hydrogen-bound systems, including biomolecules, is increasingly recognized. Despite the development of many acceleration techniques, the computational overhead of incorporating NQEs in complex systems is sizable, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we leverage deep learning and multiscale coarse-graining techniques to mitigate the computational burden of path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Specifically, we employ a machine-learned potential to accurately represent corrections to classical potentials, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost of simulating NQEs. We validate our approach using four distinct systems: Morse potential, Zundel cation, single water molecule, and bulk water. Our framework allows us to accurately compute position-dependent static properties, as demonstrated by the excellent agreement obtained between the machine-learned potential and computationally intensive PIMD calculations, even in the presence of strong NQEs. This approach opens the way to the development of transferable machine-learned potentials capable of accurately reproducing NQEs in a wide range of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Factorized Quadruples and a Predictor of Higher-Level Correlation in Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory has had a momentous impact on the ab initio prediction of molecular properties, and remains a staple ingratiate in high-accuracy thermochemical model chemistries. However, these methods require inclusion of at least some connected quadruple excitations, which generally scale at best as $\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ with the number of basis functions. It very difficult to predict, a priori, the effect correlation past CCSD(T) has on a give reaction energies. The purpose of this work is to examine cost-effective quadruple corrections based on the factorization theorem of many-body perturbation theory that may address these challenges. We show that the $\mathcal{O}(N^7)$, factorized CCSD(TQ${}_\text{f}$) method introduces minimal error to predicted correlation and reaction energies as compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ CCSD(TQ). Further, we examine the performance of Goodson's continued fraction method in the estimation of CCSDT(Q)${}_\Lambda$ contributions to reaction energies, as well as a "new" method related to %TAE[(T)] that we refer to as a scaled perturbation estimator. We find that the scaled perturbation estimator based upon CCSD(TQ${}_\text{f}$)/cc-pVDZ is capable of predicting CCSDT(Q)${}_\Lambda$/cc-pVDZ contributions to reaction energies with an average error of 0.07 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ and a RMST of 0.52 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ when applied to a test-suite of nearly 3000 reactions. This offers a means by which to reliably ballpark how important post-CCSD(T) contributions are to reaction energies while incurring no more than CCSD(T) formal cost and a little mental math.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent orbital-optimized coupled-cluster methods families for fermion-mixtures dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five time-dependent orbital optimized coupled-cluster (TD-ooCC) methods, of which four can converge to the complete active space self-consistent-field method, are presented for fermion-mixtures with arbitrary fermion kinds and numbers. Truncation schemes maintaining the intragroup orbital rotation invariance, as well as equations of motion of CC amplitudes and orbitals, are derived. Present methods are compact CC-parameterization alternatives to the time-dependent multiconfiguration self-consistent-field method for systems consisting of arbitrarily different kinds and numbers of interacting fermions. Theoretical analysis of applications of present methods to various chemical systems are reported.</description>

      <title>DeepLNE++ leveraging knowledge distillation for accelerated multi-state path-like collective variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-like collective variables can be very effective for accurately modeling complex biomolecular processes in molecular dynamics simulations. Recently, we introduced DeepLNE, a machine learning-based path-like CV that provides a progression variable s along the path as a non-linear combination of several descriptors, effectively approximating the reaction coordinate. However, DeepLNE is computationally expensive for realistic systems needing many descriptors and limited in its ability to handle multi-state reactions. Here we present DeepLNE++, which uses a knowledge distillation approach to significantly accelerate the evaluation of DeepLNE, making it feasible to compute free energy landscapes for large and complex biomolecular systems. In addition, DeepLNE++ encodes system-specific knowledge within a supervised multitasking framework, enhancing its versatility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pseudo-Jahn-Teller Activity on the Singlet-Triplet Gap of Azaphenalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the sensitivity of the singlet-triplet energy gap of selected azaphenalenes to symmetry lowering induced by Jahn-Teller interactions. While cyclazine in its characteristic $D_{\rm 3h}$ structure defies Hund's rule, CCSD(T)-level modeling suggests its structure corresponds to two equivalent minima of $C_{\rm 3h}$ symmetry undergoing rapid automerization. The combined effect of symmetry reduction and high-level corrections indicates a negligible singlet-triplet gap in cyclazine. Notably, pentazine and heptazine prefer symmetric structures exhibiting negative gaps in accord with experiments. Azaphenalenes containing nitrogen atoms at electron-deficient sites exhibit stronger in-plane structural distortion; in their low-symmetry energy minima, they adhere to Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>The Radical Pair Mechanism Cannot Explain Telecommunication Frequency Effects on Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate whether the radical pair mechanism (RPM) can explain the effects of telecommunication frequency radiation on reactive oxygen species production, we modelled the effects of oscillating magnetic fields on radical pair systems. Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the biological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due to negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental setups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require hyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that far exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude that some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of telecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Application of Magnus expansion for the quantum dynamics of $\Lambda$-systems under periodic driving and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a sixth order expression for the differential time evolution operator based on the Magnus expansion (ME), we conducted quantum dynamics calculations of a $\Lambda$-system driven by two sinusoidal time dependent fields. For a closed system dynamics, we confirmed the equivalence of the dynamics in the Hilbert space and the Liouville space numerically. We also conducted open system quantum dynamics calculation by generalizing the ME to the non-Hermitian dynamics in the Liouville space for the case where the effects of photonic bath are represented by Lindblad operators. In both cases, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was assessed. We found significant errors of RWA during initial stages of the dynamics for representative cases where electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population trapping can be observed. The presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics reduces the errors of RWA, but significant errors for off-diagonal elements of the density operator can still be seen. We also found that approaches to steady state limits of exact dynamics are slower than those for RWA. These results demonstrate the utility of the ME as a general and reliable tool for closed and open system quantum dynamics for time dependent Hamiltonians, and expose potential issues of drawing conclusions based solely on RWA.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Transmission spectroscopy of CF$_4$ molecules in intense x-ray fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear interaction of x-rays with matter is at the heart of understanding and controlling ultrafast molecular dynamics from an atom-specific viewpoint, providing new scientific and analytical opportunities to explore the structure and dynamics of small quantum systems. At increasingly high x-ray intensity, the sensitivity of ultrashort x-ray pulses to specific electronic states and emerging short-lived transient intermediates is of particular relevance for our understanding of fundamental multi-photon absorption processes. In this work, intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses at the European XFEL (EuXFEL) are combined with a gas cell and grating spectrometer for a high-intensity transmission spectroscopy study of multiphoton-induced ultrafast molecular fragmentation dynamics in CF$_4$. This approach unlocks the direct intra-pulse observation of transient fragments, including neutral atoms, by their characteristic absorption lines in the transmitted broad-band x-ray spectrum. The dynamics with and without initially producing fluorine K-shell holes are studied by tuning the central photon energy. The absorption spectra are measured at different FEL intensities to observe nonlinear effects. Transient isolated fluorine atoms and ions are spectroscopically recorded within the ultrashort pulse duration of few tens of femtoseconds. An isosbestic point that signifies the correlated transition between intact neutral CF$_4$ molecules and charged atomic fragments is observed near the fluorine K-edge. The dissociation dynamics and the multiphoton absorption-induced dynamics encoded in the spectra are theoretically interpreted. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-intensity x-ray transmission spectroscopy to study ultrafast molecular dynamics with sensitivity to specific intermediate species and their electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft lubrication has been shown to drastically affect the mobility of an object immersed in a viscous fluid in the vicinity of a purely elastic wall. In this theoretical study, we develop a minimal model incorporating  viscoelasticity, carrying out a  perturbation analysis in both the elastic deformation of the wall and its viscous damping. Our approach reveals the singular-perturbation nature of viscoelasticity to soft lubrication. Numerical resolution of the resulting non-linear, singular and coupled equations of motion reveals  peculiar effects of viscoelasticity on confined colloidal mobility, opening the way towards the description of complex migration scenarios near realistic polymeric substrates and biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Experiment on intrinsically nonequilibrium distribution of large ions in charged small nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical research on locally nonchaotic gravitational energy barrier led to an interesting finding: beyond the boundaries of Boltzmann's H-theorem, there may be macroscopic systems with nontrivial energy properties. The fundamental mechanism is rooted in the intrinsically nonequilibrium steady state. In the current investigation, we experimentally verify this concept, with the weak gravitational force being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on capacitive cells with the same nanoporous electrodes and various electrolyte concentrations. The key characteristic is that the nanopore size is only slightly larger than the ion size, less than twice the ion size. The confinement effect of the nanopore walls plays the role of the spontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND). At first glance, the capacitive cells exhibit "normal" charge curves. However, their steady-state ion distribution significantly differs from thermodynamic equilibrium. The measured potential difference is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamics. Such phenomena are in line with the molecular dynamics simulations reported in the open literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical many-electron calculations can predict properties of atoms, molecules and even complex materials. The employed computational methods play a quintessential role in many scientifically and technologically relevant research fields. However, a question of paramount importance is whether approximations aimed at reducing the computational complexity for solving the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation, are accurate enough. Here, we investigate recently reported discrepancies of noncovalent interaction energies for large molecules predicted by two of the most widely-trusted many-electron theories: diffusion quantum Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster theory. We are able to unequivocally pin down the source of the puzzling discrepancies and present modifications to widely-used coupled-cluster methods needed for more accurate noncovalent interaction energies of large molecules on the hundred-atom scale. This enhances the reliability of predictions from quantum mechanical many-electron theories across a wide range of critical applications, including drug design, catalysis, and the innovation of new functional materials, such as those for renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Splitting probabilities as optimal controllers of rare reactive events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The committor constitutes the primary quantity of interest within chemical kinetics as it is understood to encode the ideal reaction coordinate for a rare reactive event. We show the generative utility of the committor, in that it can be used explicitly to produce a reactive trajectory ensemble that exhibits numerically exact statistics as that of the original transition path ensemble. This is done by relating a time-dependent analogue of the committor that solves a generalized bridge problem, to the splitting probability that solves a boundary value problem under a bistable assumption. By invoking stochastic optimal control and spectral theory, we derive a general form for the optimal controller of a bridge process that connects two metastable states expressed in terms of the splitting probability. This formalism offers an alternative perspective into the role of the committor and its gradients, in that they encode forcefields that guarantee reactivity, generating trajectories that are statistically identical to the way that a system would react autonomously.</description>

Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>
