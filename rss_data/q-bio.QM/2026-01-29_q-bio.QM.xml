      <title>CEI: A Clonal Expansion Identifier for T-cell receptor clones following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each T cell typically carries a specific T-cell receptor (TCR) that determines its specificity against an epitope presented by the HLA complex on a target cell. Antigenic challenge triggers the expansion of reactive cells within a diverse pool of T cells with randomly generated receptors, a process that results in epitope-driven shifts of TCR frequencies over time. Here, we analyze the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the TCR populations in peripheral blood drawn from seven COVID-naive individuals, before vaccines were widely available. To identify SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TCR sequences among the $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ TCR sequences sampled before and after vaccination, we develop statistical criteria to detect significant increases in abundance of positive TCR clones. Application of our statistical methods shows a robust identification of TCR sequences that respond to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in vivo, illustrating the feasibility of quantifying the clone-specific dynamics of T-cell abundance changes following immunological perturbations.</description>

      <title>Implications of temporal sampling in voltage imaging microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.</description>

      <title>AGFS-Tractometry: A Novel Atlas-Guided Fine-Scale Tractometry Approach for Enhanced Along-Tract Group Statistical Comparison Using Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10601</link>

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and related code are available at: https://github.com/ZhengRuixi/AGFS-Tractometry.git.</description>

      <title>Bayesian dictionary learning estimation of cell membrane permeability from surface pH data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas transport across cell membrane is a very important process in biochemistry which is essential for many crucial tasks, including cell respiration pH regulation in the cell. In the late 1990's, the suggestion that gasses are transported via preferred gas channels embedded into the cell membrane challenged the century old Overton's theory that gases pass through the lipid cell membrane by diffusing across the concentration gradient. Since experimental evidence alone does not provide enough evidence to favor one of the proposed mechanisms, mathematical models have been introduced to provide a context for the interpretation of laboratory measurement. Following up on previous work where the membrane permeability was estimated using particle filter, in this article we propose an algorithm based on dictionary learning for estimating cell membrane permeability. Computed examples illustrate that the novel approach, which can be applied when the properties of the membrane do not change in the course of the data collection process, is computationally much more efficient than particle filter.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>
