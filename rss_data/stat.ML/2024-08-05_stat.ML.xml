      <title>Deep Learning Approach for Changepoint Detection: Penalty Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changepoint detection, a technique for identifying significant shifts within data sequences, is crucial in various fields such as finance, genomics, medicine, etc. Dynamic programming changepoint detection algorithms are employed to identify the locations of changepoints within a sequence, which rely on a penalty parameter to regulate the number of changepoints. To estimate this penalty parameter, previous work uses simple models such as linear models or decision trees. This study introduces a novel deep learning method for predicting penalty parameters, leading to demonstrably improved changepoint detection accuracy on large benchmark supervised labeled datasets compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Models with Optimal Weights for Distributed Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models have received increasingly attentions in recent years due to their superb prediction accuracy and modeling flexibility. To address the computational burdens of GP models for large-scale datasets, distributed learning for GPs are often adopted. Current aggregation models for distributed GPs are not time-efficient when incorporating correlations between GP experts. In this work, we propose a novel approach for aggregated prediction in distributed GPs. The technique is suitable for both the exact and sparse variational GPs. The proposed method incorporates correlations among experts, leading to better prediction accuracy with manageable computational requirements. As demonstrated by empirical studies, the proposed approach results in more stable predictions in less time than state-of-the-art consistent aggregation models.</description>

      <title>META-ANOVA: Screening interactions for interpretable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two things to be considered when we evaluate predictive models. One is prediction accuracy,and the other is interpretability. Over the recent decades, many prediction models of high performance, such as ensemble-based models and deep neural networks, have been developed. However, these models are often too complex, making it difficult to intuitively interpret their predictions. This complexity in interpretation limits their use in many real-world fields that require accountability, such as medicine, finance, and college admissions. In this study, we develop a novel method called Meta-ANOVA to provide an interpretable model for any given prediction model. The basic idea of Meta-ANOVA is to transform a given black-box prediction model to the functional ANOVA model. A novel technical contribution of Meta-ANOVA is a procedure of screening out unnecessary interaction before transforming a given black-box model to the functional ANOVA model. This screening procedure allows the inclusion of higher order interactions in the transformed functional ANOVA model without computational difficulties. We prove that the screening procedure is asymptotically consistent. Through various experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of Meta-ANOVA</description>

      <title>A Family of Distributions of Random Subsets for Controlling Positive and Negative Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive and negative dependence are fundamental concepts that characterize the attractive and repulsive behavior of random subsets. Although some probabilistic models are known to exhibit positive or negative dependence, it is challenging to seamlessly bridge them with a practicable probabilistic model. In this study, we introduce a new family of distributions, named the discrete kernel point process (DKPP), which includes determinantal point processes and parts of Boltzmann machines. We also develop some computational methods for probabilistic operations and inference with DKPPs, such as calculating marginal and conditional probabilities and learning the parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the controllability of positive and negative dependence and the effectiveness of the computational methods for DKPPs.</description>

      <title>Universality of kernel random matrices and kernel regression in the quadratic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In this regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibit behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and generalization errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for both deterministic and random teacher models. Our proof techniques combine moment methods, Wick's formula, orthogonal polynomials, and resolvent analysis of random matrices with correlated entries.</description>

      <title>Assessing Robustness of Machine Learning Models using Covariate Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in critical decision-making models and systems in fields like finance, healthcare, etc., ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks and changes in the input data is paramount, especially in cases where models potentially overfit. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for assessing the robustness of machine learning models through covariate perturbation techniques. We explore various perturbation strategies to assess robustness and examine their impact on model predictions, including separate strategies for numeric and non-numeric variables, summaries of perturbations to assess and compare model robustness across different scenarios, and local robustness diagnosis to identify any regions in the data where a model is particularly unstable. Through empirical studies on real world dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparing robustness across models, identifying the instabilities in the model, and enhancing model robustness.</description>

      <title>A Decision-driven Methodology for Designing Uncertainty-aware AI Self-Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized decision-making processes and systems throughout society and, in particular, has emerged as a significant technology in high-impact scenarios of national interest. Yet, despite AI's impressive predictive capabilities in controlled settings, it still suffers from a range of practical setbacks preventing its widespread use in various critical scenarios. In particular, it is generally unclear if a given AI system's predictions can be trusted by decision-makers in downstream applications. To address the need for more transparent, robust, and trustworthy AI systems, a suite of tools has been developed to quantify the uncertainty of AI predictions and, more generally, enable AI to "self-assess" the reliability of its predictions. In this manuscript, we categorize methods for AI self-assessment along several key dimensions and provide guidelines for selecting and designing the appropriate method for a practitioner's needs. In particular, we focus on uncertainty estimation techniques that consider the impact of self-assessment on the choices made by downstream decision-makers and on the resulting costs and benefits of decision outcomes. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology for self-assessment design, we illustrate its use for two realistic national-interest scenarios. This manuscript is a practical guide for machine learning engineers and AI system users to select the ideal self-assessment techniques for each problem.</description>

      <title>Point Prediction for Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new approaches for point prediction with streaming data. One is based on the Count-Min sketch (CMS) and the other is based on Gaussian process priors with a random bias. These methods are intended for the most general predictive problems where no true model can be usefully formulated for the data stream. In statistical contexts, this is often called the $\mathcal{M}$-open problem class. Under the assumption that the data consists of i.i.d samples from a fixed distribution function $F$, we show that the CMS-based estimates of the distribution function are consistent.
  We compare our new methods with two established predictors in terms of cumulative $L^1$ error. One is based on the Shtarkov solution (often called the normalized maximum likelihood) in the normal experts setting and the other is based on Dirichlet process priors. These comparisons are for two cases. The first is one-pass meaning that the updating of the predictors is done using the fact that the CMS is a sketch. For predictors that are not one-pass, we use streaming $K$-means to give a representative subset of fixed size that can be updated as data accumulate.
  Preliminary computational work suggests that the one-pass median version of the CMS method is rarely outperformed by the other methods for sufficiently complex data. We also find that predictors based on Gaussian process priors with random biases perform well. The Shtarkov predictors we use here did not perform as well probably because we were only using the simplest example. The other predictors seemed to perform well mainly when the data did not look like they came from an M-open data generator.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a problem estimating coefficients of linear regression under sparsity assumption when covariates and noises are sampled from heavy tailed distributions. Additionally, we consider the situation where not only covariates and noises are sampled from heavy tailed distributions but also contaminated by outliers. Our estimators can be computed efficiently, and exhibit sharp error bounds.</description>

      <title>Autoencoders in Function Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoencoders have found widespread application, in both their original deterministic form and in their variational formulation (VAEs). In scientific applications it is often of interest to consider data that are comprised of functions; the same perspective is useful in image processing. In practice, discretisation (of differential equations arising in the sciences) or pixellation (of images) renders problems finite dimensional, but conceiving first of algorithms that operate on functions, and only then discretising or pixellating, leads to better algorithms that smoothly operate between different levels of discretisation or pixellation. In this paper function-space versions of the autoencoder (FAE) and variational autoencoder (FVAE) are introduced, analysed, and deployed. Well-definedness of the objective function governing VAEs is a subtle issue, even in finite dimension, and more so on function space. The FVAE objective is well defined whenever the data distribution is compatible with the chosen generative model; this happens, for example, when the data arise from a stochastic differential equation. The FAE objective is valid much more broadly, and can be straightforwardly applied to data governed by differential equations. Pairing these objectives with neural operator architectures, which can thus be evaluated on any mesh, enables new applications of autoencoders to inpainting, superresolution, and generative modelling of scientific data.</description>

      <title>Resampling and averaging coordinates on data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce algorithms for robustly computing intrinsic coordinates on point clouds. Our approach relies on generating many candidate coordinates by subsampling the data and varying hyperparameters of the embedding algorithm (e.g., manifold learning). We then identify a subset of representative embeddings by clustering the collection of candidate coordinates and using shape descriptors from topological data analysis. The final output is the embedding obtained as an average of the representative embeddings using generalized Procrustes analysis. We validate our algorithm on both synthetic data and experimental measurements from genomics, demonstrating robustness to noise and outliers.</description>

      <title>Deep Uncertainty-based explore For Index Construction and Retrieval in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, the relevance and novelty of the final results are selected through a cascade system of Matching -&gt; Ranking -&gt; Strategy. The matching model serves as the starting point of the pipeline and determines the upper bound of the subsequent stages. Balancing the relevance and novelty of matching results is a crucial step in the design and optimization of recommendation systems, contributing significantly to improving recommendation quality. However, the typical matching algorithms have not simultaneously addressed the relevance and novelty perfectly. One main reason is that deep matching algorithms exhibit significant uncertainty when estimating items in the long tail (e.g., due to insufficient training samples) items.The uncertainty not only affects the training of the models but also influences the confidence in the index construction and beam search retrieval process of these models. This paper proposes the UICR (Uncertainty-based explore for Index Construction and Retrieval) algorithm, which introduces the concept of uncertainty modeling in the matching stage and achieves multi-task modeling of model uncertainty and index uncertainty. The final matching results are obtained by combining the relevance score and uncertainty score infered by the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the UICR improves novelty without sacrificing relevance on realworld industrial productive environments and multiple open-source datasets. Remarkably, online A/B test results of display advertising in Shopee demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Field-Weighted Factorization Machines for Low Latency Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factorization machine (FM) variants are widely used in recommendation systems that operate under strict throughput and latency requirements, such as online advertising systems. FMs are known both due to their ability to model pairwise feature interactions while being resilient to data sparsity, and their computational graphs that facilitate fast inference and training. Moreover, when items are ranked as a part of a query for each incoming user, these graphs facilitate computing the portion stemming from the user and context fields only once per query. Consequently, in terms of inference cost, the number of user or context fields is practically unlimited. More advanced FM variants, such as FwFM, provide better accuracy by learning a representation of field-wise interactions, but require computing all pairwise interaction terms explicitly. The computational cost during inference is proportional to the square of the number of fields, including user, context, and item. When the number of fields is large, this is prohibitive in systems with strict latency constraints. To mitigate this caveat, heuristic pruning of low intensity field interactions is commonly used to accelerate inference. In this work we propose an alternative to the pruning heuristic in FwFMs using a diagonal plus symmetric low-rank decomposition. Our technique reduces the computational cost of inference, by allowing it to be proportional to the number of item fields only. Using a set of experiments on real-world datasets, we show that aggressive rank reduction outperforms similarly aggressive pruning, both in terms of accuracy and item recommendation speed. We corroborate our claim of faster inference experimentally, both via a synthetic test, and by having deployed our solution to a major online advertising system. The code to reproduce our experimental results is at https://github.com/michaelviderman/pytorch-fm/tree/dev.</description>

      <title>Distance-Preserving Generative Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics data is invaluable for understanding the spatial organization of gene expression in tissues. There have been consistent efforts in studying how to effectively utilize the associated spatial information for refining gene expression modeling. We introduce a class of distance-preserving generative models for spatial transcriptomics, which utilizes the provided spatial information to regularize the learned representation space of gene expressions to have a similar pair-wise distance structure. This helps the latent space to capture meaningful encodings of genes in spatial proximity. We carry out theoretical analysis over a tractable loss function for this purpose and formalize the overall learning objective as a regularized evidence lower bound. Our framework grants compatibility with any variational-inference-based generative models for gene expression modeling. Empirically, we validate our proposed method on the mouse brain tissues Visium dataset and observe improved performance with variational autoencoders and scVI used as backbone models.</description>

      <title>Towards Certified Unlearning for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine unlearning, certified unlearning has been extensively studied in convex machine learning models due to its high efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees. However, its application to deep neural networks (DNNs), known for their highly nonconvex nature, still poses challenges. To bridge the gap between certified unlearning and DNNs, we propose several simple techniques to extend certified unlearning methods to nonconvex objectives. To reduce the time complexity, we develop an efficient computation method by inverse Hessian approximation without compromising certification guarantees. In addition, we extend our discussion of certification to nonconvergence training and sequential unlearning, considering that real-world users can send unlearning requests at different time points. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and the advantages of certified unlearning in DNNs.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of Total Uncertainty in AI: A Theoretical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI has been dealing with uncertainty to have highly accurate results. This becomes even worse with reasonably small data sets or a variation in the data sets. This has far-reaching effects on decision-making, forecasting and learning mechanisms. This study seeks to unpack the nature of uncertainty that exists within AI by drawing ideas from established works, the latest developments and practical applications and provide a novel total uncertainty definition in AI.
  From inception theories up to current methodologies, this paper provides an integrated view of dealing with better total uncertainty as well as complexities of uncertainty in AI that help us understand its meaning and value across different domains.</description>

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are neural networks with symmetry. Motivated by the theory of group representations, we decompose the layers of an equivariant neural network into simple representations. The nonlinear activation functions lead to interesting nonlinear equivariant maps between simple representations. For example, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) gives rise to piecewise linear maps. We show that these considerations lead to a filtration of equivariant neural networks, generalizing Fourier series. This observation might provide a useful tool for interpreting equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Universal In-context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define "in-context mappings" which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for vision transformers). This work studies in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically and uniformly address the expressivity of these architectures, we consider the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens (discrete for a finite number of tokens). The related notion of smoothness corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLP layers between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled.</description>

      <title>Amortized Probabilistic Detection of Communities in Graphs</title>

Abstract: Learning community structures in graphs has broad applications across scientific domains. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in encoding graph structures, existing GNN-based methods for community detection are limited by requiring knowledge of the number of communities in advance, in addition to lacking a proper probabilistic formulation to handle uncertainty. We propose a simple framework for amortized community detection, which addresses both of these issues by combining the expressive power of GNNs with recent methods for amortized clustering. Our models consist of a graph representation backbone that extracts structural information and an amortized clustering network that naturally handles variable numbers of clusters. Both components combine into well-defined models of the posterior distribution of graph communities and are jointly optimized given labeled graphs. At inference time, the models yield parallel samples from the posterior of community labels, quantifying uncertainty in a principled way. We evaluate several models from our framework on synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate improved performance compared to previous methods. As a separate contribution, we extend recent amortized probabilistic clustering architectures by adding attention modules, which yield further improvements on community detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Interval Estimation for Optimal Policy Evaluation in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15501v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of an ongoing policy plays a vital role in many areas such as medicine and economics, to provide crucial instructions on the early-stop of the online experiment and timely feedback from the environment. Policy evaluation in online learning thus attracts increasing attention by inferring the mean outcome of the optimal policy (i.e., the value) in real-time. Yet, such a problem is particularly challenging due to the dependent data generated in the online environment, the unknown optimal policy, and the complex exploration and exploitation trade-off in the adaptive experiment. In this paper, we aim to overcome these difficulties in policy evaluation for online learning. We explicitly derive the probability of exploration that quantifies the probability of exploring non-optimal actions under commonly used bandit algorithms. We use this probability to conduct valid inference on the online conditional mean estimator under each action and develop the doubly robust interval estimation (DREAM) method to infer the value under the estimated optimal policy in online learning. The proposed value estimator provides double protection for consistency and is asymptotically normal with a Wald-type confidence interval provided. Extensive simulation studies and real data applications are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed DREAM method.</description>

      <title>Mixed moving average field guided learning for spatio-temporal data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influenced mixed moving average fields are a versatile modeling class for spatio-temporal data. However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>D-CDLF: Decomposition of Common and Distinctive Latent Factors for Multi-view High-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical approach to the joint analysis of multiple high-dimensional data views is to decompose each view's data matrix into three parts: a low-rank common-source matrix generated by common latent factors of all data views, a low-rank distinctive-source matrix generated by distinctive latent factors of the corresponding data view, and an additive noise matrix. Existing decomposition methods often focus on the uncorrelatedness between the common latent factors and distinctive latent factors, but inadequately address the equally necessary uncorrelatedness between distinctive latent factors from different data views. We propose a novel decomposition method, called Decomposition of Common and Distinctive Latent Factors (D-CDLF), to effectively achieve both types of uncorrelatedness for two-view data. We also discuss the estimation of the D-CDLF under high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>DASA: Delay-Adaptive Multi-Agent Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>

      <title>SLIP: Securing LLMs IP Using Weights Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption, in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting enormous investments by their owners. Moreover, the high cost of cloud-based deployment has driven interest towards deployment to edge devices, yet this risks exposing valuable parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Current methods to protect models' IP on the edge have limitations in terms of practicality, loss in accuracy, or suitability to requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid inference algorithm, named SLIP, designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while having zero accuracy degradation and minimal impact on latency. It involves partitioning the model between two computing resources, one secure but expensive, and another cost-effective but vulnerable. This is achieved through matrix decomposition, ensuring that the secure resource retains a maximally sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing a minimal amount of computations, and vice versa for the vulnerable resource. Importantly, the protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from exploiting the partition to infer the secured information. Finally, we present experimental results that show the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.</description>

      <title>Boosted generalized normal distributions: Integrating machine learning with operations knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of machine learning (ML) techniques to operational settings often face two challenges: i) ML methods mostly provide point predictions whereas many operational problems require distributional information; and ii) They typically do not incorporate the extensive body of knowledge in the operations literature, particularly the theoretical and empirical findings that characterize specific distributions. We introduce a novel and rigorous methodology, the Boosted Generalized Normal Distribution ($b$GND), to address these challenges. The Generalized Normal Distribution (GND) encompasses a wide range of parametric distributions commonly encountered in operations, and $b$GND leverages gradient boosting with tree learners to flexibly estimate the parameters of the GND as functions of covariates. We establish $b$GND's statistical consistency, thereby extending this key property to special cases studied in the ML literature that lacked such guarantees. Using data from a large academic emergency department in the United States, we show that the distributional forecasting of patient wait and service times can be meaningfully improved by leveraging findings from the healthcare operations literature. Specifically, $b$GND performs 6% and 9% better than the distribution-agnostic ML benchmark used to forecast wait and service times respectively. Further analysis suggests that these improvements translate into a 9% increase in patient satisfaction and a 4% reduction in mortality for myocardial infarction patients. Our work underscores the importance of integrating ML with operations knowledge to enhance distributional forecasts.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning applied to Insurance Portfolio Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When faced with a new customer, many factors contribute to an insurance firm's decision of what offer to make to that customer. In addition to the expected cost of providing the insurance, the firm must consider the other offers likely to be made to the customer, and how sensitive the customer is to differences in price. Moreover, firms often target a specific portfolio of customers that could depend on, e.g., age, location, and occupation. Given such a target portfolio, firms may choose to modulate an individual customer's offer based on whether the firm desires the customer within their portfolio. We term the problem of modulating offers to achieve a desired target portfolio the portfolio pursuit problem. Having formulated the portfolio pursuit problem as a sequential decision making problem, we devise a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for its solution. We test our method on a complex synthetic market environment, and demonstrate that it outperforms a baseline method which mimics current industry approaches to portfolio pursuit.</description>
