      <title>A consequence of failed sequential learning: A computational account of developmental amnesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developmental amnesia, featured with severely impaired episodic memory and almost normal semantic memory, has been discovered to occur in children with hippocampal atrophy. This unique combination of characteristics seems to challenge the understanding that early loss of episodic memory may impede cognitive development and result in severe mental retardation. Although a few underlying mechanisms have been suggested, no computational model has been reported that is able to mimic the unique combination of characteristics. In this study, a cognitive system is presented, and developmental amnesia is demonstrated computationally in terms of impaired episodic recall, spared recognition and spared semantic learning. Impaired sequential/spatial learning ability of the hippocampus is suggested to be the cause of such amnesia. Simulation shows that impaired sequential leaning may only result in severe impairment of episodic recall, but affect neither recognition ability nor semantic learning. The spared semantic learning is inline with the view that semantic learning is largely associated with the consolidation of episodic memory, a process in which episodic memory may be mostly activated randomly, instead of sequentially. Furthermore, retrograded amnesia is also simulated, and the result and its mechanism are in agreement with most computational models of amnesia reported previously.</description>

      <title>Left-right asymmetry in predicting brain activity from LLMs' representations emerges with their formal linguistic competence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).</description>

      <title>Algebraic Connectivity Reveals Modulated High-Order Functional Networks in Alzheimer's Disease</title>

Abstract: Functional MRI is a neuroimaging technique that analyzes the functional activity of the brain by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals throughout the brain. The derived functional features can be used for investigating brain alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this work, we employed a hypergraph to model high-order functional relations across brain regions, introducing algebraic connectivity (a(G)) for estimating the hyperedge weights. The hypergraph structure was derived from healthy controls to build a common topology across individuals. The considered cohort for subsequent analyses included subjects covering the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, encompassing both mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. Statistical analysis and three classification tasks: HC vs AD, MCI vs AD, and HC vs MCI, were performed to assess differences across the three groups and the potential of the hyperedge weights as functional features. Furthermore, a mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the reliability of the a(G) values, representing functional information as the mediator between tau-PET levels, a key biomarker of AD, and cognitive scores. The proposed approach identified a larger number of hyperedges statistically different across groups compared to state-of-the-art methods. The a(G) hyperedge weights also demonstrated a higher discriminative power in all three binary classifications. Finally, two hyperedges belonging to salience/ventral attention and somatomotor networks showed a partial mediation effect between the tau biomarker and cognitive decline. These results suggested that a(G) can be an effective approach for extracting the hyperedge weights, including important functional information that resides in the brain areas forming the hyperedges.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about the neural mechanisms underlying long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). Cognitive states may not have sensory or motor correlates. For example, you can sit in a quiet room making plans without moving or sensory processing. You can also make plans while out walking. This suggests that the neural substrate for cognitive states neither depends on nor interferes with ongoing sensorimotor brain activity. In this perspective, I make the case for a possible second tier of neural activity that coexists with the well-established sensorimotor tier, based on coordinated spike-timing activity. The discovery of millisecond-precision spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. High temporal resolution enables a broader range of neural codes. The relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range triggers spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). What spike-timing mechanisms could engage STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision, and neural mechanisms can plausibly enable traveling waves to trigger STDP lasting for hours in cortical neurons. This temporary cortical network, riding astride the long-term sensorimotor network, could support cognitive processing and long-term working memory.</description>

      <title>Linguistics and Human Brain: A Perspective of Computational Neuroscience</title>

Abstract: Elucidating the language-brain relationship requires bridging the methodological gap between the abstract theoretical frameworks of linguistics and the empirical neural data of neuroscience. Serving as an interdisciplinary cornerstone, computational neuroscience formalizes the hierarchical and dynamic structures of language into testable neural models through modeling, simulation, and data analysis. This enables a computational dialogue between linguistic hypotheses and neural mechanisms. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), have powerfully advanced this pursuit. Their high-dimensional representational spaces provide a novel scale for exploring the neural basis of linguistic processing, while the "model-brain alignment" framework offers a methodology to evaluate the biological plausibility of language-related theories.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Based Similarities as an Alternative to Neural Data for Improving Convolutional Neural Network Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in many visual tasks but remain susceptible to adversarial attacks-imperceptible perturbations that degrade performance. Prior research reveals that brain-inspired regularizers, derived from neural recordings, can bolster CNN robustness; however, reliance on specialized data limits practical adoption. We revisit a regularizer proposed by Li et al. (2019) that aligns CNN representations with neural representational similarity structures and introduce a data-driven variant. Instead of a neural recording-based similarity, our method computes a pixel-based similarity directly from images. This substitution retains the original biologically motivated loss formulation, preserving its robustness benefits while removing the need for neural measurements or task-specific augmentations. Notably, this data-driven variant provides the same robustness improvements observed with neural data. Our approach is lightweight and integrates easily into standard pipelines. Although we do not surpass cutting-edge specialized defenses, we show that neural representational insights can be leveraged without direct recordings. This underscores the promise of robust yet simple methods rooted in brain-inspired principles, even without specialized data, and raises the possibility that further integrating these insights could push performance closer to human levels without resorting to complex, specialized pipelines.</description>
