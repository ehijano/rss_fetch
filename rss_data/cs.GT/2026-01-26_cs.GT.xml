      <title>Game-to-Real Gap: Quantifying the Effect of Model Misspecification in Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic models and solution concepts provide rigorous tools for predicting collective behavior in multi-agent systems. In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation. Finally, through illustrative numerical experiments, we show that existing centrality measures in network games may provide a counterintuitive understanding of the impact of model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Bilateral Trade under Semi Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of \textit{regret minimization in fixed-price bilateral trade} has received considerable attention in recent research. Previous works [CCC+24a, CCC+24b, AFF24, BCCF24, CJLZ25, LCM25a, GDFS25] have acquired a thorough understanding of the problem, except for determining the tight regret bound for GBB semi-feedback fixed-price mechanisms under adversarial values.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question by devising an $\widetilde{O}(T^{2 / 3})$-regret mechanism, matching the $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ lower bound from [CJLZ25] up to polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Anonymous Pricing in Large Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study revenue maximization when a seller offers $k$ identical units to ex ante heterogeneous, unit-demand buyers. While anonymous pricing can be $\Theta(\log k)$ worse than optimal in general multi-unit environments, we show that this pessimism disappears in large markets, where no single buyer accounts for a non-negligible share of optimal revenue. Under (quasi-)regularity, anonymous pricing achieves a $2+O(1/\sqrt{k})$ approximation to the optimal mechanism; the worst-case ratio is maximized at about $2.47$ when $k=1$ and converges to $2$ as $k$ grows. This indicates that the gains from third-degree price discrimination are mild in large markets.</description>

      <title>Participatory Budgeting Project Strength via Candidate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of candidate control in participatory budgeting elections. The goal of constructive candidate control is to ensure that a given candidate wins by either adding or deleting candidates from the election (in the destructive setting, the goal is to prevent a given candidate from winning). We show that such control problems are NP-hard to solve for many participatory budgeting voting rules, including Phragm\'en and Method of Equal Shares, but there are natural cases with polynomial-time algorithms (e.g., for the GreedyAV rule and projects with costs encoded in unary). We also argue that control by deleting candidates is a useful tool for assessing the performance (or, strength) of initially losing projects, and we support this view with experiments.</description>

      <title>On Best-of-Both-Worlds Fairness via Sum-of-Variances Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations. Ex-ante fairness (proportionality) can trivially be obtained by giving all goods to a random agent. Yet, such an allocation is very unfair ex-post. This has motivated the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) approach, seeking a randomized allocation that is ex-ante proportional and is supported only on ex-post fair allocations (e.g., on allocations that are envy-free-up-to-one-good (EF1), or give some constant fraction of the maximin share (MMS)). It is commonly pointed out that the distribution that allocates all goods to one agent at random fails to be ex-post fair as it ignores the variances of the values of the agents. We examine the approach of trying to mitigate this problem by minimizing the sum-of-variances of the values of the agents, subject to ex-ante proportionality. We study the ex-post fairness properties of the resulting distributions. In support of this approach, observe that such an optimization will indeed deterministically output a proportional allocation if such exists. We show that when valuations are identical, this approach indeed guarantees fairness ex-post: all allocations in the support are envy-free-up-to-any-good (EFX), and thus guarantee every agent at least 4/7 of her maximin share (but not her full MMS). On the negative side, we show that this approach completely fails when valuations are not identical: even in the simplest setting of only two agents and two goods, when the additive valuations are not identical, there is positive probability of allocating both goods to the same agent. Thus, the supporting ex-post allocation might not even be EF1, and might not give an agent any constant fraction of her MMS. Finally, we present similar negative results for other natural minimization objectives that are based on variances.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Coalition Power: Majorization, Lattices, and Displacement in Multiwinner Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much influence can a coordinated coalition exert in a multiwinner Top-$k$ election under a positional scoring rule? We study the maximum displacement problem: with coalition size $m$, how many of the current top-$k$ winners can be forced out? We show coalition power decomposes into two independent prefix-majorization constraints, capturing how much the coalition can (i) boost outsiders and (ii) suppress weak winners. For arbitrary scoring rules these prefix inequalities are tight, efficiently checkable necessary conditions (exact in the continuous relaxation).
  For common-step arithmetic-progression (AP) score ladders, including Borda, truncated Borda, $k$-approval/$k$-veto, plurality, and multi-level rules such as $3$--$2$--$1$, we prove a Majorization--Lattice Theorem: feasible aggregate score vectors are exactly the integer points satisfying the Block--HLP prefix-sum capacity constraints plus a single global congruence condition modulo the step size $g$. For Borda ($g=1$) the congruence vanishes, yielding a pure prefix-majorization test.
  This characterization yields an $O(k'\log k')$ exact feasibility oracle for displacing $k'$ winners, and an $O(k(\log k)^2\log(mx))$ algorithm (via dual-envelope binary search) for computing the maximum achievable displacement $k^\ast$. Experiments on Mallows profiles and PrefLib elections confirm exact cutoffs, diminishing returns, and substantial gains over baseline heuristics; for $g&gt;1$ they also demonstrate the predicted congruence effect, where prefix-only tests produce false positives. The oracle scales to extreme instances, processing $10^9$ candidates in under 28 seconds (memory permitting).</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Non-Discriminatory Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-agent contracts, in which a principal delegates a task to multiple agents and incentivizes them to exert effort. Prior research has mostly focused on maximizing the principal's utility, often resulting in highly disparate payments among agents. Such disparities among agents may be undesirable in practice, for example, in standardized public contracting or worker cooperatives where fairness concerns are essential. Motivated by these considerations, our objective is to quantify the tradeoff between maximizing the principal's utility and equalizing payments among agents, which we call the price of non-discrimination. Our first result is an almost tight bound on the price of non-discrimination, which scales logarithmically with the number of agents. This bound can be improved to a constant by allowing some relaxation of the non-discrimination requirement. We then provide a comprehensive characterization of the tradeoff between the level of non-discrimination and the loss in the optimal utility.</description>

      <title>GameTalk: Training LLMs for Strategic Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.</description>

      <title>Network Security under Heterogeneous Cyber-Risk Profiles and Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber risk has become a critical financial threat in today's interconnected digital economy. This paper introduces a cyber-risk management framework for networked digital systems that combines the strategic behavior of players with contagion dynamics within a security game. We address the problem of optimally allocating cybersecurity resources across a network, focusing on the heterogeneous valuations of nodes by attackers and defenders, some areas may be of high interest to the attacker, while others are prioritized by the defender. We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles. We further propose risk measures based on contagion paths and analyze how propagation dynamics influence optimal defense strategies. Numerical experiments explore risk versus cost efficient frontiers varying network topologies and risk profiles, revealing patterns of resource allocation and cyber deception effects. These findings provide actionable insights for designing resilient digital infrastructures and mitigating systemic cyber risk.</description>

      <title>Fair Division Beyond Monotone Valuations with Applications to Equitable Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies fair division of divisible and indivisible items among agents whose cardinal preferences are not necessarily monotone. We establish the existence of fair divisions and develop approximation algorithms to compute them. We address two complementary valuation classes, subadditive and nonnegative, which go beyond monotone functions. Considering both the division of cake (divisible resources) and allocation of indivisible items, we obtain fairness guarantees in terms of (approximate) envy-freeness (EF) and equability (EQ). In the context of envy-freeness, we prove that an EF division of a cake always exists under cake valuations that are subadditive and globally nonnegative. This result complements the nonexistence of EF allocations for burnt cakes known for more general valuations. In the indivisible-items setting, we establish the existence of EFE3 allocations for subadditive and globally nonnegative valuations. In addition, we obtain universal existence of EFE3 allocations under nonnegative valuations. We study equitability under nonnegative valuations. Here, we prove that EQE3 allocations always exist when the agents' valuations are nonnegative. Also, in the indivisible-items setting, we develop an approximation algorithm that, for given nonnegative valuations, finds allocations that are equitable within additive margins. Our results have combinatorial implications. For instance, the developed results imply the universal existence of proximately dense subgraphs: Given any graph $G=(V, E)$ and integer $k$ (at most $|V|$), there always exists a partition $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k$ of the vertex set such that the edge densities within the parts, $V_i$, are additively within four of each other. Further, such a partition can be computed efficiently.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Uniform Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world pricing mechanisms are typically optimized using training data, a setting corresponding to the \textit{pricing query complexity} problem in Mechanism Design. The previous work [LSTW23] studies the \textit{single-distribution} case, with tight bounds of $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for a \textit{general} distribution and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for either a \textit{regular} or \textit{monotone-hazard-rate (MHR)} distribution, where $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$ denotes the (additive) revenue loss of a learned uniform price relative to the Bayesian-optimal uniform price.
  This can be directly interpreted as ``the query complexity of the {\em \textsf{Uniform Pricing}} mechanism, in the \textit{single-distribution} case''. Yet in the \textit{multi-distribution} case, can the regularity and MHR conditions still lead to improvements over the tight bound $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for general distributions? We answer this question in the negative, by establishing a (near-)matching lower bound $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for either \textit{two regular distributions} or \textit{three MHR distributions}.
  We also address the \textit{regret minimization} problem and, in comparison with the folklore upper bound $\widetilde{O}(T^{2 / 3})$ for general distributions (see, e.g., [SW24]), establish a (near-)matching lower bound $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ for either \textit{two regular distributions} or \textit{three MHR distributions}, via a black-box reduction. Again, this is in stark contrast to the tight bound $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{1 / 2})$ for a single regular or MHR distribution.</description>

      <title>Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation Beyond Identical Valuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: House allocation is an extremely well-studied problem in the field of fair allocation, where the goal is to assign $n$ houses to $n$ agents while satisfying certain fairness criterion, e.g., envy-freeness. To model social interactions, the Graphical House Allocation framework introduces a social graph $G$, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, and an edge $(u, v)$ corresponds to the potential of agent $u$ to envy the agent $v$, based on their allocations and valuations. In undirected social graphs, the potential for envy is in both the directions. In the Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation (ME-GHA) problem, given a set of $n$ agents, $n$ houses, a social graph, and agent's valuation functions, the goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total envy summed up over all the edges of $G$. Recent work, [Hosseini et al., AAMAS 2023, AAMAS 2024] studied ME-GHA in the regime of polynomial-time algorithms, and designed exact and approximation algorithms, for certain graph classes under identical agent valuations. We initiate the study of \gha with non-identical valuations, a setting that has so far remained unexplored. We investigate the multivariate (parameterized) complexity of \gha by identifying structural restrictions on the social graph and valuation functions that yield tractability. We also design moderately exponential-time algorithms for several graph classes, and a polynomial-time algorithm for {binary valuations that returns an allocation with envy at most one when the social graph has maximum degree at most one.</description>

      <title>Quotation-Based Data Retention Mechanism for Data Privacy in LLM-Empowered Network Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) for next-generation network optimization introduces novel data governance challenges. mobile network operators (MNOs) increasingly leverage generative artificial intelligence (AI) for traffic prediction, anomaly detection, and service personalization, requiring access to users' sensitive network usage data-including mobility patterns, traffic types, and location histories. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and similar regulations, users retain the right to withdraw consent and demand data deletion. However, extensive machine unlearning degrades model accuracy and incurs substantial computational costs, ultimately harming network performance for all users. We propose an iterative price discovery mechanism enabling MNOs to compensate users for data retention through sequential price quotations. The server progressively raises the unit price for retaining data while users independently determine their supply at each quoted price. This approach requires no prior knowledge of users' privacy preferences and efficiently maximizes social welfare across the network ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Auto-bidding under Return-on-Spend Constraints with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding systems are widely used in advertising to automatically determine bid values under constraints such as total budget and Return-on-Spend (RoS) targets. Existing works often assume that the value of an ad impression, such as the conversion rate, is known. This paper considers the more realistic scenario where the true value is unknown. We propose a novel method that uses conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of these values based on machine learning methods trained on historical bidding data with contextual features, without assuming the data are i.i.d. This approach is compatible with current industry systems that use machine learning to predict values. Building on prediction intervals, we introduce an adjusted value estimator derived from machine learning predictions, and show that it provides performance guarantees without requiring knowledge of the true value. We apply this method to enhance existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and RoS constraints, and establish theoretical guarantees for achieving high reward while keeping RoS violations low. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our approach improves performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>
