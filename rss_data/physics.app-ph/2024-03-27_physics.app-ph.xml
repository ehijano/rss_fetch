      <title>Topology Optimization for the Full-Cell Design of Porous Electrodes in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a density-based topology optimization framework to design porous electrodes for maximum energy storage. We simulate the full cell with a model that incorporates electronic potential, ionic potential, and electrolyte concentration. The system consists of three materials, namely pure liquid electrolyte and the porous solids of the anode and cathode, for which we determine the optimal placement. We use separate electronic potentials to model each electrode, which allow interdigitated designs. As the result, a penalization is required to ensure that the anode and cathode do not touch, i.e. causing a short circuit. We compare multiple 2D designs generated for different fixed conditions, e.g. material properties. A 3D design with complex channel and interlocking structure is also created. All optimized designs are far superior to the traditional monolithic electrode design with respect to energy storage metrics. We observe up to 750% increase in energy storage for cases with slow effective ionic diffusion within the porous electrode.</description>

      <title>THz probing of non-trivial topological states in Co2MnGe Heusler alloy thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co2MnGe (CMG) has been demonstrated recently as a half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy which possesses a topologically non-trivial band structure. This behavior is unique to such systems and hence warrants extensive experimental exploration for potential spintronic and chirality sensitive optoelectonic applications. Here, we demonstrate that an epitaxial thin film of CMG acts as a source of THz radiation upon photoexcitation by optical femtosecond laser pulses. Detailed experiments have revealed that a large contribution to THz emission occurs due to nonmagnetic or spin-independent origin, however, significant contribution in the THz generation is evidenced through excitation light helicity dependent circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) confirming the presence of topologically non-trivial carriers. Furthermore, we show that not only the topological contribution is easily suppressed but also the overall THz generation efficiency is also affected adversely for the epitaxial films grown at high substrate temperatures.</description>

      <title>Frequency Stable Microwave Sapphire Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that state-of-the-art phase noise and high frequency stability could be simultaneously achieved in a microwave oscillator based on the sapphire-loaded cavity resonator. The 9 GHz sapphire oscillator was constructed with the SSB phase noise close to -170 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 10 kHz and fractional frequency instability less than 2 10$^{-13}$ for integration times from 5 to 50 s. In this work, we focus on the technique for phase-referencing the microwave sapphire oscillator to a stable radio-frequency source. We also discuss the suppression of the fast phase fluctuations of the microwave signal due to its transmission through the high-Q resonator.</description>

      <title>Noise Suppression with Cryogenic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that fast technical fluctuations of microwave signals can be strongly suppressed by cryogenic resonators. The experiments were carried out with sapphire resonators cooled to approximately 6 K at frequencies around 11 GHz. Each sapphire crystal was shaped like a spindle with the rotational and crystal axes aligned within a degree. Noise suppression factors in excess of 50 dB were measured at 10 kHz offset from the carrier. This was achieved by rotating the sapphire spindle and moving the coupling probes relative to its surface. Microwave signals with reduced fast technical fluctuations allow the high-precision tests of fundamental physics, as well as the development of better radars.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticles of NbC produced by laser ablation in liquid: a study of structural, magnetic and superconductivity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium carbide (NbC) is a high-field Type II superconductor with a critical temperature ($T_C$) of 11.1 K, just above that of pure Nb ($T_C = 9$ K). Downsizing NbC to the nanoparticle scale introduces significant alterations in its critical field and/or the superconducting temperature. Here we report on superconducting NbC nanoparticles with $T_C \approx$ 10 K synthesized by laser ablation in acetone, using the lens-target distance (laser fluence) and centrifugation as control parameters of the particle size. X-ray diffraction analyses certified the cubic NbC phase and electron microscopy images revealed spherical particles with average size near 8 nm, with no apparent size dependence on fluence. Besides, magnetization curves exhibited magnetic loops featuring a saturation magnetization around $10^{-3} \mu_B$/molecule along with a small and typical superconducting loop for all investigated samples. We also observed a suppression of the diamagnetic behavior below $T_C$ upon decreasing laser fluence. Moreover, all samples exhibited a weak electron spin resonance (ESR) Curie-like signal at $g\approx2.0$ probably associated with localized defects in the particle's surface. The intriguing coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in nanoparticles has recently garnered significant research attention. This complex scenario and unique properties are due to the substantial increase of surface-to-volume ratio in these superconducting NbC nanoparticles and further investigation would be crucial to unveil novel material properties and shed new light on our understanding of the superconducting phenomenon in this new morphology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid silicon all-optical switching devices integrated with two-dimensional material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate hybrid all-optical switching devices that combine silicon nanocavities and two-dimensional semiconductor material. By exploiting the refractive index modulation caused by photo-induced carriers in the two-dimensional material instead of the silicon substrate, we overcome the switching performance limitation imposed by the substrate material. Air-mode photonic crystal nanobeam cavities capable of efficient interaction with two-dimensional materials are fabricated, and molybdenum ditelluride, a two-dimensional material with rapid carrier recombination, is transferred onto the cavities. The molybdenum ditelluride flake is excited by an optical pump pulse to shift the resonant wavelength of the cavity for switching operation. We have successfully achieved all-optical switching operations on the time scale of tens of picoseconds while requiring low switching energies of a few hundred femtojoules.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Time-Resolved Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale carrier dynamics induced by light excitation is the key to unlocking futuristic devices and innovative functionalities in advanced materials. Optical pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (OPP-STM) has opened a window to these phenomena. However, mastering the combination of ultrafast pulsed lasers with STM requires high expertise and effort. We have shattered this barrier and developed a compact OPP-STM system accessible to all. This system precisely controls laser pulse timing electrically and enables stable laser irradiation on sample surfaces. Furthermore, by applying this technique to atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have captured time-resolved force signals with an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio. Originating from the dipole-dipole interactions, these signals provide insights into the carrier dynamics on sample surfaces, which are activated by photo-illumination. These technologies are promising as powerful tools for exploring a wide range of photoinduced phenomena in conductive and insulating materials.</description>

      <title>Damage Mechanics Challenge: Predictions based on the phase field fracture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our contribution to the Purdue-SANDIA-LLNL \emph{Damage Mechanics Challenge}. The phase field fracture model is adopted to blindly estimate the failure characteristics of the challenge test, an unconventional three-point bending experiment on an additively manufactured rock resembling a type of gypsum. The model is formulated in a variationally consistent fashion, incorporating a volumetric-deviatoric strain energy decomposition, and the numerical implementation adopts a monolithic unconditionally stable solution scheme. Our focus is on providing an efficient and simple yet rigorous approach capable of delivering accurate predictions based solely on physical parameters. Model inputs are Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\nu$, toughness $G_c$ and strength $\sigma_c$ (as determined by the choice of phase field length scale $\ell$). We show that a single mode I three-point bending test is sufficient to calibrate the model, and that the calibrated model can then reliably predict the force versus displacement responses, crack paths and surface crack morphologies of more intricate three-point bending experiments that are inherently mixed-mode. Importantly, our peak load, crack trajectory and crack surface morphology predictions for the challenge test, submitted before the experimental data was released, show a remarkable agreement with experiments. The characteristics of the challenge, and how changes in these can impact the predictive abilities of phase field fracture models, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics and data driven model for prediction of residual stresses in machining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting residual stresses has always been a topic of significance due to its implications in the development of enhanced materials and better processing conditions. In this work, an analytical model for prediction of residual stresses is developed for orthogonal machining. It consists of three component models for force, temperature and stress computation. The Oxley force model and Waldorf's slip-line model are employed for obtaining cutting force, thrust force, and temperatures at the shear zone and tool-chip interface for the given parameters. The Komanduri-Hou two heat source model is used for obtaining the temperature distribution in the workpiece. The effect of coolant with differing mass flow rates has also been incorporated. The residual stresses are obtained by combining the mechanical and thermal components, followed by the loading and relaxation of the stresses. Optimal values for unknown parameters are predicted by leveraging a cost function. The residual stress distributions obtained give a tensile region near the surface for Inconel 718, and a compressive region for Ti6Al4V, which are in line with experimental results found in literature.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of THz Radiation in Laser-Plasma Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.</description>

      <title>Ferroelastic control of magnetic domain structure: direct imaging by Magnetic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrrhotite, Fe$_7$S$_8$, provides an example of exceptionally strong magnetoelastic coupling through pinning of ferromagnetic domains by ferroelastic twins. Using direct imaging of both magnetic and ferroelastic domains by magnetic force microscopy (MFM), the mechanism by which this coupling controls local magnetic switching behaviour of regions on the pyrrhotite surface is revealed, and leads to quantitative fitting of field dependent MFM phase shifts with bulk magnetometry data. It is shown that characteristic inflection points in the magnetometry data along certain direction, in particular $[\overline 120]^*_h$ of the hexagonal parent structure, are in fact caused by ferroelastic pinning of the magnetic moments.</description>
