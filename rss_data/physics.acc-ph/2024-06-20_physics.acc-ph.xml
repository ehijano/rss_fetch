      <title>Towards Unlocking Insights from Logbooks Using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic logbooks contain valuable information about activities and events concerning their associated particle accelerator facilities. However, the highly technical nature of logbook entries can hinder their usability and automation. As natural language processing (NLP) continues advancing, it offers opportunities to address various challenges that logbooks present. This work explores jointly testing a tailored Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model for enhancing the usability of particle accelerator logbooks at institutes like DESY, BESSY, Fermilab, BNL, SLAC, LBNL, and CERN. The RAG model uses a corpus built on logbook contributions and aims to unlock insights from these logbooks by leveraging retrieval over facility datasets, including discussion about potential multimodal sources. Our goals are to increase the FAIR-ness (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) of logbooks by exploiting their information content to streamline everyday use, enable macro-analysis for root cause analysis, and facilitate problem-solving automation.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a Welding Procedure for Making Critical Aluminum Welds on the LBNF Absorber Core Block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LBNF Absorber consists of thirteen 6061-T6 aluminum core blocks. The core blocks are water cooled with de-ionized (DI) water which becomes radioactive during beam operations. The cooling water flows through gun-drilled channels in the core blocks. A weld quality optimization was performed to produce National Aeronautical Standard 1514 Class I quality welds on the aluminum core blocks. This was not successful in all cases. An existing Gas Tungsten Arc Welding Procedure Specification was fine tuned to minimize, in most cases, and eliminate detect-able tungsten inclusions in the welds. All the weld coupons, however passed welding inspection as per the piping code: ASME B31.3 Normal Fluid Service. Tungsten electrode diameter, type, and manufacturer were varied. Some of the samples were pre-heated and others were not. It was observed that larger diameter electrodes, 5/32 in., with pre-heated joints resulted in welds with the least number of tungsten inclusions. It is hypothesized that thinner electrodes breakdown easily and get lodged into the weld pool during the welding process. This breakdown is further enhanced by the large temperature differential between the un-preheated sample and the hot electrode.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Efficiency Microwave Heating Producing Record Highly Charged Xenon Ion Beams with Superconducting ECR Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New algorithms useful for the calculation of dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance in circular accelerators are developed and presented. The flood-fill tool from raster graphics inspired us to efficiently compute dynamic apertures by minimizing required trackings on stable initial coordinates, leading to several factors of speed-up with respect to standard algorithms. A novel technique for momentum acceptance calculations, Fast Touschek Tracking, is developed. Thorough benchmarking using modern accelerator codes shows that the new technique can provide one or two orders of magnitude faster computation of local momentum acceptances with only limited loss of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Development of RFSoC-based direct sampling highly multiplexed microwave SQUID readout for future CMB and submillimeter surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SLAC Microresonator Radio Frequency (SMuRF) electronics is being deployed as the readout for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) telescopes of the Simons Observatory (SO). A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) based readout of microwave frequency resonator based cryogenic sensors is under development at SLAC as an upgrade path for SMuRF with simplified RF hardware, a more compact footprint, and lower total power consumption. The high-speed integrated data converters and digital data path in RFSoC enable direct RF sampling without analog up and down conversion for RF frequencies up to 6 GHz. A comprehensive optimization and characterization study has been performed for direct RF sampling for microwave SQUID multiplexers, which covers noise level, RF dynamic range, and linearity using a prototype implementation. The SMuRF firmware, including the implementation of closed-loop tone tracking, has been ported to the RFSoC platform and interfaced with the quadrature mixers for digital up and down conversion in the data converter data path to realize a full microwave SQUID multiplexer readout. In this paper, a selection of the performance characterization results of direct RF sampling for microwave SQUID multiplexer readout will be summarized and compared with science-driven requirements. Preliminary results demonstrating the read out of cryogenic sensors using the prototype system will also be presented here. We anticipate our new RFSoC-based SMuRF system will be an enabling readout for on-going and future experiments in astronomy and cosmology, which rely on large arrays of cryogenic sensors to achieve their science goals.</description>

      <title>Enhanced beam-beam modeling to include longitudinal variation during weak-strong simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam-beam interactions pose substantial challenges in the design and operation of circular colliders, significantly affecting their performance. In particular, the weak-strong simulation approach is pivotal for investigating single-particle dynamics during the collider design phase. This paper evaluates the limitations of existing models in weak-strong simulations, noting that while they accurately account for energy changes due to slingshot effects, they fail to incorporate longitudinal coordinate changes ($z$-variation). To address this gap, we introduce two novel transformations that enhance Hirata's original framework by including both $z$-variation and slingshot effect-induced energy changes. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and extensive weak-strong simulation studies, we validate the efficacy of these enhancements in achieving a more precise simulation of beam-beam interactions. Our results reveal that although $z$-variation constitutes a higher-order effect and does not substantially affect the emittance growth rate within the specific design parameters of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the refined model offers improved accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving the interaction between beam-beam effects and other random diffusion processes, as well as in simulations incorporating realistic lattice models.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of FEL-generated THz waves using planar and helical undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission of terahertz waves in free electron lasers (FELs) with both planar (linear) and helical undulators has been explored. The analysis employs Lienard-Wiechert fields to characterize FEL radiation within the THz region. Specifically, the study delves into the analytical examination of radiation pattern of THz waves, which provides insight into the angular distribution of radiation energy. The variations of radiation pattern for various parameters such as different harmonics, Lorentz factor, magnetic parameter, and total number of periods of planar and helical undulators were investigated. The Fourier transform of free electron laser electric field is showcased across four distinct sets of FEL parameters. The interplay between electron beam and undulators parameters sheds light on how these factors influence the directionality of THz waves. Simulation results indicate that planar undulators often produce radiation with noticeable side lobes, especially at higher harmonics, while helical undulators typically exhibit reduced side lobes, resulting in a more focused main radiation peak. However, the radiation pattern of THz waves tends to concentrate predominantly in the forward direction and the polarization of the emitted radiation is determined by the properties of the undulator and electron beam, rather than the specific undulator geometry. The study underscores that an optimal selection of undulator and beam parameters can effectively maximize the angular distribution of emitted radiation.</description>

      <title>Generation of THz waves through interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study explores radiation in THz spectrum region through the interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma. The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.</description>
