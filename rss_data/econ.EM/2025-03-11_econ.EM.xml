      <title>Bounding the Effect of Persuasion with Monotonicity Assumptions: Reassessing the Impact of TV Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Televised debates between presidential candidates are often regarded as the exemplar of persuasive communication. Yet, recent evidence from Le Pennec and Pons (2023) indicates that they may not sway voters as strongly as popular belief suggests. We revisit their findings through the lens of the persuasion rate and introduce a robust framework that does not require exogenous treatment, parallel trends, or credible instruments. Instead, we leverage plausible monotonicity assumptions to partially identify the persuasion rate and related parameters. Our results reaffirm that the sharp upper bounds on the persuasive effects of TV debates remain modest.</description>

      <title>Singularity-Based Consistent QML Estimation of Multiple Breakpoints in High-Dimensional Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the estimation of high-dimensional factor models in which factor loadings undergo an unknown number of structural changes over time. Given that a model with multiple changes in factor loadings can be observationally indistinguishable from one with constant loadings but varying factor variances, this reduces the high-dimensional structural change problem to a lower-dimensional one. Due to the presence of multiple breakpoints, the factor space may expand, potentially causing the pseudo factor covariance matrix within some regimes to be singular. We define two types of breakpoints: {\bf a singular change}, where the number of factors in the combined regime exceeds the minimum number of factors in the two separate regimes, and {\bf a rotational change}, where the number of factors in the combined regime equals that in each separate regime. Under a singular change, we derive the properties of the small eigenvalues and establish the consistency of the QML estimators. Under a rotational change, unlike in the single-breakpoint case, the pseudo factor covariance matrix within each regime can be either full rank or singular, yet the QML estimation error for the breakpoints remains stably bounded. We further propose an information criterion (IC) to estimate the number of breakpoints and show that, with probability approaching one, it accurately identifies the true number of structural changes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm strong finite-sample performance. Finally, we apply our method to the FRED-MD dataset, identifying five structural breaks in factor loadings between 1959 and 2024.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Temperature Sensitivity of Residential Electricity Demand: Evidence from a Distributional Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the temperature sensitivity of residential electricity demand during extreme temperature events using the distribution-to-scalar regression model. Rather than relying on simple averages or individual quantile statistics of raw temperature data, we construct distributional summaries, such as probability density, hazard rate, and quantile functions, to retain a more comprehensive representation of temperature variation. This approach not only utilizes richer information from the underlying temperature distribution but also enables the examination of extreme temperature effects that conventional models fail to capture. Additionally, recognizing that distribution functions are typically estimated from limited discrete observations and may be subject to measurement errors, our econometric framework explicitly addresses this issue. Empirical findings from the hazard-to-demand model indicate that residential electricity demand exhibits a stronger nonlinear response to cold waves than to heat waves, while heat wave shocks demonstrate a more pronounced incremental effect. Moreover, the temperature quantile-to-demand model produces largely insignificant demand response estimates, attributed to the offsetting influence of two counteracting forces.</description>

      <title>How Do Consumers Really Choose: Exposing Hidden Preferences with the Mixture of Experts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding consumer choice is fundamental to marketing and management research, as firms increasingly seek to personalize offerings and optimize customer engagement. Traditional choice modeling frameworks, such as multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit models, impose rigid parametric assumptions that limit their ability to capture the complexity of consumer decision-making. This study introduces the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework as a machine learning-driven alternative that dynamically segments consumers based on latent behavioral patterns. By leveraging probabilistic gating functions and specialized expert networks, MoE provides a flexible, nonparametric approach to modeling heterogeneous preferences.
  Empirical validation using large-scale retail data demonstrates that MoE significantly enhances predictive accuracy over traditional econometric models, capturing nonlinear consumer responses to price variations, brand preferences, and product attributes. The findings underscore MoEs potential to improve demand forecasting, optimize targeted marketing strategies, and refine segmentation practices. By offering a more granular and adaptive framework, this study bridges the gap between data-driven machine learning approaches and marketing theory, advocating for the integration of AI techniques in managerial decision-making and strategic consumer insights.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Synthetic Control with a Soft Simplex Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the synthetic control method should be implemented with the simplex constraint and how to implement it in a high-dimensional setting have been widely discussed. To address both issues simultaneously, we propose a novel Bayesian synthetic control method that integrates a soft simplex constraint with spike-and-slab variable selection. Our model is featured by a hierarchical prior capturing how well the data aligns with the simplex assumption, which enables our method to efficiently adapt to the structure and information contained in the data by utilizing the constraint in a more flexible and data-driven manner. A unique computational challenge posed by our model is that conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for Bayesian variable selection are no longer applicable, since the soft simplex constraint results in an intractable marginal likelihood. To tackle this challenge, we propose to update the regression coefficients of two predictors simultaneously from their full conditional posterior distribution, which has an explicit but highly complicated characterization. This novel Gibbs updating scheme leads to an efficient Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler that enables effective posterior sampling from our model and accurate estimation of the average treatment effect. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method performs well across a wide range of settings, in terms of both variable selection and treatment effect estimation, even when the true data-generating process does not adhere to the simplex constraint. Finally, application of our method to two empirical examples in the economic literature yields interesting insights into the impact of economic policies.</description>

      <title>Factor Network Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02925v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a factor network autoregressive (FNAR) model for time series with complex network structures. The coefficients of the model reflect many different types of connections between economic agents ("multilayer network"), which are summarized into a smaller number of network matrices ("network factors") through a novel tensor-based principal component approach. We provide consistency and asymptotic normality results for the estimation of the factors, their loadings, and the coefficients of the FNAR, as the number of layers, nodes and time points diverges to infinity. Our approach combines two different dimension-reduction techniques and can be applied to high-dimensional datasets. Simulation results show the goodness of our estimators in finite samples. In an empirical application, we use the FNAR to investigate the cross-country interdependence of GDP growth rates based on a variety of international trade and financial linkages. The model provides a rich characterization of macroeconomic network effects as well as good forecasts of GDP growth rates.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of One-Sided Representations for the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) under the assumption that the dynamic common component is purely non-deterministic. We show that, under thisassumption, the common shocks - and consequently, the dynamic common component - can be represented in terms of current and past observed variables. This generalises existing results on the so-called "One-Sidedness Problem" of the GDFM.</description>

      <title>Moments by the Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Population Causal Inference for Models of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to problems of interference in (exogenous) treatments, models of interference in unit-specific (endogenous) outcomes do not usually produce a reduced-form representation where outcomes depend on other units' treatment status only at a short network distance, or only through a known exposure mapping. This remains true if the structural mechanism depends on outcomes of peers only at a short network distance, or through a known exposure mapping. In this paper, we first define causal estimands that are identified and estimable from a single experiment on the network under minimal assumptions on the structure of interference, and which represent average partial causal responses which generally vary with other global features of the realized assignment. Under a fixed-population, design-based approach, we show unbiasedness and consistency for inverse-probability weighting (IPW) estimators for those causal parameters from a randomized experiment on a single network. We also analyze more closely the case of marginal interventions in a model of equilibrium with smooth response functions where we can recover LATE-type weighted averages of derivatives of those response functions. Under additional structural assumptions, these "agnostic" causal estimands can be combined to recover model parameters, but also retain their less restrictive causal interpretation.</description>

      <title>Option Pricing with Time-Varying Volatility Risk Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06943v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pricing kernel with time-varying volatility risk aversion to explain observed time variations in the shape of the pricing kernel. When combined with the Heston-Nandi GARCH model, this framework yields a tractable option pricing model in which the variance risk ratio (VRR) emerges as a key variable. We show that the VRR is closely linked to economic fundamentals, as well as sentiment and uncertainty measures. A novel approximation method provides analytical option pricing formulas, and we demonstrate substantial reductions in pricing errors through an empirical application to the S&amp;P 500 index, the CBOE VIX, and option prices.</description>
