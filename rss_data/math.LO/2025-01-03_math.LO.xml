      <title>Semi-Substructural Logics \`a la Lambek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the proof theory of left (right) skew monoidal closed categories and skew monoidal bi-closed categories from the perspective of  non-associative Lambek calculus. Skew monoidal closed categories represent a relaxed version of monoidal closed categories, where the structural laws are not invertible; instead, they are natural transformations with a specific orientation. Uustalu et al. used sequents with stoup (the leftmost position of an antecedent that can be either empty or a single formula) to deductively model left skew monoidal closed categories, yielding results regarding proof identities and categorical coherence. However, their syntax does not work well when modeling right skew monoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed categories.
  We solve the problem by constructing cut-free sequent calculi for left skew monoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed categories, reminiscent of non-associative Lambek calculus, with trees as antecedents. Each calculus is respectively equivalent to the sequent calculus with stoup (for left skew monoidal categories) and the axiomatic calculus (for skew monoidal bi-closed categories). Moreover, we prove that the latter calculus is sound and complete with respect to its relational models. We also prove a correspondence between frame conditions and structural laws, providing an algebraic way to understand the relationship between the left and right skew monoidal (closed) categories.</description>

      <title>A choice-free proof of Mal'cev's theorem on quasivarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Mal'cev proved that a class $\mathcal{K}$ of first-order structures with a specified signature is a quasivariety if and only if $\mathcal{K}$ contains a unit and is closed under isomorphisms, substructures, and reduced products. In this article, we present a proof of this theorem in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).</description>

      <title>Green points in the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an expansion of a real closed field by a multiplicative subgroup adapting Poizat's theory of green points. Its theory is strongly dependent, and every open set definable in a model of this theory is semialgebraic. We prove that the real field with a dense family of logarithmic spirals, proposed by Zilber, satisfies our theory.</description>

      <title>Foulis m-semilattices and their modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the results of Jacobs, we show that the category OMLatLin of orthomodular lattices and linear maps forms a dagger category. For each orthomodular lattice X, we construct a Foulis m-semilattice Lin(X) composed of endomorphisms of X. This m-semilattice acts as a quantale, enabling us to regard X as a left Lin(X)-module. Our novel approach introduces a fuzzy-theoretic dimension to the theory of orthomodular lattices.</description>

      <title>Computability of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that techniques of Weihrauch complexity can be used to get easy and elegant proofs of known and new results on initial value problems. Our main result is that solving continuous initial value problems is Weihrauch equivalent to weak K\H{o}nig's lemma, even if only solutions with maximal domains of existence are considered. This result simultaneously generalizes negative and positive results by Aberth and by Collins and Gra\c{c}a, respectively. It can also be seen as a uniform version of a Theorem of Simpson. Beyond known techniques we exploit for the proof that weak K\H{o}nig's lemma is closed under infinite loops. One corollary of our main result is that solutions with maximal domain of existence of continuous initial value problems can be computed non-deterministically, and for computable instances there are always solutions that are low as points in the function space. Another corollary is that in the case that there is a fixed finite number of solutions, these solutions are all computable for computable instances and they can be found uniformly in a finite mind-change computation.</description>

      <title>Information geometry for types in the large-$n$ limit of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Accessible operators on ultraproducts of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a question by Henry Towsner about the possibility of representing linear operators between ultraproducts of Banach spaces by means of ultraproducts of nonlinear maps. We provide a bridge between these "accessible" operators and the theory of twisted sums through the so-called quasilinear maps. Thus, for many pairs of Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, there is an "accessible" operator $X_U\to Y_U$ that is not the ultraproduct of a family of operators $X\to Y$ if and only if there is a short exact sequence of quasi-Banach spaces and operators $0\to Y\to Z\to X\to 0$ that does not split. We then adapt classical work by Ribe and Kalton--Peck to exhibit pretty concrete examples of accessible functionals and endomorphisms for the sequence spaces $\ell_p$. The paper is organized so that the main ideas are accessible to readers working on ultraproducts and requires only a rustic knowledge of Banach space theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of elementary equivalence of the free group factors, that is, do all free group factors $L(\mathbb{F}_n)$ share a common first-order theory? We establish a trichotomy of possibilities for their common first-order fundamental group, as well as several possible avenues for establishing a dichotomy in direct analog to the free group factor alternative of Dykema and Radulescu. We also show that the $\forall \exists$-theories of the interpolated free group factors are increasing, and use this to establish that the dichotomy holds on the level of $\forall \exists$-theories. We conclude with some observations on related problems.</description>

      <title>Agent-Knowledge Logic for Alternative Epistemic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epistemic logic is known as a logic that captures the knowledge and beliefs of agents and has undergone various developments since Hintikka (1962). In this paper, we propose a new logic called agent-knowledge logic by taking the product of individual knowledge structures and the set of relationships among agents. This logic is based on the Facebook logic proposed by Seligman et al. (2011) and the Logic of Hide and Seek Game proposed by Li et al. (2021). We show two main results; one is that this logic can embed the standard epistemic logic, and the other is that there is a proof system of tableau calculus that works in finite time. We also discuss various sentences and inferences that this logic can express.</description>

      <title>Forcing as a Local Method of Accessing Small Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a set-theoretic universe $V$. We look at small extensions of $V$ as generalised degrees of computability over $V$. We also formalise and investigate the complexity of certain methods one can use to define, in $V$, subclasses of degrees over $V$. Finally, we give a nice characterisation of the complexity of forcing within this framework.</description>

      <title>Existence of a Model of $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$ from Failure of GCH at a Measurable Cardinal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the consistency strength of the GCH failing at a measurable cardinal is the existence of a cardinal $\kappa$ with $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$. As the literature does not contain more than a proof sketch of the lower bound of this equiconsistency, we give an expository proof which fills in the details in order to fill this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the Elementary Equivalence of Group Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use techniques of distortion systems, introduced by James Hanson to show that any two elementarily equivalent infinite discrete ICC groups give rise to elementarily equivalent group von Neumann algebras. This answers a question raised by Goldbring-Pi (and attributed there to Koichi Oyakawa), in the negative. In a special case, this resolves the model theoretic free factor isomorphism problem.</description>
