      <title>Profinite completions of products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A source of difficulty in profinite homotopy theory is that the profinite completion functor does not preserve finite products. In this note, we provide a new, checkable criterion on prospaces $X$ and $Y$ that guarantees that the profinite completion of $X\times Y$ agrees with the product of the profinite completions of $X$ and $Y$. Using this criterion, we show that profinite completion preserves products of \'{e}tale homotopy types of qcqs schemes. This fills a gap in Chough's proof of the K\"{u}nneth formula for the \'{e}tale homotopy type of a product of proper schemes over a separably closed field.</description>

      <title>The universal property of bordism of commuting involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formalism to capture the structure of the equivariant bordism rings of smooth manifolds with commuting involutions. We introduce the concept of an oriented el$_2^{RO}$-algebra, an algebraic structure featuring representation graded rings for all elementary abelian 2-groups, connected by restriction homomorphisms, a pre-Euler class, and an inverse Thom class; this data is subject to one exactness property. Besides equivariant bordism, oriented global ring spectra also give rise to oriented el$_2^{RO}$-algebras, so examples abound. Inverting the inverse Thom classes yields a global 2-torsion group law. In this sense, our oriented el$_2^{RO}$-algebras are delocalized generalizations of global 2-torsion group laws.
  Our main result shows that equivariant bordism for elementary abelian 2-groups is an initial oriented el$_2^{RO}$-algebra. Several other interesting equivariant homology theories can also be characterized, on elementary abelian 2-groups, by similar universal properties. We prove that stable equivariant bordism is an initial el$_2^{RO}$-algebra with an invertible orientation; that Bredon homology with constant mod 2 coefficients is an initial el$_2^{RO}$-algebra with an additive orientation; and that Borel equivariant homology with mod 2 coefficients is an initial el$_2^{RO}$-algebra with an orientation that is both additive and invertible.</description>

      <title>Link Bundles and Intersection Spaces of Complex Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist several homology theories for singular spaces that satisfy generalized Poincar\'e duality, including Goresky-MacPherson's intersection homology, Cheeger's $L^2$ cohomology and the homology of intersection spaces. The intersection homology and $L^2$ cohomology of toric varieties is known. Here, we compute the rational homology of intersection spaces of complex 3-dimensional toric varieties and compare it to intersection homology. To achieve this, we analyze cell structures and topological stratifications of these varieties and determine compatible structures on their singularity links. In particular, we compute the homology of links in 3-dimensional toric varieties. We find it convenient to use the concept of a rational homology stratification. It turns out that the intersection space homology of a toric variety, contrary to its intersection homology, is not combinatorially invariant and thus retains more refined information on the defining fan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an example of duoidal $\infty$-categories. We introduce map $\mathcal{O}$-monoidales in an $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category for an $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}^{\otimes}$. We show that the endomorphism mapping $\infty$-category of a map $\mathcal{O}$-monoidale is a coCartesian $(\Delta^{\rm op},\mathcal{O})$-duoidal $\infty$-category. After that, we introduce a convolution product on the mapping $\infty$-category from an $\mathcal{O}$-comonoidale to an $\mathcal{O}$-monoidale. We show that the $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal structure on the duoidal endomorphism mapping $\infty$-category of a map $\mathcal{O}$-monoidale is equivalent to the convolution product on the mapping $\infty$-category from the dual $\mathcal{O}$-comonoidale to the map $\mathcal{O}$-monoidale.</description>

Abstract: Tsuboi proved that the Calabi invariant of the closed disk transgresses to the Euler class of foliated circle bundles and suggested looking for its higher-dimensional analog. In this paper, we construct a cohomology class of the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a real-cohomologically acyclic manifold with sphere boundary, which is closely related to McDuff's secondary class, and prove that this cohomology class transgresses to the Euler class of foliated sphere bundles.</description>

      <title>Structural characterizations and Obstructions to Planar-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a scale parameter $r&gt;0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (referred to as planar-Rips complex) under the usual Euclidean metric is a (finite) simplicial complex whose simplices are subsets of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. This paper focuses on characterizing the simplicial complexes that can or cannot be realized as planar-Rips complexes. Building on the prior work of Adamszek et al., we classify, up to simplicial isomorphism, all $n$-dimensional pseudomanifolds and weak-pseudomanifolds that admit a planar-Rips structure, and further characterize two-dimensional, pure, and closed planar-Rips complexes. Additionally, the notion of obstructions to planar-Rips complexes has been introduced, laying the groundwork for algorithmic approaches to identifying forbidden planar-Rips structures. We also explore the correlations between planar-Rips complexes and the class of intersection graphs called disk graphs, establishing a natural isomorphism between the two classes. Parallelly, our findings on planar-Rips complexes have been consolidated in terms of unit disk graphs for interested readers, depicting the significance of the topological and algebraic approaches. Several structural and geometric properties of planar-Rips complexes have been derived that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Scale-Free Image Keypoints Using Differentiable Persistent Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computer vision, keypoint detection is a fundamental task, with applications spanning from robotics to image retrieval; however, existing learning-based methods suffer from scale dependency and lack flexibility. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Morse theory and persistent homology, powerful tools rooted in algebraic topology. We propose a novel loss function based on the recent introduction of a notion of subgradient in persistent homology, paving the way toward topological learning. Our detector, MorseDet, is the first topology-based learning model for feature detection, which achieves competitive performance in keypoint repeatability and introduces a principled and theoretically robust approach to the problem.</description>

Abstract: We define groupoidal and $(n+k)$-truncated $n$-quasi-categories, which are the translation to the world of $n$-quasi-categories of groupoidal and truncated $(\infty, n)$-$\Theta$-spaces defined by Rezk. We show that these objects are the fibrant objects of model structures on the category of presheaves on $\Theta_n$ obtained by localisation of Ara's model structure for $n$-quasi-categories. Furthermore, we prove that the inclusion $\Delta \to \Theta_n$ induces a Quillen equivalence between the model structure for groupoidal (resp. and $n$-truncated) $n$-quasi-categories and the Kan-Quillen model structure for spaces (resp. homotopy $n$-types) on simplicial sets. To get to these results, we also construct a cylinder object for $n$-quasi-categories.</description>

Abstract: For a compact orientable surface $\Sigma_{g,1}$ of genus $g$ with one boundary component and for an odd prime number $p$, we study the homology of the unordered configuration spaces $C_\bullet(\Sigma_{g,1}):=\coprod_{n\ge0}C_n(\Sigma_{g,1})$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$. We describe $H_*(C_\bullet(\Sigma_{g,1});\mathbb{F}_p)$ as a bigraded module over the Pontryagin ring $H_*(C_\bullet(D);\mathbb{F}_p)$, where $D$ is a disc, and compute in particular the bigraded dimension over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We also consider the action of the mapping class group $\Gamma_{g,1}$, and prove that the mod-$p$ Johnson kernel $\mathcal{K}_{g,1}(p)\subseteq\Gamma_{g,1}$ is the kernel of the action on $H_*(C_\bullet(\Sigma_{g,1};\mathbb{F}_p))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using higher descent for chromatically localized algebraic $K$-theory, we show that the higher semiadditive cardinality of a $\pi$-finite $p$-space $A$ at the Lubin-Tate spectrum $E_n$ is equal to the higher semiadditive cardinality of the free loop space $LA$ at $E_{n-1}$. By induction, it is thus equal to the homotopy cardinality of the $n$-fold free loop space $L^n A$. We explain how this allows one to bypass the Ravenel-Wilson computation in the proof of the $\infty$-semiadditivity of the $T(n)$-local categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstandard extension of the category of diffeological spaces, and demonstrate its application to the study of generalized functions. Just as diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of Euclidean open sets, our nonstandard diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of open subsets of nonstandard Euclidean spaces, i.e. finite dimensional vector spaces over (the quasi-asymptotic variant of) Robinson's hyperreal numbers. It is shown that nonstandard diffeological spaces form a category which is enriched over the category of diffeological spaces, is closed under small limits and colimits, and is cartesian closed. Furthermore, it can be shown that the space of nonstandard functions on the extension of a Euclidean open set is a smooth differential algebra that admits an embedding of the differential vector space of Schwartz distributions. Since our algebra of generalized functions comes as a hom-object in a category, it enables not only the multiplication of distributions but also the composition of them. To illustrate the usefulness of this property we show that the homotopy extension property can be established for smooth relative cell complexes by exploiting extended maps.</description>

Abstract: Let the circle group act on a 6-dimensional compact oriented manifold $M$ with isolated fixed points. The fixed point data of $M$ is the collection of signs and weights at the fixed points. To classify such a manifold $M$, the fixed point data is an essential information. Under an assumption that each isotropy submanifold is orientable, we classify the fixed point data of $M$, by showing that we can convert it to the empty collection by performing a combination of a number of types of operations. We do so by proving that we can successively take equivariant connected sums of $M$ at fixed points with $S^6$, $\mathbb{CP}^3$, and 6-dimensional analogue $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ of the Hirzebruch surfaces (and these with opposite orientations), to a fixed point free action on a compact oriented 6-manifold.</description>

      <title>Graphs for torus actions on oriented manifolds with isolated fixed points and classification in dimension 6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let a torus act on a compact oriented manifold $M$ with isolated fixed points, with an additional mild assumption that its isotropy submanifolds are orientable. We associate a signed labeled multigraph encoding the fixed point data (weights and signs at fixed points and isotropy submanifolds) of the manifold. We study operations on $M$ and its multigraph, (self) connected sum and blow up, etc. When the circle group acts on a 6-dimensional $M$, we classify such a multigraph by proving that we can convert it into the empty graph by successively applying two types of operations. In particular, this classifies the fixed point data of any such manifold. We prove this by showing that for any such manifold, we can successively take equivariant connected sums at fixed points with itself, $\mathbb{CP}^3$, and 6-dimensional analogue $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ of the Hirzebruch surfaces (and these with opposite orientations) to a fixed point free action on a compact oriented 6-manifold. We also classify a multigraph for a torus action on a 4-dimensional $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a higher covering diagram in a base $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. The theory of higher covering diagrams in $\mathcal{C}$ will be shown to recover various descent conditions known from the $\infty$-categorical literature in a uniform manner. In fact, higher covering diagrams always assemble to what we refer to as a structured colimit pre-topology on the base $\mathcal{C}$. It hence always defines a sub-canonical sheaf theory over $\mathcal{C}$, and indeed defines the canonical such whenever $\mathcal{C}$ has pullbacks. This ``higher geometric'' sheaf theory will be shown to differ from the usual infinitary-coherent sheaf theory by a cotopological localization whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is infinitary-coherent itself. We prove that this localization is generally non-trivial. For instance, every $\infty$-topos is the theory of higher geometric sheaves over itself, but the according infinitary-coherent sheaf theory over it is generally strictly larger. The higher geometric sheaves are hence characterized by a limit preservation property that is generally not captured by the classical sheaf condition. We define an $\infty$-category of higher geometric $\infty$-categories, and show that the (opposite of the) $\infty$-category of $\infty$-toposes embeds fully faithfully therein. We show that the higher $\kappa$-geometric sheaf theory on a higher $\kappa$-geometric $\infty$-category defines the free $\infty$-topos generated by it, and consequently that it faithfully generalizes Lurie's definition of a ``sheaf'' over an $\infty$-topos.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Persistent Homology in Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently shown strong empirical performance in the context of graph classification. Being able to capture long range graph properties via higher-order topological features, such as cycles of arbitrary length, in combination with multi-scale topological descriptors, has improved predictive performance for data sets with prominent topological structures, such as molecules. At the same time, the theoretical properties of persistent homology have not been formally assessed in this context. This paper intends to bridge the gap between computational topology and graph machine learning by providing a brief introduction to persistent homology in the context of graphs, as well as a theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity for graph learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: We give a construction of the spinor bundle of the loop space of a string manifold together with its fusion product, inspired by ideas from Stolz and Teichner. The spinor bundle is a super bimodule bundle for a bundle of Clifford von Neumann algebras over the free path space, and the fusion product is defined using Connes fusion of such bimodules. As the main result, we prove that a spinor bundle with fusion product on a manifold X exists if and only X admits a string structure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>

Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Multiverse of Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echoing recent calls to counter reliability and robustness concerns in machine learning via multiverse analysis, we present PRESTO, a principled framework for mapping the multiverse of machine-learning models that rely on latent representations. Although such models enjoy widespread adoption, the variability in their embeddings remains poorly understood, resulting in unnecessary complexity and untrustworthy representations. Our framework uses persistent homology to characterize the latent spaces arising from different combinations of diverse machine-learning methods, (hyper)parameter configurations, and datasets, allowing us to measure their pairwise (dis)similarity and statistically reason about their distributions. As we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically, our pipeline preserves desirable properties of collections of latent representations, and it can be leveraged to perform sensitivity analysis, detect anomalous embeddings, or efficiently and effectively navigate hyperparameter search spaces.</description>

      <title>Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an emerging trend to integrate persistent homology (PH) into graph neural networks (GNNs) to enrich expressive power. However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Representation stability in the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements associated to irreducible representations of the symmetric-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the most classically relevant Hyperplane arrangements are the Braid Arrangements $B_n$ and their associated compliment spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$. In their recent work, Tsilevich, Vershik, and Yuzvinsky construct what they refer to as the intrinsic hyperplane arrangement within any irreducible representation of the symmetric group that generalize the classical braid arrangements. Through examples it is also shown that the associated compliment spaces to these intrinsic arrangements display behaviors far removed from $\mathcal{F}_n$. In this work we study the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements of irreducible representations of the symmetric group from the perspective of representation stability. This work is both theoretical, proving representation stability theorems for hyperplane complements, as well as statistical, examining the outputs of a number of simulations designed to enumerate flats.</description>
