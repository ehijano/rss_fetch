      <title>The mapping properties of fractional derivatives in weighted fractional Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mapping behavior of the Marchaud fractional derivative with different extensions in the scale of fractional weighted Sobolev spaces. In particular we show that the $\alpha$--order Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative maps $W^{p,s}_0(\Omega)$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\Omega)$, for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and the $\alpha$--order Marchaud fractional derivative with even extension maps the fractional Sobolev space $W^{p,s}((0,\infty))$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\real)$ for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and $ps\geq1$ . The proof is based on the Calder\'{o}n--Lions interpolation theorem.</description>

      <title>Berndt-type Integrals: Unveiling Connections with Barnes Zeta and Jacobi Elliptic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a class of definite integrals known as Berndt-type integrals, highlighting their role as specialized instances within the integral representation framework of the Barnes-zeta function. Building upon the foundational insights of Xu and Zhao, who adeptly evaluate these integrals using rational linear combinations of Lambert-type series and derive closed-form expressions involving products of $\Gamma^4(1/4)$ and $\pi^{-1}$, we uncover direct evaluations of the Barnes-zeta function. Moreover, our inquiry leads us to establish connections between Berndt-type integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, as well as moment polynomials investigated by Lomont and Brillhart, a relationship elucidated through the seminal contributions of Kuznetsov. In this manner, we extend and integrate these diverse mathematical threads, unveiling deeper insights into the intrinsic connections and broader implications of Berndt-type integrals in special function and integration theory.</description>

      <title>Chevron patterns in an active nematic liquid crystal film in contact with Smectic A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new mechanism of active matter confinement of a thin, active nematic sample consisting of microtubules, activated by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), placed between a slab of passive liquid crystal, the compound 8CB, and water. The 8CB slab is kept at a temperature below the phase transition value between the nematic and the smectic A phases. The smectic A molecules are horizontally aligned with an applied magnetic field, with their centers of mass arranged on equally spaced layers perpendicular to the field. The contact with the active nematic prompts flow in the smectic slab, along the direction parallel to the layers. This flow direction is transferred back to the active nematic. We set up a model of such contact flow and make predictions on the experimentally observed pattern, from the point of view of asymptotic, linear and nonlinear analyses. We examine such results within the scope of the principle of minimum energy dissipation of the flow. For analytic convenience, we consider the active nematic confined between two symmetric 8CB slabs, and show that the conclusions still hold when replacing the bottom smectic A substrate with water, as in the experimental setting.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for quasi-periodic functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show Strichartz estimates for quasi-periodic functions with decaying Fourier coefficients via $\ell^2$-decoupling. When we additionally average in time, further improvements can be obtained. Next, we apply multilinear refinements to show low regularity local well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. For the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation the approach yields the sharp local well-posedness result.</description>

      <title>The space of Hardy-weights for quasilinear operators on discrete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for $p$-Schr\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs. Specifically, we prove a Maz'ya-type result, where we characterize the space of Hardy weights for $ p $-Schr\"odinger operators via a generalized capacity. The novel ingredient in the proof is the demonstration that the simplified energy of the $ p $-Schr\"odinger energy functional is compatible with certain normal contractions. As a consequence, we obtain a necessary integrability criterion for Hardy weights. Finally, using some tools of criticality theory, we investigate the existence of minimizers in the Hardy inequalities and discuss relations to Cheeger type estimates.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic selection of integral curves of a rough vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields $\bb$ in $L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d))$, there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of $\bb$. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in \cite{Depauw}, which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>

      <title>The Strong Matrix Weighted Maximal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove that the strong Christ-Goldberg maximal function is bounded. This is a matrix weighted maximal operator appearing in the theory of matrix weighted norm inequalities. Related to this we record the Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem with bi-parameter matrix weights.</description>

      <title>Generalized hypergeometric functions with several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hypergoemetirc series with two complex variables, which generalizes Appell's, Lauricella's and Kemp\'e de F\'eriet's hypergeometric series, and study the system of differential equations that it satisfies. We determine the singularities, the rank and the condition for the reducibility of the system. We give complete local solutions of the system at many singular points of the system and solve the connection problem among these local solutions. Under some assumptions, the system is written as a KZ equation. We determine its spectral type in the direction of coordinates as well as simultaneous eigenspace decompositions of residue matrices. The system may or may not be rigid in the sense of N.~Katz viewed as an ordinary differential equation in some direction. We also show that the system is a special case of Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky system. From this point of view, we discuss multivariate generalizations.</description>

      <title>Splitting Hypergeometric Functions over Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine hypergeometric functions in the finite field, p-adic and classical settings. In each setting, we prove a formula which splits the hypergeometric function into a sum of lower order functions whose arguments differ by roots of unity. We provide multiple applications of these results, including new reduction and summation formulas for finite field hypergeometric functions, along with classical analogues; evaluations of special values of these functions which apply in both the finite field and p-adic settings; and new relations to Fourier coefficients of modular forms.</description>
