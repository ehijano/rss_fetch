      <title>Discovering Motifs to Fingerprint Multi-Layer Networks: a Case Study on the Connectome of C. Elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motif discovery is a powerful approach to understanding network structures and their function. We present a comprehensive analysis of regulatory motifs in the connectome of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Leveraging the Efficient Subgraph Counting Algorithmic PackagE (ESCAPE) algorithm, we identify network motifs in the multi-layer nervous system of C. elegans and link them to functional circuits. We further investigate motif enrichment within signal pathways and benchmark our findings with random networks of similar size and link density. Our findings provide valuable insights into the organization of the nerve net of this well documented organism and can be easily transferred to other species and disciplines alike.</description>

      <title>Intracellular order formation through stepwise phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living cells inherently exhibit the ability to spontaneously reorganize their structures in response to changes in both their internal and external environments. Among these responses, the organization of stress fibers composed of actin molecules changes in direct accordance with the mechanical stiffness of their environments. On soft substrates, SFs are rarely formed, but as stiffness increases, they emerge with random orientation, progressively align, and eventually form thicker bundles as stiffness surpasses successive thresholds. These transformations share similarities with phase transitions studied in condensed matter physics, yet despite extensive research on cellular dynamics, the introduction of the statistical mechanics perspective to the environmental dependence of intracellular structures remains underexplored. With this physical framework, we identify key relationships governing these intracellular transitions, highlighting the delicate balance between energy and entropy. Our analysis provides a unified understanding of the stepwise phase transitions of actin structures, offering new insights into related biological mechanisms. Notably, our study suggests the existence of mechanical checkpoints in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which sequentially regulate the formation of intracellular structures to ensure proper cell cycle progression.</description>

      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through in-depth thinking and reasoning about the conditions required for cells to maintain unchanged material distribution, it is concluded that life metabolic reactions require high information content. However, the self-replication of a few macromolecules such as RNA and DNA can only retain information, but cannot generate information. When thinking about the possible ways in which this information is generated, one possible way is to maintain the distribution of substances in the cell through selective permeability and active transport of membranes. This mechanism still plays an important role in today's cells but it is difficult to generate enough information. Another possible way is to generate information through stability-distillation, which continuously changes the molecular frequency distribution in the system through periodic changes in the environment and generates information from a consequentialist perspective. Unlike the RNA world hypothesis, under this hypothesis, life does not need to originate from a few self-replicating macromolecules, making the entire hypothesis more reasonable.</description>
