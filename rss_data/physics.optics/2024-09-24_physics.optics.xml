      <title>High-Speed Multifunctional Photonic Memory on a Foundry-Processed Photonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of computing with memory is essential for distributed, massively parallel, and adaptive architectures such as neural networks in artificial intelligence (AI). Accelerating AI can be achieved through photonic computing, but it requires nonvolatile photonic memory capable of rapid updates during on-chip training sessions or when new information becomes available during deployment. Phase-change materials (PCMs) are promising for providing compact, nonvolatile optical weighting; however, they face limitations in terms of bit precision, programming speed, and cycling endurance. Here, we propose a novel photonic memory cell that merges nonvolatile photonic weighting using PCMs with high-speed, volatile tuning enabled by an integrated PN junction. Our experiments demonstrate that the same PN modulator, fabricated via a foundry compatible process, can achieve dual functionality. It supports coarse programmability for setting initial optical weights and facilitates high-speed fine-tuning to adjust these weights dynamically. The result showcases a 400-fold increase in volatile tuning speed and a 10,000-fold enhancement in efficiency. This multifunctional photonic memory with volatile and nonvolatile capabilities could significantly advance the performance and versatility of photonic memory cells, providing robust solutions for dynamic computing environments.</description>

      <title>Vortex Interference Enables optimal 3D Interferometric Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging methods that combine interferometric (z) analysis with single-molecule localization microscopy (iSMLM) have achieved ultra-high 3D precision and contributed to the elucidation of important biological ultrastructures. However, their dependence on imaging multiple phase-shifted output channels necessitates complex instrumentation and operation. To solve this problem, we develop an interferometric super-resolution microscope capable of optimal direct axial nanoscopy, termed VILM (Vortex Interference Localization Microscopy). Using a pair of vortex phase plates with opposite orientation for each dual-opposed objective lenses, the detection point-spread functions (PSFs) adopt a bilobed profile whose rotation encodes the axial position. Thus, direct 3D single-molecule coordinate determination can be achieved with a single output image. By reducing the number of output channels to as few as one and utilizing a simple 50:50 beamsplitter, the imaging system is significantly streamlined, while the optimal iSMLM imaging performance is retained, with axial resolution ~2 times better than the lateral. The capability of VILM is demonstrated by resolving the architecture of microtubules and probing the organization of tyrosine-phosphorylated signalling proteins in integrin-based cell adhesions.</description>

      <title>Mechanical losses and stability performance of NEXCERA in ultra-stable laser cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NEXCERA has been recently introduced as novel ceramic-based material for spacers of ultra-stable laser cavities with a zero-crossing coefficient of thermal expansion at room temperature. Brownian thermal noise currently limits the performance of these cavities, and the mechanical loss factor, a critical parameter in estimating this noise, remains unknown for NEXCERA. In this work, we investigate the mechanical loss factor of NEXCERA N117B at room temperature across different resonance frequencies using the Gentle Nodal Suspension technique. We measure a promising loss factor of $\phi = 1.89\times 10^{-5}$, indicating NEXCERA's potential for ultra-stable laser cavities. Based on these results, we calculate the thermal noise when NEXCERA is used as a spacer and compare its overall performance as a spacer material to widely used materials such as ULE and Zerodur, considering various substrate materials. Our findings suggest that NEXCERA is a strong candidate due to its lower thermal noise and reduced linear drift rate.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent mechanical losses of Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ for spectral hole burning laser stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical loss characteristics of Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$$\unicode{x2013}$a promising candidate for ultra-low-noise frequency stabilization through the spectral hole burning technique. Three different mechanical oscillators with varying surface-to-volume ratios and crystal orientations are evaluated. In this context, we perform mechanical ringdown and spectral measurements spanning temperatures from room temperature down to $15\,\mathrm{K}$. By doing so, we measure a maximum mechanical quality factor of $Q=3676$, corresponding to a loss angle of $\phi=2.72\times 10^{-4}$. For a spectral hole burning laser stabilization experiment at $300\,\mathrm{mK}$, we can estimate the Allan deviation of the fractional frequency instability due to Brownian thermal noise to be below $\sigma_{\delta \nu/\nu_0} = 2.5\times 10^{-18}$, a value lower than the estimated thermal-noise limit of any current cavity-referenced ultra-stable laser experiment.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal frequency conversion in a multimode nonlinear system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has become the workhorse for countless applications in classical and quantum optics, from optical bistability to single photon pair generation. However, the intrinsic weakness of optical nonlinearity has meant that large input powers and weak output powers are often a necessity in nonlinear frequency conversion. Here, motivated by recent advances in using non-Hermitian photonics and gain/loss engineering to enable non-reciprocal light transport, we explore how the interplay between non-Hermiticity and optical nonlinearity leads to a fundamentally new regime of nonlinear frequency conversion. We show how non-Hermitian coupling between discrete frequency modes can result in non-reciprocal flow of energy in the frequency dimension, closely resembling the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Applying our theory to a multimode nonlinear cavity supporting cascaded nonlinear processes, we create an asymmetric infrared (IR) comb that features a ``skin'' frequency mode populated with efficiency exceeding 85\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how three-wave mixing processes in the non-reciprocal infrared comb we generate enables terahertz (THz) generation exceeding the Manley-Rowe limit. We then show how the non-reciprocal frequency conversion is robust against cavity defects and disorder that cause random fluctuations in the dissipation rate for different modes. Moreover, in certain regimes, the nonlinear, non-Hermitian system supports stable limit cycles that can enable multimode pulsing with picosecond pulse widths and GHz repetition rates. Finally, we explore how the system can be applied to generate simultaneous IR and THz frequency combs, potentially unlocking novel applications in spectroscopy and metrology.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Thin, Ultra-Light, Rainbow-Free AR Glasses Based on Single-Layer Full-Color SiC Diffrcative Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information interaction technology advances, the efficiency, dimensionality, and user experience of information transmission have significantly improved. Communication has evolved from letters to telegraphs, markedly increasing transmission speed; from telephones to video calls, enhancing communication dimensions; and from smartphones to augmented reality (AR) displays, which provide increasingly immersive user experiences. Surface relief grating (SRG) diffractive waveguides have attracted considerable attention for their optimal balance between weight, size, optical performance, and mass production capabilities, positioning them as a leading solution for AR displays. However, as consumer expectations for higher display quality and better device integration rise, traditional high-refractive-index glass-based diffractive waveguides face limitations, including bulkiness, heavy weight, and conspicuous rainbow artifacts in full-color displays. To overcome these challenges, a novel solution: ultra-thin, lightweight silicon carbide (SiC) AR prescription glasses was proposed. This solution achieves full-color displays without rainbow artifacts, with total weight of just 2.685 g and thickness of only 0.55 mm. Moreover, these glasses are compatible with prescription Fresnel lenses and are well-suited for scalable mass production. This innovation provides a robust platform for the seamless integration of augmented reality into daily life, offering significant potential to enhance user interaction.</description>

      <title>Functional control of anomalous reflection via engineered metagratings without polarization limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metagratings (MGs) have emerged as a promising platform for manipulating the anomalous propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, traditional methods for designing functional MG-based devices face significant challenges, including complex model structures, time-consuming optimization processes, and specific polarization requirements. In this work, we propose an inverse-design approach to engineer simple MG structures comprising periodic air grooves on a flat metal surface, which can control anomalous reflection without polarization limitations. Through rigorous analytical methods, we derive solutions that achieve perfect retroreflection and perfect specular reflection, thereby leading to functional control over the linearly-polarized electromagnetic waves. Such capabilities enable intriguing functionalities including polarization-dependent retroreflection and polarization-independent retroreflection, as confirmed through full-wave simulations. Our work offers a simple and effective method to control freely electromagnetic waves, with potential applications spanning wavefront engineering, polarization splitting, cloaking technologies, and remote sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We posit that inconsistent interpretations of experimental data have led to inaccurate claims on metalens focusing efficiencies. By performing a meta-analysis,we show that extraordinary claims of high focusing efficiency at high numerical apertures are, unfortunately, not yet backed by rigorous simulation or experimental results. In this document, we have included the original comment and supplement, as well as the revised versions that correct the errors found in the original.</description>

      <title>Active control of excitonic strong coupling and electroluminescence in electrically driven plasmonic nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement and active control of light-matter interactions at the atomic scale is important for developing next-generation nanophotonic and quantum optical devices. Here, we demonstrate electric control of both excitonic strong coupling and electroluminescence by integrating semiconductor monolayers into a nanometer gap of electrically driven nanocube-on-mirror plasmonic nanocavities. Particularly, in a strongly-coupled system of nanocavity plasmons and WSe2 excitons, the ultra-strong electric field generated in the nanocavity gap enables a reversible modulation of the Rabi splitting between ~102 and 80 meV with a bias below 2.5 V. In the quantum tunnelling regime, by injecting carriers into a nanocavity-integrated WS2 monolayer, bias-controlled spectrally tunable electroluminescence from charged or neutral excitons is achieved with an external quantum efficiency reaching ~3.5%. These results underline practical approaches to electric control of atomic-scale light-matter interactions for applications including nanoscale light sources, ultrafast electro-optic modulation, quantum information processing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid iterating-averaging low photon budget Gabor holographic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in live cell culture observation is achieving high-contrast imaging with minimal impact on sample behavior. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) techniques address this by providing label-free, high-contrast images of transparent samples. Measurement system influence may be further reduced by imaging samples under low illumination intensity (low photon budget - LPB), thereby minimizing photostimulation, phototoxicity, and photodamage, and enabling high-speed imaging. LPB imaging is challenging in QPI due to significant camera shot noise and quantification noise. Digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM), working with or without lenses, is a QPI technique known for its robustness to quantification noise. However, reducing simultaneously the camera shot noise and the inherent in-line holographic twin image disturbances remain a critical, yet unaddressed, challenge. This study introduces an innovative iterative Gabor averaging (IGA) algorithm designed specifically for filling this important scientific gap in multi-frame DIHM under LPB conditions. We evaluated the performance of the IGA on simulated data showing that it outperformed traditional algorithms in terms of reconstruction accuracy under high noise conditions. Those results were corroborated by experimental validation involving high-speed imaging of dynamic sperm cells and a phase test target under significantly reduced illumination power. Additionally, the IGA algorithm proved successful in reconstructing optically thin samples, which typically produce low signal-to-noise ratio holograms even under high photon budget conditions. These advancements facilitate photostimulation-free and high-speed imaging of dynamic biological samples and enhance the capability to image samples with extremely low optical thickness, potentially transforming various applications in biomedical and environmental imaging.</description>

      <title>Anti-resonant reflecting acoustic rib waveguides for strong opto-acoustic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few known material systems can simultaneously guide optical and elastic fields through total internal reflection. This natural limit has restricted the realization of strong optoacoustic effects to highly-specialised and purpose-built platforms which employ either exotic materials, or complex waveguide designs. Here we apply the concept of Anti-Resonant Reflecting Acoustic Waveguides (ARRAWs) as a potential solution to this issue. ARRAWs confine the elastic field to a high-elastic-velocity core via the anti-resonances of a cladding layer of lower elastic velocity. We numerically study the appearance and dispersion of ARRAW-guided modes in a conventional silicon-on-insulator rib waveguide geometry. Applying the technique to the problem of efficient backwards Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), we predict that ARRAW guidance, in conjunction with conventional optical confinement, can produce Brillouin gains comparable to those of more exotic geometries.</description>

      <title>Giant and Flexible Toroidal Circular Dichroism from Planar Chiral Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, a fundamental concept describing an object cannot superpose with its mirror image, is crucial in optics and photonics and leads to various exotic phenomena, such as circular dichroism, and optical activity. Recent findings reveal that, besides electric and magnetic dipoles, toroidal dipoles, an elusive part of dynamic multipoles, can also contribute significantly to chirality. However, as toroidal dipoles are typically represented by solenoidal currents circulating on a three-dimensional (3D) torus, toroidal circular dichroism is usually observed in 3D intricate microstructures. Facing corresponding challenges in fabrication, integration and application, it is generally difficult to employ toroidal circular dichroism in compact metasurfaces for flexible modulation of chiral interactions between electromagnetic waves and matter. To overcome these stringent challenges, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the giant toroidal circular dichroism in a bilayer metasurface that is comprised of only planar layers, effectively bypassing various restrictions imposed by 3D microstructures. With the introduction of a displacement, or bilayer offset, between the opposite layers, we experimentally achieve giant chiral responses with the intrinsic circular dichroism (CD) reaching 0.69 in measurements, and the CD can be quantitatively manipulated in a simple manner. The giant intrinsic chirality primarily originates from distinct excitations of in-plane toroidal dipole moments under circular polarized incidences, and the toroidal chiral response is quantitatively controlled by the bilayer offset. Therefore, our work provides a straightforward and versatile approach for development of giant and flexible intrinsic chirality through toroidal dipoles with inherently planar layers, important for applications in communications, sensing, and chiroptical devices.</description>

      <title>Extending completeness of the eigenmodes of an open system beyond its boundary, for Green's function and scattering-matrix calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic completeness of a set of the eigenmodes of an open system with increasing number of modes enables an accurate calculation of the system response in terms of these modes. Using the exact eigenmodes, such completeness is limited to the interior of the system. Here we show that when the eigenmodes of a target system are obtained by the resonant-state expansion, using the modes of a basis system embedding the target system, the completeness extends beyond the boundary of the target system. We illustrate this by using the Mittag-Leffler series of the Green's function expressed in terms of the eigenmodes, which converges to the correct solution anywhere within the basis system, including the space outside the target system. Importantly, this property allows one to treat pertubations outside the target system and to calculate the scattering cross-section using the boundary conditions for the basis system. Choosing a basis system of spherical geometry, these boundary conditions have simple analytical expressions, allowing for an efficient calculation of the response of the target system, as we demonstrate for a resonator in a form of a finite dielectric cylinder.</description>

Abstract: Reflection-type terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) enables the measurement of optical properties of opaque samples in the THz frequency range, e.g., carrier density and mobility. In this study, we examine the influence of phase inaccuracy on the extracted complex refractive index from reflection-type THz-TDS. Phase inaccuracy often arises from the placement mismatch between the perfect reflector, serving as the reference, and the target samples in reflection-type THz-TDS. By considering two representative systems, where free and bound carriers dominate optical properties, and introducing arbitrarily shifted placement mismatch, we confirm that significant errors in the extracted complex refractive index occur when the mismatch position exceeds 3 {\mu}m.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on broadband generation based on noise-like pulse (NLP) fiber lasers at 1.55 {\mu}m and 1.06 {\mu}m, respectively. The 1.55 {\mu}m laser system can generate a broadband spectrum with a 20 dB bandwidth of up to 205 nm, while the 1.06 {\mu}m one can achieve a 20 dB bandwidth of 341 nm after amplification and spectral broadening. Simulation results reproduce experimental details and highlight the role of nonlinear effects in achieving broad spectral outputs, underscoring the suitability of NLPs for advanced applications.</description>

Abstract: In this short Topical Review, we look at something typically considered trivial, but not given formally elsewhere -- the behaviour of first multiple fermions then multiple bosons at a beamsplitter, and, extending from this, the behaviour of multiple fermions and multiple bosons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). We hope that by showing how to go from mathematically-simple but unintuitive quantum field theory to a phenomenological description, this Review will help researchers and students in the field build a stronger intuition for the behaviour of quantum particles.</description>

      <title>Robust Single-Photon Generation for Quantum Information Enabled by Stimulated Adiabatic Rapid Passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of single photons using solid-state quantum emitters is pivotal for advancing photonic quantum technologies, particularly in quantum communication. As the field continuously advances towards practical use cases and beyond shielded laboratory environments, specific demands are placed on the robustness of quantum light sources during operation. In this context, the robustness of the quantum light generation process against intrinsic and extrinsic effects is a major challenge. Here, we present a robust scheme for the coherent generation of indistinguishable single-photon states with very low photon number coherence (PNC) using a three-level system in a semiconductor quantum dot. Our novel approach combines the advantages of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) and stimulated two-photon excitation (sTPE). We demonstrate robust quantum light generation while maintaining the prime quantum-optical quality of the emitted light state. Moreover, we highlight the immediate advantages for the implementation of various quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Near-field-assisted capacity of spoof-plasmonic channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing universal features of spoof-plasmonic systems beyond spectral properties is challenging due to the complexity of the specific physical realizations of spoof-plasmonic channels. We introduce a simple 1D scalar model reproducing the key properties of spoof-plasmonic channels and investigate manifestations of plasmonic-like features when only a few local resonances are present. We show that the channel between the source applied to the interior of the structure and the terminal ends (output ports) effectively comprises two subchannels. The activation of one of the subchannels depends on the spatial variation of the source, and therefore, the contribution of this subchannel in conventional systems is small if the source occupies a subwavelength region. We show that, in spoof-plasmonic structures, the activation of this subchannel can enhance significantly in the frequency region where the spoof-plasmonic effects are prominent. This demonstrates that even a few local scattering resonances may strongly impact the flow of wave-carried information.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scattering-channel-based Approach for Multiuser Image Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional scattering-based encryption systems that operate based on a static complex medium which is used by all users are vulnerable to learning-based attacks that exploit ciphertext-plaintext pairs to model and reverse-engineer the scattering medium's response, enabling unauthorized decryption without the physical medium. In this contribution, a new dynamic scattering-channel-based technique for multiuser image encryption is developed. The established approach employs variable, dynamic scattering media which are modeled as tunable aggregates of multiple scattering nanoparticles. The proposed system supports multiple users by allowing distinct combinations of scattering matrices for different time blocks, each combined with user-specific complex-valued coefficients, enabling the creation of unique, hard-to-guess encryption keys for each user. The derived methodology enhances the practical feasibility of multiuser secure communication and storage channels employing scattering media as the encryption mechanism.</description>

      <title>Scattering of TE and TM waves and quantum dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a linear isotropic medium with planar symmetry can be reduced to that of their TE and TM modes. For situations where the medium consists of parallel homogeneous slabs, one may use the standard transfer matrix technique to address the scattering problem for these modes. We extend the utility of this technique to inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability profiles by proposing a dynamical formulation of the scattering of TE and TM waves in which the transfer matrix for the medium is given in terms of the evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. This leads to a system of dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Decoupling these equations we reduce the solution of the scattering problem for TE and TM modes to that of an initial-value problem for a Riccati equation. We discuss the application of this observation in identifying media that do not reflect TE or TM waves with given wavenumber and incidence angle.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Control of Linear and Nonlinear Magno-Phononics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of magnetism through the lattice provides unprecedented opportunities for controlling spintronic functionalities on the ultrafast timescale. Such nonthermal control conventionally involves nonlinear excitation of Raman-active phonons which are coupled to the magnetic order. Linear excitation, in contrast, holds potential for more efficient and selective modulation of magnetic properties. However, the linear channel remains uncharted, since it is conventionally considered forbidden in inversion symmetric quantum materials. Here, we harness strong coupling between magnons and Raman-active phonons to achieve both linear and quadratic excitation regimes of magnon-polarons, magnon-phonon hybrid quasiparticles. We demonstrate this by driving magnon-polarons with an intense terahertz pulse in the van der Waals antiferromagnet $\mathrm{FePS_3}$. Such excitation behavior enables a unique way to coherently control the amplitude of magnon-polaron oscillations by tuning the terahertz field strength and its polarization. The polarimetry of the resulting coherent oscillation amplitude breaks the crystallographic $C_2$ symmetry due to strong interference between different excitation channels. Our findings unlock a wide range of possibilities to manipulate material properties, including modulation of exchange interactions by phonon-Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation instabilities via internal resonance in a multimode membrane as a mechanism for frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore self-induced parametric coupling, also called internal resonances (IRs), in a membrane nanoelectromechanical system. Specifically, we focus on the formation of a limit cycle manifesting as a phononic frequency comb. Utilizing a pump-noisy-probe technique and theoretical modeling, we reveal the behavior of mechanical excitations revealing themselves as sidebands of the stationary IR response. We find that when the energy-absorbing excitation of a lower mode is parametrically-upconverted to hybridize with a higher mode, significant squeezing and bimodality in the upper mode occurs. Instead, when the upconverted absorbing excitation hybridizes with an emitting sideband of the higher mode, a Hopf bifurcation occurs and a limit cycle forms, manifesting as a frequency comb. We thus reveal a unique mechanism to obtain frequency combs in parametrically-coupled modes. We furthermore demonstrate a rich variety of IR effects, the origin of which significantly extends beyond standard linear parametric coupling phenomena. Our findings enhance the understanding of energy transfer mechanisms with implications for advanced sensing technologies and novel phononic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Helical dichroism for hybridized quadrupole plasmon modes in twisted nanorods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD), originating from the interplay between chiral plasmonic structures and left and right vortex light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted significant attention across various disciplines owing to its implications in fundamental physics and applications. However, the precise relationship between HD and the excited plasmon modes remains elusive. Owing to the weak chiroptical response to OAM light, chiral structures have required dimensions larger than the incident light wavelength to obtain observable HD signals, resulting in complex superpositions of higher-order plasmon modes. In this letter, we reveal that a simple twisted nanorod dimer with a size smaller than the incident light wavelength, exhibits remarkable HD due to the strong coupling between quadrupole plasmon modes excited in the nanorods, followed by the plasmon hybridization. Positive and negative HD responses were measured at different resonance wavelengths corresponding to two hybridized quadrupole modes, in good agreement with the calculated results. This spectral behavior of the HD is clearly different from that of the circular dichroism (CD) based on spin angular momentum (SAM) of light, indicating that the quadrupole HD arises from the OAM rather than the SAM. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of light-matter interactions concerning angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: Improving phosphor photoluminescence efficiency is a key parameter to boost the performances of many optical devices. In this work, colloidal silver nanocubes, homogeneously spread on a luminescent surface, have proved to help both injecting and extracting light in and out of the photoluminescent layer and hence contributed significantly to the enhancement of the fluorescence. This approach has been applied to two materials: the well-known Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$:Ce yellow phosphor and an optical quartz. The emission efficiency, for sol-gel derived YAG:Ce layers, has increased of 80\% in the presence of an optimal nanoparticle density -- whereas for quartz, a weakly fluorescent material, the photoluminescence signal can be enhanced by a 200-fold factor. A physical analysis based on simulations shows that the disorder is an important factor and that the surface density of Ag nanoparticles is a crucial parameter.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses, such as wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation under external stimuli, can exhibit varying properties or functionalities under different conditions. Herein, we aim at rapid inverse design of these metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors. This inverse problem is challenging due to its intractability and the existence of non-unique solutions. Past works mainly focus on deep-learning-based methods that are data-demanding, require time-consuming training and hyperparameter tuning, and are non-interpretable. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), an iteration-free, single-shot inverse design method to achieve the fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. Unlike most existing methods, by exploiting the interpretability of the random forest, we eliminate the need to train an inverse model mapping responses to designs. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained forward model, one can sample design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The RIGID method therefore functions as a generative model that captures the conditional distribution of satisfying solutions given a design target. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RIGID on both acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems where only small datasets (less than 250 training samples) are available. Synthetic design problems are created to further illustrate and validate the mechanism of likelihood estimation in RIGID. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design and eliminating its large data requirement.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$~nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100~$\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 4.8~kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing electric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action potential.</description>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) as high as 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>

Abstract: Controlling quantum materials with light is of fundamental and technological importance. By utilizing the strong coupling of light and matter in optical cavities (1-3), recent studies were able to modify some of their most defining features (4-6). In this work, we study the magneto-optical properties of a van der Waals magnet that supports strong coupling of photons and excitons even in the absence of external cavity mirrors. In this material - the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr - emergent light-matter hybrids called polaritons are shown to significantly increase the spectral bandwidth of correlations between the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties, enabling largely tunable optical responses to applied magnetic fields and magnons. Our results highlight the importance of exciton-photon self-hybridization in van der Waals magnets and motivate novel directions for the manipulation of quantum material properties by strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-mobility edges in quasiperiodic mosaic lattices</title>

Abstract: The mobility edge (ME) is a crucial concept in understanding localization physics, marking the critical transition between extended and localized states in the energy spectrum. Anderson localization scaling theory predicts the absence of ME in lower dimensional systems. Hence, the search for exact MEs, particularly for single particles in lower dimensions, has recently garnered significant interest in both theoretical and experimental studies, resulting in notable progress. However, several open questions remain, including the possibility of a single system exhibiting multiple MEs and the continual existence of extended states, even within the strong disorder domain. Here, we provide experimental evidence to address these questions by utilizing a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice with meticulously designed nanophotonic circuits. Our observations demonstrate the coexistence of both extended and localized states in lattices with broken duality symmetry and varying modulation periods. By single site injection and scanning the disorder level, we could approximately probe the ME of the modulated lattice. These results corroborate recent theoretical predictions, introduce a new avenue for investigating ME physics, and offer inspiration for further exploration of ME physics in the quantum regime using hybrid integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum computer-enabled receivers for optical communication</title>

Abstract: Optical communication is the standard for high-bandwidth information transfer in today's digital age. The increasing demand for bandwidth has led to the maturation of coherent transceivers that use phase- and amplitude-modulated optical signals to encode more bits of information per transmitted pulse. Such encoding schemes achieve higher information density, but also require more complicated receivers to discriminate the signaling states. In fact, achieving the ultimate limit of optical communication capacity, especially in the low light regime, requires coherent joint detection of multiple pulses. Despite their superiority, such joint detection receivers are not in widespread use because of the difficulty of constructing them in the optical domain. In this work we describe how optomechanical transduction of phase information from coherent optical pulses to superconducting qubit states followed by the execution of trained short-depth variational quantum circuits can perform joint detection of communication codewords with error probabilities that surpass all classical, individual pulse detection receivers. Importantly, we utilize a model of optomechanical transduction that captures non-idealities such as thermal noise and loss in order to understand the transduction performance necessary to achieve a quantum advantage with such a scheme. We also execute the trained variational circuits on an IBM-Q device with the modeled transduced states as input to demonstrate that a quantum advantage is possible even with current levels of quantum computing hardware noise.</description>

      <title>An All-Optical General-Purpose CPU and Optical Computer Architecture</title>

Abstract: Energy efficiency of electronic digital processors is primarily limited by the energy consumption of electronic communication and interconnects. The industry is almost unanimously pushing towards replacing both long-haul, as well as local chip interconnects, using optics to drastically increase efficiency. In this paper, we explore what comes after the successful migration to optical interconnects, as with this inefficiency solved, the main source of energy consumption will be electronic digital computing, memory and electro-optical conversion. Our approach attempts to address all these issues by introducing efficient all-optical digital computing and memory, which in turn eliminates the need for electro-optical conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a scheme to enable general purpose digital data processing in an integrated form and present our photonic integrated circuit (PIC) implementation. For this demonstration we implemented a URISC architecture capable of running any classical piece of software all-optically and present a comprehensive architectural framework for all-optical computing to go beyond.</description>

      <title>Rydberg EIT based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. The linewidth of the laser lock is ~0.8 MHz and ~1.8 MHz in the presence and in the absence of the external magnetic field, respectively. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtual surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>
