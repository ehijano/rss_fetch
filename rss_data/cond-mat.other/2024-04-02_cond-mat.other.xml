      <title>The Exotic Quasisolidity and Supersolidity of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water is ubiquitously important but least known. This perspective features the latest finding of two exotic forms of water called quasisolid and supersolid phases due to the cooperativity and disparity of the O:H-O bond in its segmental length, energy, and specific heat when subjected to thermal, electric, and undercoordination perturbation. The quasisolid (QS) phase only appears at temperatures between melting and ice nucleation, regardless of sample size, and this phase has a negative thermal expansivity (NTE). However, polarization or molecular undercoordination creates the supersolid phase in skins of water and ice, droplets, ionic hydration cells, and volumetric water with a current flow or under a 106 eV/cm electric bias. This phase is characterized by ~10% H-O bond contraction and vibrating at ~3450 cm-1. The supersolid has unique properties such as high elasticity, mechanical strength, optical reflectivity, structure order, thermal stability, diffusivity, catalytic activity, and chemical reactivity. Liquid-QS-Ice transition with QS phase energy absorption occurs for water due to H-O bond contraction during thermal decay but not for the supersolid phase of saturated NaCl solution. The NTE of the QS fosters ice buoyancy and the supersolidity endows ice slipperiness, supercooling, superheating, premelting, low-temperature fiber elasticity, water bridge, and warm water fast cooling, as well as on water chemistry.</description>

      <title>Giant and negative magnetoresistances in conical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetotransport in conical helimagnet crystals. Spin dependent magnetoresistance exhibits dramatic properties for high and low electron concentrations at different temperatures. For spin up electrons we find negative magnetoresistance despite only considering a single carrier type. For spin down electrons we observe giant magnetoresistance due to depletion of spin down electrons with an applied magnetic field. For spin up carriers, the magnetoresistance is negative, due to the increase in charge carriers with a magnetic field. In addition, we investigate spin dependent Hall effect. If a magnetic field reaches some critical value for spin down electrons, giant Hall resistance occurs, i.e., Hall current vanishes. This effect is explained by the absence of spin down carriers. For spin up carriers, the Hall constant dramatically decreases with field, due to the increase in spin up electron density. Because of the giant spin dependent magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity, conical helimagnets could be useful in spin switching devices.</description>

      <title>Integrated ultrafast all-optical polariton transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clock speed of electronic circuits has been stagnant at a few gigahertz for almost two decades because of the breakdown of Dennard scaling, which states that by shrinking the size of transistors they can operate faster while maintaining the same power consumption. Optical computing could overcome this roadblock, but the lack of materials with suitably strong nonlinear interactions needed to realize all-optical switches has, so far, precluded the fabrication of scalable architectures. Recently, microcavities in the strong light-matter interaction regime enabled all-optical transistors which, when used with an embedded organic material, can operate even at room temperature with sub-picosecond switching times, down to the single-photon level. However, the vertical cavity geometry prevents complex circuits with on-chip coupled transistors. Here, by leveraging silicon photonics technology, we show exciton-polariton condensation at ambient conditions in micrometer-sized, fully integrated high-index contrast grating microcavities filled with an optically active polymer. By coupling two resonators and exploiting seeded polariton condensation, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical transistor action and cascadability. Our experimental findings open the way for scalable, compact all-optical integrated logic circuits that could process optical signals two orders of magnitude faster than their electrical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of thin parahydrogen films on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of one and two layers of parahydrogen adsorbed on graphite are investigated theoretically through Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We adopt a microscopic model that explicitly includes the corrugation of the substrate. We study the phase diagram of a monolayer up to second layer promotion, and the possible occurrence of superfluidity in the second layer. We obtain results down to a temperature as low as 8 mK. We find second-layer promotion to occur at a considerably greater coverage than obtained in previous calculations and estimated experimentally; moreover, we find no evidence of a possible finite superfluid response in the second layer, disproving recent theoretical predictions.</description>
