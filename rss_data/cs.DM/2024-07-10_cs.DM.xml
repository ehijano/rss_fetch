      <title>The Path-Label Reconciliation (PLR) Dissimilarity Measure for Gene Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of comparing gene trees reconciled with the same species tree using a novel semi-metric, called the Path-Label Reconciliation (PLR) dissimilarity measure. This approach not only quantifies differences in the topology of reconciled gene trees, but also considers discrepancies in predicted ancestral gene-species maps and speciation/duplication events, offering a refinement of existing metrics such as Robinson-Foulds (RF) and their labeled extensions LRF and ELRF. A tunable parameter {\alpha} also allows users to adjust the balance between its species map and event labeling components. We show that PLR can be computed in linear time and that it is a semi-metric. We also discuss the diameters of reconciled gene tree measures, which are important in practice for normalization, and provide initial bounds on PLR, LRF, and ELRF. To validate PLR, we simulate reconciliations and perform comparisons with LRF and ELRF. The results show that PLR provides a more evenly distributed range of distances, making it less susceptible to overestimating differences in the presence of small topological changes, while at the same time being computationally efficient. Our findings suggest that the theoretical diameter is rarely reached in practice. The PLR measure advances phylogenetic reconciliation by combining theoretical rigor with practical applicability. Future research will refine its mathematical properties, explore its performance on different tree types, and integrate it with existing bioinformatics tools for large-scale evolutionary analyses. The open source code is available at: https://pypi.org/project/parle/.</description>

      <title>Constructing $k$-ary Orientable Sequences with Asymptotically Optimal Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ over an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots, k{-}1\}$ is a cyclic sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. When $k= 2$, efficient algorithms are known to construct binary orientable sequences, with asymptotically optimal length, by applying the classic cycle-joining technique. The key to the construction is the definition of a parent rule to construct a cycle-joining tree of asymmetric bracelets. Unfortunately, the parent rule does not generalize to larger alphabets. Furthermore, unlike the binary case, a cycle-joining tree does not immediately lead to a simple successor-rule when $k \geq 3$ unless the tree has certain properties. In this paper, we derive a parent rule to derive a cycle-joining tree of $k$-ary asymmetric bracelets. This leads to a successor rule that constructs asymptotically optimal $k$-ary orientable sequences in $O(n)$ time per symbol using $O(n)$ space. In the special case when $n=2$, we provide a simple construction of $k$-ary orientable sequences of maximal length.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding maximizers of King's criterion, and finding the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we call King cones. We demonstrate that the King cones for rank-one representations can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, allowing us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability of rank-one representations in strongly polynomial time. Our argument employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Forcing quasirandomness with 4-point permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combinatorial object is said to be quasirandom if it exhibits certain properties that are typically seen in a truly random object of the same kind. It is known that a permutation is quasirandom if and only if the pattern density of each of the twenty-four 4-point permutations is close to 1/24, which is its expected value in a random permutation. In other words, the set of all twenty-four 4-point permutations is quasirandom-forcing. Moreover, it is known that there exist sets of eight 4-point permutations that are also quasirandom-forcing. Breaking the barrier of linear dependency of perturbation gradients, we show that every quasirandom-forcing set of 4-point permutations must have cardinality at least five.</description>

      <title>Compact formulations and valid inequalities for parallel machine scheduling with conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of scheduling conflicting jobs on parallel machines consists in assigning a set of jobs to a set of machines so that no two conflicting jobs are allocated to the same machine, and the maximum processing time among all machines is minimized. We propose a new compact mixed integer linear formulation based on the representatives model for the vertex coloring problem, which overcomes a number of issues inherent in the natural assignment model. We present a polyhedral study of the associated polytope, and describe classes of valid inequalities inherited from the stable set polytope. We describe branch-and-cut algorithms for the problem, and report on computational experiments with benchmark instances. Our computational results on the hardest instances of the benchmark set show that the proposed algorithms are superior (either in running time or quality of the solutions) to the current state-of-the-art methods. We find that our new method performs better than the existing ones especially when the gap between the optimal value and the trivial lower bound (i.e., the sum of all processing times divided by the number of machines) increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply automata theory and Karp's minimum mean weight cycle algorithm to minimum density problems in coding theory. Using this method, we find the new upper bound $53/126 \approx 0.4206$ for the minimum density of an identifying code on the infinite hexagonal grid, down from the previous record of $3/7 \approx 0.4286$.</description>

      <title>On The Maximum Linear Arrangement Problem for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear arrangements of graphs are a well-known type of graph labeling and are found in many important computational problems, such as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem ($\texttt{minLA}$). A linear arrangement is usually defined as a permutation of the $n$ vertices of a graph. An intuitive geometric setting is that of vertices lying on consecutive integer positions in the real line, starting at 1; edges are often drawn as semicircles above the real line. In this paper we study the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem ($\texttt{MaxLA}$), the maximization variant of $\texttt{minLA}$. We devise a new characterization of maximum arrangements of general graphs, and prove that $\texttt{MaxLA}$ can be solved for cycle graphs in constant time, and for $k$-linear trees ($k\le2$) in time $O(n)$. We present two constrained variants of $\texttt{MaxLA}$ we call $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ and $\texttt{1-thistle MaxLA}$. We prove that the former can be solved in time $O(n)$ for any bipartite graph; the latter, by an algorithm that typically runs in time $O(n^4)$ on unlabelled trees. The combination of the two variants has two promising characteristics. First, it solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for almost all trees consisting of a few tenths of nodes. Second, we prove that it constitutes a $3/2$-approximation algorithm for $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for trees. Furthermore, we conjecture that $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for at least $50\%$ of all free trees.</description>
