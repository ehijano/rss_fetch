      <title>A complex scalar field theory for charged fluids, superfluids, and fracton fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids formulated in terms of a complex scalar field defined on a spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. In the normal phase, the dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space.</description>

      <title>Gluon scattering amplitudes with instantons and minimal surfaces with topology change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10865v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instanton effect on the gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling and large $N$ for the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. According to Alday and Maldacena, the gluon scattering amplitude corresponds holographically to the area of a worldsheet minimal surface in the T-dual AdS${}_5$ geometry. The Yang-Mills instanton introduces an instanton D-brane in the geometry, with which a particular boundary condition for the minimal surface is imposed. We show that the minimal surface undergoes a topology change depending on the size and the gluon momenta, and that the instanton amplitude exhibits a characteristic dependence on gluon momenta. More specifically, we find that when the fixed instanton size modulus $\rho$ is larger than ${\cal O}(\sqrt{\lambda}/E)$ where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling and $E$ is the typical momentum of the scattering gluon, due to the topology change of the worldsheet minimal surface, the instanton amplitude is exponentially enhanced as $\exp(\rho E)$.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network solves minimal surfaces in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10866v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the classical gravitational entropy of a horizon as a Noether charge that does not require the notion of a temperature, and which is applicable to horizons that are not necessarily associated with black holes. This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field conjugate to the charge. The vector field is related to the proposal of Bousso that the gravitational entropy of a region is determined by the lightsheet at its boundary. We test the formula on various black hole and cosmological horizons.</description>

      <title>Inflationary trispectrum of gauge fields from scalar and tensor exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the inflationary trispectrum of primordial gauge fields generated through the scalar and tensor exchanges in models with spectator $U(1)$ gauge fields which are kinetically coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Wrapped D4-branes from maximal 6D gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a large class of domain wall solutions with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$ and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices from maximal gauged supergravity in six dimensions. $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$ are given by a Riemann surface and a $3$-manifold with constant curvature while $Mkw_{3,2}$ denotes three/two-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider the maximal gauged supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$ gauge groups arising from an $S^1$ reduction of seven-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)$ gauge groups. The two types of gauge group can be embedded in type IIA theory via consistent truncations on $H^{p,q}\times \mathbb{R}^{5-p-q}$ and $H^{p,q}\times\mathbb{R}^{4-p-q}\times S^1$, respectively. By performing topological twists on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$, we find a number of solutions interpolating between locally flat domain walls in the UV and curved domain walls with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$ and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices in the IR. Many solutions admit physical IR singularities and can be interpreted as holographic RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional field theories to three- and two-dimensional non-conformal field theories in the IR. Upon uplifted to type IIA theory, we expect the solutions to describe brane configurations involving D4-branes wrapped on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$.</description>

      <title>Quantum state spectrum and field theory of D$0$-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</description>

      <title>Dual is Different: EFTs, Axions and Nonpropagating Form Fields in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields in 4D are known to have equivalent dual descriptions in terms of form-field gauge potentials, but this is often regarded as an arcane fact. Why use more complicated formulations when simpler scalar descriptions exist and are equivalent? We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals can differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the interchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological information to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these we add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative interactions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that quantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving gravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit, the non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to be suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are nonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual formulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the universal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\mu \partial_\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\mu J_\mu$ contact interactions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we explore. We also emphasize the non-trivial role and cosmological implications of non-propagating 3-form gauge potentials and clarify confusing statements recently made in the literature regarding the validity of duality for massive form fields.</description>

      <title>On RN-AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings and Quintessence in Noncommuative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by certain recent works, we study thermodynamic and optical properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black holes in a noncommutative spacetime with a string cloud and quintessence dark fields. After analyzing the global and the local stabilities, we examine the criticality and the Joule-Thomson expansion behaviors in such noncommutative backgrounds. Concretely, we find that the critical universal numbers X_N can be expressed as X_0 + NX, where N is the quintessence parameter and X_0 is the critical universal number of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black holes in a NC spacetime without additional external fields. Furthermore, we find that Van der Waals behaviors can be recovered by strictly constraining the charge in terms of external parameters. To conclude this work, we compute and examine the deflection angle of lights in such a modified spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>QCD Effective Lagrangian and Condensation of Chromomagnetic Flux Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum polarisation effects induced by the sourceless solutions of the Yang-Mills equation are investigated. These solutions represent oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes permeating the space in all directions. We review and prove the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian on sourceless gauge fields and present a number of alternative methods allowing to compute the effective Lagrangian. We compute the effective Lagrangian on chromomagnetic flux tube solutions and demonstrate that the effective Lagrangian has a universal form that supports the stability of the chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum is a highly degenerate state. The stability is a result of the quartic nonlinear self-interaction of the negative mode completely eliminating the instability and the imaginary term from the effective Lagrangian in chromomagnetic field. It is suggested that the condensate of chromomagnetic flux tubes represents a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee vector-tensor dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. In this paper, we highlight several often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their cosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is essential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a ghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients, known as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a subset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By imposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at the background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in vacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive a de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are negligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections to the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the level of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark energy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective gravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static regime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from $\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the two models.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic Chern-Simons Matter Theories: Global Forms, Dualities, and Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic quiver framework is proposed for studying maximal branches of 3d orthosymplectic Chern-Simons matter theories with $\mathcal{N} \geq 3$ supersymmetry, arising from Type IIB brane setups with O3 planes. These branches are extracted via brane moves, yielding orthosymplectic $\mathcal{N}=4$ magnetic quivers whose Coulomb branches match the moduli spaces of interest. Global gauge group data, inaccessible from brane configurations alone, are determined through supersymmetric indices, Hilbert series, and fugacity maps. The analysis is exploratory in nature and highlights several subtle features. In particular, magnetic quivers are proposed as predictions for the maximal branches in a range of examples. Along the way, dualities and structural puzzles are uncovered, reminiscent of challenges in 3d mirror symmetry with orientifolds.</description>

      <title>More solutions to the decoration transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate new solutions to the decoration transformation in terms of various special functions, including the hyperbolic gamma function, the basic hypergeometric function, and the Euler gamma function. These solutions to the symmetry transformation are important to decorate Ising-like integrable lattice spin models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. The integral identities represented as the solution of the decoration transformation are derived from the three-dimensional partition functions and superconformal index for the dual supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Cosmological FLRW phase transitions under exponential corrected entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>On the K-point in moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of infinite-distance loci, referred to as K-points, in one-parameter complex-structure moduli spaces of type IIB string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that around K-points the effective four-dimensional supergravity exhibits certain unusual properties. The two most prominent being that the leading order dependence of the prepotential on the gauge couplings is non-perturbative and that the leading gauge kinetic terms in the action vanish when evaluated on an anti self-dual graviphoton background. These properties are shared with the conifold locus in moduli space, rather than the large complex-structure locus. The conifold locus is well-known to arise from integrating out a charged BPS state, and so the similarities suggest that the K-point also arises from integrating out a BPS state. We develop such an interpretation, finding that it corresponds to a BPS state which is extremely light, whose mass in Planck units is doubly-exponentially small in the distance to the K-point. The state behaves as if it had complex charges, or as if it couples to the self-dual and anti self-dual parts of the graviphoton differently. Assuming such an integrating-out scenario is indeed the correct physics for the K-point, we discuss the implications for our understanding of infinite distances in moduli space and for the Swampland Distance Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Method of regions for dual conformal integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the method of regions to the evaluation of dual conformal integrals with small off-shellness. In contrast to conventional approach, where the separation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization which breaks the dual conformal invariance (DCI) of separate contributions, we use the regularization which is sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and analytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization, the contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method dramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate a slightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The contributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of $\Gamma$-functions thus giving, after removing the regularization, the final expression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only. We have checked that our result for pentabox integral numerically agrees with the result of the recent Belitsky&amp;Smirnov paper [arXiv:2508.14298] which has essentially more complicated form.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects for Black Holes with On-Shell Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quiver superconformal index and giant gravitons: asymptotics and expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <title>QEDtool: a Python package for numerical quantum information in quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the manual of the first version of QEDtool, an object-oriented Python package that performs numerical quantum electrodynamics calculations, with focus on full state reconstruction in the internal degrees of freedom, correlations and entanglement quantification. Our package rests on the evaluation of polarized Feynman amplitudes in the momentum-helicity basis within a relativistic framework. Users can specify both pure and mixed initial scattering states in polarization space. From the specified initial state and polarized Feynman amplitudes, QEDtool reconstructs correlations that fully characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state. These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries and Deformations of Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlators of affine Kac-Moody currents evaluate to a sum over multi-color-trace contributions. We present a `single-trace current system' defined on a genus 0 Riemann surface, whose correlators evaluate to precisely the single-trace term in the evaluation of a standard affine Kac-Moody at level 1. We demonstrate that using the single-trace current system in genus 0 Berkovits-Witten twistor string correlators gives pure $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills tree amplitudes, and explain how this works both at the level of the string theory correlator and from the perspective of the effective field theory. We explain how using the single-trace current system in genus 0 correlators of the ambitwistor string gives pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes, and briefly discuss a proposal to go to higher loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel anisotropic quark star model in the backdrop of mimetic gravitational theory. Our study focuses on the strange quark stars using the MIT bag equation of state (EoS) admitting non-singular Buchdahl metric function. The proposed model matches the interior spacetime of the strange quark star with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Our analysis of the energy conditions, radial and tangential EoSs along with the energy momentum tensor gradients and TOV equilibrium condition analysis support the model's physical validity. Further study of adiabatic index, surface redshift function and speed of sound analysis have demonstrated the stability of the strange quark star in mimetic gravity. Thus, we can say that the model stability and consistency have been validated for various parameter values of the Buchdahl function throughout our study in the context of mimetic gravity.</description>

      <title>The Classification of 3+1d Symmetry Enriched Topological Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.</description>

Abstract: Instanton properties of the characteristic connection $\nabla$ on an integrable $G_2$ manifold as well as instanton condition of the torsion connection $\nabla$ on a $Spin(7)$ manifold are investigated. It is shown that for an integrable $G_2$ manifold with $\nabla$-parallel Lee form the curvature of the characteristic connection is a $G_2$ instanton exactly when the torsion 3-form is $\nabla$-parallel. It is observed that on a compact $Spin(7)$ manifold with $\nabla$ closed torsion 3-form the torsion connection is a $Spin(7)$ instanton if and only if the torsion 3-form is parallel with respect to the torsion connection.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Approach to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While we have several complementary models of confinement, some of which are phenomenologically appealing, we do not have the ability to calculate analytically even simple aspects of confinement, let alone have a framework to eventually prove confinement. The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory from the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is generally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient flow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The primary focus is on the running coupling $\alpha_S(\mu)$, from which confinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon condensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across different scales. Building on that, we derive $\alpha_S(\mu) \simeq \Lambda_S^2/\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\alpha_S = 0$ in accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor is the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which is a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical statements are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Imprints of quantum vacuum fluctuations on the gravitational field of a spherical mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild geometry, describing the gravitational field of a spherical mass in classical vacuum, is one of the most famous vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. Classical vacuum is an idealization that does not include quantum vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, and determining the form of the gravitational field of a spherical mass in quantum vacuum is an important step towards understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory. We formulate and prove general results on the space of static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes sourced by quantum vacuum fluctuations, obtained under the broad assumptions that the quantum vacuum energy density is negative and unbounded on Killing horizons. In particular, we show the generic replacement of Killing horizons by wormhole throats. We discuss how previous calculations in the literature that have used different prescriptions for the regularized vacuum expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor are particular cases of our general results.</description>

      <title>Leading-renormalon-free Trace-anomaly-subtracted $\sigma$-mass for Heavy Quarks up to Five Loops in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the leading IR-renormalon divergence in the perturbative pole mass of a massive quark resides entirely in the contribution from the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor in QCD. Consequently, the recently proposed trace-anomaly-subtracted $\sigma$-mass definition for heavy quarks is not only scheme- and scale-invariant, but also free from the leading IR-renormalon ambiguity. We further derive a formula connecting this $\sigma$-mass to the perturbative pole mass, solely in terms of the QCD $\beta$-function, quark-mass anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$ and a proper rewritten form of the pole-to-$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ mass conversion factor. Utilizing this formula along with the ingredients available in the literature, we present the explicit five-loop result for the perturbative relationship between the $\sigma$-mass and the perturbative pole mass in QCD under the approximation of keeping only a single quark massive. Given the theoretical merits of this mass definition and the availability of high-precision conversion relations, we encourage its application to high-energy processes with heavy quarks, e.g., $H \rightarrow b\bar{b} + X_{\mathrm{QCD}}$, and to current-current correlators used in determining heavy-quark masses and decay widths.</description>

      <title>AdS Black Hole Solution with a Dark Matter Halo Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and analyze a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) obtained as a static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations sourced by a cloud of strings (CoS) and a dark matter (DM) halo modeled by a Dehnen-type density profile. We first study the geodesic motion of massless and massive test particles, emphasizing how the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the DM halo parameters $(\rho_s, r_s)$ influence photon spheres, circular orbits, the BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then examine scalar perturbations via the effective potential and the associated quasinormal-mode (QNM) spectra, showing how $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$ deform oscillation frequencies and damping rates, thereby affecting stability diagnostics. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended phase space, deriving the Hawking temperature, equation of state, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and Smarr relation with natural work terms for $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$. We find that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative and sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical properties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity divergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlev\'e VI tau functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric tensor portals to dark matter I: creation of dark scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the creation of scalar dark matter through a symmetric tensor portal. We find that both freeze-in and thermal freeze-out through a symmetric tensor mediator can create scalar dark matter. The required tensor masses for freeze-in are much larger than for freeze-out for the same dark-matter mass, in agreement with the nonthermalization assumption in freeze-in scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically solve the constraints in General Relativity for two black holes with arbitrary momenta and spin up to third order in these parameters. We compute the location and geometry of the apparent horizon, which depend on the spins, momenta, relative orientation angles, and the separation between the black holes, and present the result in a coordinate-independent form. We also extract the ADM mass and the irreducible mass and verify their consistency. The final expressions are depicted in a coordinate-independent form. The results can be easily extended to any number of black holes and used to complement numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Solving the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with a Power-law Tail in $R^2$ Inflation: A Dynamical System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.</description>

      <title>An inequality for relativistic local quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between vacuum insensitivity and sensitivity to excitations in finite-size detectors, taking measurement locality as a fundamental constraint. We derive an upper bound on the detectability of vacuum excitation, given a small but nonzero probability of false positives in the vacuum state. The result is independent of the specific details of the measurement or the underlying physical mechanisms of the detector and relies only on the assumption of locality. Experimental confirmation or violation of the inequality would provide a test of the axioms of algebraic quantum field theory, offer new insights into the measurement problem in relativistic quantum physics, and establish a fundamental technological limit in local particle detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d&gt;0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schr\"odinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the nature of $X(2300)$ with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of an axial-vector particle $X(2300)$ in the $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \phi\eta \eta'$ process (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf134}, 191901 (2025)), we simulate its production in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=4.95$ GeV using the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 4.0. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and the final hadronic state (FHS) are simulated and recorded sequentially. Besides the excited strangeonium and tetraquark interpretations, we propose for the first time that the $X(2300)$ could also be a hadro-strangeonium state, in which a strangeonium and a light hadron are bound together. The excited strangeonium and tetraquark states are, respectively, produced by coalescing with $s\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS with the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The hadro-strangeonium state is generated by the recombination of $\phi\eta/\phi \eta'$ in the FHS with DCPC. We then calculate the $X(2300)$'s orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral classification for each of the above candidates. Given its quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$, the $X(2300)$ is identified as a $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$, an $S$-wave $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ or an $S$-wave $\phi\eta/\phi \eta'$ candidate. The production rates for the $X(2300)$ candidates with different configurations are estimated for the first time. Those for the excited strangeonium and tetraquark states are on the order of $10^{-4}$, while the hadro-strangeonium state is produced at a rate on the order of $10^{-6}$. Moreover, significant discrepancies are observed in the rapidity distributions and the transverse momentum spectra among the different configurations. These discrepancies could be served as valuable criteria for deciphering the nature of the $X(2300)$.</description>

      <title>Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
  We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass, radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Gravitational Phenomena in Higher-Order Curvature-Scalar Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between nonlocal and local quantum field theories, and search for a viable notion of "local limit" to relate the unitary models. In Euclidean space it is relatively easy to have nonlocal theories with well-behaved local limits. In Minkowski spacetime, instead, singular behaviors are generically expected. Relaxing some assumptions on the "form factors" considered in the literature, we identify a class of models that have regular local limits in Minkowski spacetime. We call the models "asymptotically local" quantum field theories (AL-QFTs) and show that their limits are theories with physical and purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We also build an asymptotically local deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>

We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the area of the de Sitter cosmological horizon is related to the entropy of the bulk spacetime. Recent work has however shown that the horizon encodes more information about the bulk spacetime than just the entropy. In this work, we show that the horizon contains all of the gauge invariant (diffeomorphism and $U(1)$) information about (static albeit unstable) configurations of charged and rotating objects placed deep inside the de Sitter spacetime. We study highly symmetric objects, such as dipoles and cubes, built of objects with electric charge and angular momentum at their vertices. We show how these configurations affect the geometry of the cosmological horizon and imprint detailed information about the objects in the bulk onto the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Consistent deformations in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for studying consistent interactions of local gauge theories, which is based on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ formulation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates in terms of finite-dimensional spaces and avoids working with quotient spaces such as local functionals or functionals modulo on-shell trivial ones. The structure that is being deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded presymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to encode the Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms of the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present version the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the presymplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a remarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be considered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent interactions. We also describe the underlying homological deformation theory, which turns out to be slightly unusual compared to the standard deformations of differential graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, the Chern-Simons and YM theories are rederived starting from their linearized versions.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Sheshmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed. A crucial ingredient will turn out being cobordism techniques for evaluating invariants.</description>

      <title>Amplitude prescriptions in field theories with complex poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee--Wick--Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Feynman integrals at large loop order and the $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau threefolds from Wilson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate the counting of refined BPS numbers on compact elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau threefolds $X$ to Wilson loop expectations values in the gauge theories that emerge in various rigid local limits of the 5d supergravity theory defined by M-theory compactification on $X$. In these local limits $X_*$ the volumes of curves in certain classes go to infinity, the corresponding very massive M2-brane states can be treated as Wilson loop particles and the refined topological string partition function on $X$ becomes a sum of terms proportional to associated refined Wilson loop expectation values. The resulting ansatz for the complete refined topological partition function on $X$ is written in terms of the proportionality coefficients which depend only on the $\epsilon$ deformations and the Wilson loop expectations values which satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations. Since the ansatz is quite restrictive and can be further constrained by the one-form symmetries and E-string type limits for large base curves, we can efficiently evaluate the refined BPS numbers on $X$, which we do explicitly for local gauge groups up to rank three and $h_{11}(X)=5$. These refined BPS numbers pass an impressive number of consistency checks imposed by the direct counting of these numbers using the moduli space of one dimensional stable sheaves on $X$ and give us numerical predictions for the complex structure dependency of the refined BPS numbers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the approach for considering fast charged particles scattering on targets of complex structure, which contain some isolated substructures, is introduced. Based on this approach, the differential cross section for scattering on the set of parallel planes with uniformly distributed atoms in each plane is obtained. It is shown that without account of thermal vibrations, the differential scattering cross section may be expressed analytically which simplifies the calculations.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as non- or hyper-relativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in 3D gravity for generic boundary subregion--including RT surface phase transitions--directly from the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our approach relies on the universal statistics of the algebraic conformal data and the large-$c$ behavior of conformal blocks with Cardy boundaries involved. We observe the emergence of 3D multi-boundary black holes with Karch-Randall branes from entangled states of any number of CFT's with and without Cardy boundaries. The RT formula is obtained directly from the CFT in the high-temperature regime. Two direct applications are: $\textbf{1)}$ A simple derivation of the multi-interval entanglement entropy for the vacuum state of a single CFT; $\textbf{2)}$ A CFT-based detection of the emergence of replica wormholes in the context of entanglement islands and black hole microstate counting. Our framework yields the first holographic random tensor network that faithfully captures the entanglement structure of holographic CFTs. These results imply that bulk spacetime geometries indeed emerge from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the dual field theory in the large-$c$ limi--a paradigm we refer to as $\textit{It from ETH}$.</description>

      <title>Co-Scaling and Alignment of Electric and Magnetic Towers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towers of electrically and magnetically charged states in quantum gravity often exhibit two important properties. First, the ratio of the mass (or tension) of electrically charged states to magnetically charged states is of order $e^2/(4\pi)$, which we refer to as "co-scaling." Second, in theories of multiple gauge fields, the towers of states that exhibit co-scaling have charges that point in approximately the same direction in charge space as measured by the gauge kinetic matrix, which we refer to as "alignment." After motivating these ideas with some heuristic arguments, we examine the spectrum of BPS states in the 5d supergravity landscape arising from M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In this setting, every tower of magnetically charged strings is paired with a corresponding tower of electrically charged particles that exhibits co-scaling and rapid alignment. In particular, this motivates a sharp mathematical characterization of the magnetic infinity cone in Calabi-Yau geometry. We propose a universal conjecture about quantum gravity: towers of charged states which, in some limit in moduli space, have maximally divergent charge-to-mass ratios always have corresponding magnetic partner states exhibiting co-scaling and alignment. Co-scaling is not a general feature of extremal black hole solutions in theories of gauge fields and scalars, suggesting that it is a principle of UV complete quantum gravity. We briefly remark on possible phenomenological applications, including to axion physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the S-matrix of transverse scalar excitations on an infinite $D=10$ GS superstring and $D=11$ supermembrane in flat target space. We compute the 4-particle scattering amplitude in the 2-loop approximation and demonstrate that, like in the Nambu string case, the $D=10$ GS string S-matrix does not contain non-trivial 2d UV divergences (UV pole not accompanied by terms with logarithms of momenta is an artifact of dimensional regularization). This is consistent with underlying integrability of this model which is maintaining by adding appropriate local counterterms. In the supermembrane case there are no 1-loop divergences but we find a genuine 2-loop UV pole. This demonstrates non-finiteness of the world-volume S-matrix of the M2 brane theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin "multi-copies", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields. Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.</description>

Abstract: The classification of primary non-trivial bilinear currents in the 4d higher-spin theory is obtained. It is interpreted in terms of the known classification of cubic Lagrangian vertices in the 4d higher-spin theory. It is shown that some currents join to the action with the tail of higher-derivative terms (as it happens with the Fradkin-Vasiliev $2-s-s$ vertex). The analysis is based on the $\sigma_-$-cohomology technique of the unfolded formalism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) &gt; a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. The solution to the scale factor satisfies an interesting symmetry between the far past and far future due to $a(t) = a(-t + 2 t_{\rm min})$, where $a(t_{\rm min}) = a_{\rm min}$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that three-party entanglement signals in holography obey a relation that is not satisfied by generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. This is the first known inequality on the structure of pure three-party holographic states, and shows that time-symmetric holographic states can never have purely GHZ-like entanglement. We also discuss similar relations for four parties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate a free scalar field in the Minkowski spacetime with a scalar field with a certain scaling dimension on a sphere of codimension two. This is realised by first performing a Radon transform of the ``bulk" field on the Minkowski space to a field on a hyperplane identified with a de Sitter or Euclidean anti-de Sitter slice. The Radon transform is identified in turn with a scalar field obtained from a sphere of one further lower dimension through the so-called bulk reconstruction programme. We write down the Mellin modes of the bulk field as generalised hypergeometric functions using the Lee-Pomeransky method developed for evaluation of Feynman loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Resolving BCFT bulk-cone singularities in braneworlds and top-down holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-point functions in BCFTs exhibit characteristic singularities compared to standard CFTs due to reflected light cones. In holographic BCFTs, further singularities, which need not be related to reflected light cones within the BCFT, can arise when the insertion points are connected by bulk null geodesics. The resulting `bulk-cone singularities' are expected to be an artifact of the `t Hooft limit and should be resolved in string theory. In this work we demonstrate the resolution of bulk-cone singularities in braneworld BCFT duals, where bulk-cone singularities arise from geodesics reflected off the end-of-the-world brane. We show that the geometry near the null geodesics is described by a pp-wave of shockwave form and incroporate string theory corrections, which bounds the two-point functions. We extend this discussion to top-down holography for D1/D5 BCFTs.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic open-string vertex algebras and Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1205.2977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. For $p$ in $M$, the tensor algebra of the negative part of the (complex) affinization of the tangent space of $M$ at $p$ has a natural structure of a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra. These meromorphic open-string vertex algebras form a vector bundle over $M$ with a connection. We construct a sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ of meromorphic open-string vertex algebras on the sheaf of parallel sections of this vector bundle. Using covariant derivatives, we construct representations on the spaces of complex smooth functions of the algebras of parallel tensor fields. These representations are used to construct a sheaf $\mathcal{W}$ of left $\mathcal{V}$-modules generated by the sheaf of smooth functions. In particular, we obtain a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ and a left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{W}$. By the definitions of meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left module, we obtain, among many other properties, operator product expansion for vertex operators. We also show that the Laplacian on M is in fact a component of a vertex operator for the left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ restricted to the space of smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Robust Areal Thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild Black Hole with Robin Boundary Conditions and Weyl Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.09128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an areal thermodynamics for the Schwarzschild black hole that takes the horizon area as the sole macroscopic variable. Quantizing ultrarelativistic interior modes on a regular spacelike slice with a Robin boundary at a stretched horizon leads to a self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami problem with Heun-type quantization. A maximum-entropy area ensemble introduces an intensive areal temperature $T_A$, and Weyl/heat-kernel asymptotics control the resulting statistical mechanics. The leading equations of state follow universally from the spatial Weyl volume coefficient: in a canonical ensemble of $N$ ultrarelativistic bosons one finds $A = 3 N k_B T_A$ up to a boundary-dependent constant, while in the massless grand-canonical sector $A \propto T_A^{4}$ with a generalized Planck spectrum and a Wien displacement relation. These scaling exponents are insensitive to Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin data and to the foliation; only numerical prefactors vary. Embedding the construction into a static four-dimensional background via Matsubara factorization reproduces the 4D Weyl law and yields a finite matter entropy $S_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto A^{3/4}$, parametrically subleading to the Bekenstein-Hawking term after standard renormalization. The framework provides a concise, mathematically controlled bridge between interior spectral data and macroscopic area relations, clarifying the scope and limitations of areal thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13343v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general form of soft and collinear factorization for hard-scattering amplitudes to all orders in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. Specifically, we present the generalization of collinear factorization to configurations with several collinear directions, where the most singular behaviour is encoded by generalized collinear splitting amplitudes that manifestly embed the breaking of strict collinear factorization in space-like collinear configurations. We also extend the analysis to the simultaneous soft-collinear factorization with multiple collinear directions where na\"{\i}ve multiplicative factorization does not hold. As an illustrative example of factorization breaking, we present explicit results at the one-loop level in the soft-collinear limit.</description>

      <title>Scheme-independent determination of the QCD running coupling at all scales from jet observables using the principle of maximum conformality and infinite-order scale setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We propose a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range by considering all possible intervals over the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region and selecting that which returns the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$. This new method is designed to eliminate the errors that arise due to selection of the bin-interval and that have been neglected in previous analyses. In particular, using data for thrust and $C$-parameter at the $Z^0$ peak from ALEPH, OPAL, DELPHI and L3 experiments, we obtain the average value: $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1182^{+0.0007}_{-0.0007}$, for the strong coupling. This determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is consistent with the world average...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are among the most well-known astrophysical objects, yet their physical realisation remains conceptually subtle. We analyse physical black holes -- light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer -- and investigate the properties of the matter required to support them. Taking Buchdahl's theorem as a benchmark, we show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of its four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that, for a sufficiently small spacelike region $B$, deviations of the metric field from flat space encode the information recorded by a quantum reference frame (RF) placed in $B$. This encoding underlies the metric's ability to specify infinitesimal proper times and proper distances that ideal observers would assign, without requiring their physical presence. For purely classical correlations between the RF and the quantum fields within $B$, our hypothesis reproduces the Einstein equation with an undetermined cosmological constant. In this regime, the metric encodes a classical description of the fields in $B$ as perceived by the RF. When local quantum correlations are included, the Einstein equation arises with a positive cosmological constant, proportional to the surface density of those correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we build an analog vortex-like spacetime endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the geometry of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon, characteristic of an acoustic black hole for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the case where the vortex flow is purely rotational. The resulting spectral properties is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of giant multiply quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime used here holds significant potential to replicate, qualitatively, the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black-hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the resonant topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing Planck scale effects on absolute mass limit in neutrino flavor evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the {square roots of the individual neutrino masses}, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time ($PT$) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with {balanced gain and loss mechanisms}. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, ORCA--KM3NeT, MINOS, Daya Bay, Hyper-Kamiokande, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could fall within the sensitivity of current experiments. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Structure of Kerr black hole spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the analogous Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes. The horizon surface gravities and Hawking temperatures at the extremal horizon limits are then calculated to show that they vanish.</description>

      <title>Spacetime foam correlation renders the cosmological constant (dark energy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wheeler's spacetime foams (wormholes) at the Planck length undergo quantum nucleation, oscillation and annihilation. Their collective excitations over foamy spacetime interact with field operators at large distances. We describe such collective excitation and interaction using an effective ``foamon'' field coupled with field operators. The Wilson renormalisation group approach shows that the foamon field theory evolves from an infrared scaling invariant domain to an ultraviolet one, when numerous particles are present. In these domains, the foamon field induces an effective action of field operators, and its correlation length sets a natural scale. Applying this to cosmology, we obtain the effective Einstein action for the Ricci scalar and the cosmological constant (dark energy), including its equation of state and interaction with matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Protected Topological Phases and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. It results in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results complement recent analysis in the literature and show that the total magic of a state is unable to detect topological phases, indicating either that a different property is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</description>
