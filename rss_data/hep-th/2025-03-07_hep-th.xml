      <title>Emergence of Unitarity and Locality from Hidden Zeros at One-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations into the geometric structure of scattering amplitudes have revealed the surprising existence of ``hidden zeros'': secret kinematic loci where tree-level amplitudes in Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory, the Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), and Yang-Mills theory vanish. In this letter, we propose the extension of hidden zeros to one-loop-order in Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory and the NLSM using the ``surface integrand'' technology introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. We demonstrate their power by proving that, under the assumption of locality, one-loop integrands in Tr$(\phi^3)$ are unitary if and only if they satisfy the loop hidden zeros. We also present strong evidence that the hidden zeros themselves contain the constraints from locality, leading us to conjecture that the one-loop Tr$(\phi^3)$ integrand can be fixed by hidden zeros from a generically non-local, non-unitary ansatz. Near the one-loop zeros, we uncover a simple factorization behavior and conjecture that NLSM integrands are fixed by this property, also assuming neither locality nor unitarity. This work represents the first extension of such uniqueness results to loop integrands, demonstrating that locality and unitarity emerge from other principles even beyond leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a kink-antikink ensemble in a quantum vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Universal self-gravitating skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-gravitating skyrmion is an exact solution of the Einstein $SU(2)$-Skyrme model describing a topological soliton with baryon number $B=1$, living in a $4$-dimensional space-time in the presence of a cosmological constant. Here we show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the Euler angles parametrization, this solution can be generalized to include arbitrary values of the flavor number and, consequently, allowing higher values of the topological charge. Also, we show that higher-order corrections in the 't Hooft expansion can be considered while still preserving the analytical nature of the solutions. Finally we will show that from the gravitational solutions it is possible to construct skyrmions in flat space-time at a finite volume.</description>

      <title>Quantum superposition of boundary condition in $\mathrm{PAdS}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantum superposition of boundary conditions in the context of the Poincar\'e patch of the two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space ($\mathrm{PAdS}_2$). Focusing on Robin (mixed) boundary conditions (RBC), we investigate the response function of the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector interacting with two or more scalar fields, each respecting a different boundary condition. The role of this quantum superposition is two-fold: i) it may represent different fields propagating on the same spacetime and interacting with an UDW detector or ii) it may describe an UDW detector on a superposition of spacetimes, each one with an inequivalent propagating field.</description>

      <title>Deformed Schur indices and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur index in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with $U(N)$ gauge group has a natural two-parameter deformation. We find that a matrix integral in such a deformed Schur index can be exactly evaluated by using Macdonald polynomials. The resulting expression is a simple combinatorial summation over partitions. An extension to line operator indices is straightforward. In particular, for an anti-symmetric representation, the line operator index has a relatively simple form. We further discuss infinite $N$ analysis and finite $N$ giant graviton expansions.</description>

      <title>Code construction and ensemble holography of simply-laced WZW models at level 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a code construction for Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models associated with simply-laced affine Lie algebras at level 1. The chiral primary fields of these rational CFTs can be parametrized by the elements of the outer automorphism group of the affine algebra, which is isomorphic to the discriminant group $G$ of the root lattice. We show that the classification of even, self-dual codes over the alphabet $G$ is equivalent to the classification of modular-invariant CFTs. Each individual CFT is dual to a Chern-Simons theory, after gauging the maximal, non-anomalous subgroup of its $1$-form symmetry group specified by the code. We calculate the ensemble average of these CFTs, which is holographically dual to ``CS gravity"-- where the bulk theory is summed over topologies. When the alphabet $G$ consists only of elements of square-free order, we explicitly show that this ensemble average reproduces the Poincar\'e series of the vacuum character, which can be interpreted as the CS path-integral summed only over handlebody topologies. However, when $G$ contains elements of non-square-free order, additional contributions from singular topologies arise.</description>

      <title>The Tropical Dirac Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the tropical analog of spinors by representing tropical geometries as foliated Riemann surfaces endowed with degenerate complex structures. We investigate tropical limits of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and explicitly construct its square root, which defines a tropical Dirac operator. We find that the tropical Clifford algebra is classified as a degenerate Clifford algebra with nilpotent generators. The nilpotent generator allows us to work with a new kind of representation that allows for Grassmann odd numbers, effectively supersymmetrizing the tropical spin bundle. We show through Dirac-Bergmann's quantization procedure, that the corresponding tropicalized quantum field theories enjoy a purely fermionic topological symmetry which can be expected to give a new class of path integral localization that we call tropical localization. We also discuss how the tropical Dirac operator, when twisted by gauge fields, obeys a tropical version of the Lichnerowicz identity, thereby demonstrating how Yang-Mills curvature should arise in the tropical limit.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons states of photons and gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an alternative quantization of the electromagnetic field around the Chern-Simons state $\psi_{CS}$ which is a zero energy solution of quantum electrodynamics. The solution determines a stochastic process which is a random perturbation of the self-duality equation for the electromagnetic potential ${\bf A}$. The stochastic process defines a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation with the initial condition $\psi_{CS}\chi$ where $\chi({\bf A})$ is an analytic function of ${\bf A}$ decaying fast at large ${\bf A}$. The method can be applied to a quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories by means of a stochastic self-duality equation. A quantization of massless spin 2 tensor fields (based on self-duality) and its extension to a quantization of gravity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantumness and entropic uncertainty for a pair of static Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a pair of detectors operating in Minkowski space-time and analyze the characteristics of various quantum resources within this framework. Specifically, we focus on examining the properties of Bell nonlocality, quantum coherence, the nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC), and measured uncertainty in relation to the energy ratio and the distance between the detectors. Additionally, we examine how the initial states influence these quantum properties. Notably, our findings reveal that both a larger energy ratio and a greater separation between the detectors degrade the system's quantumness. Moreover, we explore the evolution of entropic uncertainty and demonstrate its inverse correlation with both Bell nonlocality and coherence, highlighting the intricate interplay between these quantum resources. These insights provide a deeper understanding of quantumness in a relativistic framework and may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>What happens due to the baby universe effect in JT gravity? -- Analysis of correlation functions and ERB length at late time using three approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the correlation function in JT gravity using three approaches: by summing over all geodesics connecting boundary operators, integrating over the region of moduli space determined by the ``no-shortcut condition'' introduced by D.Stanford and Z.Yang, and using the formula for the universal spectral density correlation in the $\tau$-scaling limit. We find that the behaviors of the three results coincide at late times: they all exhibit a ``ramp'' instead of permanent decay. Using the third approach we also confirm that the ``plateau'' appears after $T_H=2\pi e^{S_0}\hat{\rho}_0(E)$. Overall, our results are consistent with the SFF analysis.
  We also calculate the ERB length $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ using the three approaches and find that the results are in good agreement with each other. We also find that the $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ grows as a cubic function in $T$ due to the contribution from geometry including one observable baby universe, and converges to a constant after $T=T_H$. For the geometry with one baby universe, we compute the size $\langle b(T) \rangle$ of the baby universe and find that it is of the same order as $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$. This result is consistent with the baby universe emission mechanism claimed by P.Saad.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>Unitary Rigid Supersymmetry for the Chiral Graviton and Chiral Gravitino in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) in $dS_{4}$. In this paper, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on $dS_{4}$: the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. By chiral, we mean that the corresponding field strengths are anti-self-dual, and the gauge potentials are complex, each carrying a single complex propagating degree of freedom. The global SUSY transformations are generated by the standard Dirac Killing spinors of $dS_{4}$. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on $dS_{4}$ by closing the commutator between two SUSY transformations on $so(4,2) \oplus u(1)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. This free theory cannot become interacting while preserving SUSY in a way that makes the spin-2 sector the true graviton sector of General Relativity, as the three-graviton coupling cannot be $u(1)$-invariant. We establish the unitarity of the free supersymmetric theory in two complementary ways. First, by studying the action of the superalgebra generators on the space of physical gravitino and graviton mode solutions. Second, by quantising the fields and explicitly constructing the complex quantum supercharges $Q_{A}$ and $Q^{A\dagger}$, we show that the trace $\sum_{A} \{ Q_{A}, Q^{A \dagger} \}$ is positive-definite.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we demonstrate that the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with continuous non-abelian $G$-flavor symmetry is a $BF$-theory with gauge group $G$. We show that gauging $G$-symmetry with a flat connection yields a theory with global symmetry characterized by exchanging the conjugate variables in the quantization of $BF$-theory. We construct the extended operators that generate the $G$-flavor symmetry and the $(d-2)$-form $\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetry of the gauged QFT. We demonstrate that $BF$-theory arises as the theory characterizing $G$-flavor symmetry of a QFT in the AdS/CFT setup. 't Hooft anomalies of the $G$-flavor symmetry are realized as extra terms in the action.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$ $D=4$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. In particular, this data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

Abstract: We present a unification scenario of the conformal and fuzzy gravities with the internal interactions, based on the observation that the tangent space of a curved space and the space itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. Accordingly, the construction is based on enlarging the tangent space, while it is formulated in a gauge-theoretical way.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of the QNEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC). Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner and can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Euclideanization without Complexification of the Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minkowski spacetime can be mapped by a series of projections in a higher-dimensional spacetime to a Euclidean space, constituting a process of Euclideanization shown here in detail for two dimensions. The result allows regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary values. However, there is no physical spacetime transformation that produces a Wick rotation. In avoiding this complexification process, the new Euclidenization procedure has important advantages in the transformations of the action principles, including fermionic fields and theories at constant chemical potential. In all cases, complex-valued amplitudes of the form $\exp(iS/\hbar)$ are mapped to real statistical weights $\exp(-S_{\rm E}/\hbar)$ with a Euclidean action $S_{\rm E}$. The procedure is also amenable to fields on curved background spacetimes as well as gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase and Quantum Oscillation from Multi-orbital Coadjoint-orbit Bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16289v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory for a multi-orbital fermionic system using the method of coadjoint orbits for higher-dimensional bosonization. The dynamical bosonic fields are single-particle distribution functions defined on the phase space. We show that when projecting to a single band, Berry curvature effects naturally emerge. In particular, we consider the de Haas-van Alphen effect of a 2d Fermi surface, and show that the oscillation of orbital magnetization in an external field is offset by the Berry phase accumulated by the cyclotron around the Fermi surface. Beyond previously known results, we show that this phase shift holds even for interacting systems, in which the single-particle Berry phase is replaced by the static anomalous Hall conductance. Furthermore, we obtain the correction to the amplitudes of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations due to Berry curvature effects.</description>

      <title>A First Look at "Continuous Spin" Gravity -- Time Delay Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that gravity is mediated by "continuous spin" particles, i.e., massless particles whose invariant spin scale $\rho_g$ is non-zero. In this case, the primary helicity-2 modes of gravitational radiation on a Minkowski background mix with a tower of integer-helicity partner modes under boosts, with $\rho_g$ controlling the degree of mixing. We develop a formalism for coupling spinless matter to continuous spin gravity at linearized level. Using this formalism, we calculate the time delay signatures induced by gravitational waves in an idealized laser interferometer detector. The fractional deviation from general relativity predictions is $O(\rho_g/\omega)$ for gravitational wave frequencies $\omega &gt;\rho_g$, and the effects of waves with $\omega \lesssim \rho_g$ are damped. The precision and low frequency ranges of gravitational wave detectors suggest potential sensitivity to spin scales at or below $\sim 10^{-14}$ eV at ground-based laser interferometers and $\sim 10^{-24}$ eV at pulsar timing arrays, motivating further analysis of observable signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a robust formulation to calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir force for plane-parallel multilayer setups with general dielectric constants. We derive recursion relations for multilayer reflection and transmission coefficients in the most general setups, which are essential ingredients for evaluating the Casimir energy. With the use of complex analysis techniques involving the argument principle, we carefully treat and subtract UV divergences and make clear the relation between the subtraction procedure and an actual physical setup. We also clarify the physical operational meaning of pole subtraction, which is required to utilize the argument principle in the calculation of the Casimir energy. Our formula is applicable to more general situations including chiral medium or Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to explain the large amplitude of the nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational wave background observed in pulsar timing arrays (PTA), primordial sources must be particularly energetic. This is correlated to the generation of large density fluctuations, later collapsing into ultra-compact mini-halo (UCMHs). We demonstrate that if dark matter is made of WIMPs, then photon and neutrino fluxes from UCMHs produced by curvature peaks, first-order phase transition and domain wall interpretations of the PTA signal, exceed current bounds.</description>

A member of th prestigious school of theoretical physics in Saint Petersburg, he made relevant contributions to a number of topics along his life. His activity ran in parallel with profound changes in his home country and the international arena. He was very much involved in this series of conferences, being the host of the 2014 edition in Saint Petersburg. In this presentation made at the XVI Conference on Quark Confinement and Hadron Spectrum I will provide a vision -- necessarily personal -- of his life and his activities and how these influenced many of us.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation in General Relativity and the 3+1 formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We propose a model of six dimensional $SU(7)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification compactified on $S^1/Z_2 /times S^1/Z_2$, which is a six dimensional extension of five dimensional $SU(4)$ gauge-Higgs unification predicting the weak mixing angle $/sin^2 /theta_W=1/4$ at the compactification scale. We investigate whether the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking is realized in our model. We find some solutions providing the electroweak symmetry breaking and a realistic Higgs mass. Corresponding to each solution, the compactification scale of the fifth dimension is predicted. Furthermore, we evaluate the weak mixing angle at the weak scale by using one-loop renormalization group equation and find it to be in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the E-string theory on $\mathbb{R}^4\times T^2$ with Wilson lines. We consider two examples where interesting automorphisms arise. In the first example, the spectrum is invariant under the $F_4$ Weyl group acting on the Wilson line parameters. We obtain the Seiberg-Witten curve expressed in terms of Weyl invariant $F_4$ Jacobi forms. We also clarify how it is related to the thermodynamic limit of the Nekrasov-type formula. In the second example, the spectrum is invariant under the $D_4$ triality combined with modular transformations, the automorphism originally found in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with four massive flavors. We introduce the notion of triality invariant Jacobi forms and present the Seiberg-Witten curve in terms of them. We show that this Seiberg-Witten curve reduces precisely to that of the 4d theory with four flavors in the limit of $T^2$ shrinking to zero size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of an open EFT for finite-temperature holographic systems with interacting fermions. In particular, we do this for Yukawa interactions in the bulk using the real-time formalism (grSK geometry). From the bulk perspective, this study corresponds to Yukawa scattering against a black hole, incorporating the effects of Hawking radiation. We derive an EFT in the exterior of the black hole and thus develop a Witten diagrammatic understanding of the scattering processes. This allows the explicit evaluation of boundary Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) correlators to arbitrary order, at tree-level in the bulk. Here we present explicitly the SK generating functional up to four-point functions. Finally, we represent the correlators in a column-vector representation that manifests microscopic unitarity and thermality, with all the statistical factors neatly folded in.</description>

Abstract: We present a general conjecture for evaluating the multiple-discontinuity integrals that appear in real-time holography using gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh (grSK) geometry. Our conjecture is valid for arbitrary non-derivative interactions with any number of bulk tree-level exchanges. It is also consistent with a unitary exterior EFT at finite temperature with correct causal structure. We present a set of Feynman rules underlying this exterior EFT and illustrate it with the computation of four and five-point functions.</description>

Abstract: We study free graviton entanglement between Rindler wedges in the Minkowski vacuum state via the Euclidean path integral. We follow Kabat's method for computing the conical entropy, using the heat kernel on the cone with the tip removed, whose resulting von Neumann entropy for photons correctly predicted electromagnetic edge modes. We find that, in addition to the bulk graviton contributions, the conical entropy has a contact term that can be attributed to a vector field anchored to the (d-2)-dimensional (Euclidean) Rindler horizon whose contribution equals d-2 times Kabat's contact term for photons. We suggest that graviton edge modes are hence the d-2 large diffeomorphisms which act internally within the Rindler horizon. Along the way, we address several known issues regarding graviton entanglement. We furthermore sketch how our results may be used to study edge modes in closed bosonic string theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the space of consistent tree-level extensions of the maximal supergravities in ten dimensions. We parametrize theory space by the first few EFT coefficients and by the on-shell coupling of the lightest massive state, and impose on these data the constraints that follow from $2 \to 2$ supergraviton scattering. While Type II string theory lives strictly inside the allowed region, we uncover a novel extremal solution of the bootstrap problem, which appears to contain a single linear Regge trajectory, with the same slope as string theory. We repeat a similar analysis for supergluon scattering, where we find instead a continuous family of extremal solutionswith a single Regge trajectory of varying slope.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstrom Gauss-Bonnet (RN-GB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with three horizon geometries (k=+1,0,-1) within the grand canonical ensemble. Using the recently developed topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, inspired by Duan's $\phi$-mapping theory, we analyze the black holes by treating both critical points in the phase diagram and black hole solutions as defects in the thermodynamic parameter space. Our results show that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the topological classification of RN-GB AdS black holes, distinguishing them from their RN AdS counterparts in the grand canonical ensemble, while aligning with their canonical ensemble counterparts. Complementary analyses of local stability using specific heat validate the implication of topological analysis. Furthermore, an evaluation of global stability via Gibbs free energy provides a comprehensive understanding on the system's phase structure. Notably, for k=+1, topological analysis suggests liquid-gas type phase transitions, whereas global analysis favors Hawking-Page transitions. For k=-1, topology indicates a single stable black hole branch, yet the global analysis reveals the presence of Hawking-Page transition.</description>

Abstract: In this note we construct a formulation of 4d pure Yang-Mills theory in the unfolded language of higher-spin gravity. It represents a first-order formulation possessing manifest diffeomorphism- and gauge-invariance. We make use of an unfolding method that was recently put forward and used to unfold scalar electrodynamics. We also discuss features of various unfolding maps defined by the unfolded equations.</description>

      <title>Linearization (in)stabilities and crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2306.17553 a new supersymmetric integrable QFT was constructed from the relativistic limit of the worlsdheet theory of AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3\times $T$^4$ superstrings with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz flux. The model is closely reminiscent of one previously considered by Fendley and Intriligator, though it enjoys twice as many supersymmetries. In this paper we study its finite-volume and finite-temperature properties. We formulate the string hypothesis for the Bethe--Yang equations, write down the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, and simplify them in the form of a Y-system. We obtain three decoupled sectors associated with massive, massless-chiral and massless-antichiral particles, for which we compute the UV central charge. We illustrate the similarities and differences between this model and the one of Fendley and Intriligator.</description>

      <title>The large-charge expansion in nonrelativistic conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) are associated with critical phenomena and phase transitions and also play an essential role in string theory. Solving a CFT is an extremely constrained problem due to conformal invariance -- the task essentially reduces to the computation of a set of numbers called the CFT data -- yet it remains highly nontrivial. In fact, CFTs usually are strongly coupled and thus require new tools that do not rely on perturbation theory. For these reasons, in the past few decades, they became one of the most active fields of research. A natural extension of these ideas with far-reaching implications for condensed matter systems -- in which relativistic effects are not manifest -- is to replace the Poincare group by the Galilean group, thereby opening the way to a precise formulation of a whole new class of critical phenomena in terms of nonrelativistic conformal field theories (NRCFTs). Many of the aforementioned tools developed to gain a better formal understanding of CFTs can then be adapted to gain a strong predictive power in systems with direct experimental relevance. In recent years, a new powerful tool has emerged: the large-charge expansion. It allows to systemically uncover part of the CFT data of theories with global symmetries, thereby revealing profound and universal features of these systems. Using the state-operator correspondence, most of the computations are further reduced to the evaluation of energy levels in a finite-density system described by a large-charge effective field theory, usually associated with a conformal superfluid phase. The large-charge dynamics in the nonrelativistic case is however richer -- and therefore, more challenging -- than its relativistic counterpart. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress which opened the door to many new exciting large-charge applications.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the three-loop contribution to the chiral effective potential in the massless Wess-Zumino model. It is shown that while the non-renormalisation theorem forbids divergent contributions to the chiral potential, in the massless case the finite corrections survive. There are only three three-loop supergraphs that give rise to a superfield effective action in the pure chiral sector. Two of them are UV finite while the third requires one-loop counterterm corresponding to the chiral field renormalisation.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory unifying the topological responses and anomalies of various gapless fermion systems exhibiting Fermi surfaces, including those with Berry phases, and nodal structures, which applies beyond non-interacting limit. As our key finding, we obtain a general approach to directly relate gapless fermions and topological insulators in phase space, including first- and higher-order insulators. Using this relation we show that the low-energy properties and response theories for gapless fermionic systems can be directly obtained without resorting to microscopic details. Our results provide a unified framework for describing such systems using well-developed theories from the study of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special exact solutions in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Removing the hypersurface orthogonal condition in the well studied Newman-Unti gauge, we obtain a generic asymptotic solution space which includes all possible origins of propagating degree of freedom. The asymptotic symmetry of the generalized system extends the Weyl-BMS symmetry by two independent local Lorentz transformations with non-trivial boundary charges, which reveals new boundary degrees of freedom. The generalized Newman-Unti gauge includes algebraically special condition in its most convenient form. Remarkably, the generic solutions satisfying the algebraically special condition truncate in the inverse power of radial expansions and the non-radial Newman-Penrose equations are explicitly solved at any order. Hence, we provide the most general algebraically special solution space and the derivation is self-contained in the Newman-Penrose formalism. The asymptotic symmetry with respect to the algebraically special condition is the standard Weyl-BMS symmetry and the symmetry parameters consist only the integration constant order. We present the Kerr solution and Taub-NUT solution in the generalized Newman-Unti gauge in a simple form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (quantum mechanically) modified model for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario where the exterior of the collapsing dust ball is a Hayward black hole spacetime and the interior is a dust Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. This interior cosmology is entirely determined by the junction conditions with the exterior black hole. It turns out to be non-singular, displaying a power-law contraction which precedes a de Sitter phase or, reversely, a power-law expansion followed by a de Sitter era. We demonstrate that cosmic inflation in the collapse setting is a mechanism that decelerates collapsing matter, thereby preventing singularity formation. We also analyse the global causal structure and the viability of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a study of brane formation in six-dimensional space. There is no a priori assumption of the brane(s) existence. However, the analysis of the generalized Einstein equations reveals that there are a set of metrics describing two static branes even in the absence of matter fields. The trapping of massive particles on branes is a consequence of the metric structure, which prevents these particles from moving between branes. It is shown that the communication between charged particles located on different branes provides by photons. Such positron-electron annihilation could be experimentaly study at the LHC collider. The Higgs field is distributed between the branes in such a way that it can serve as a Higgs portal connecting two worlds located on different branes. The values of the 4D physical parameters depend on the extra metric structure near the branes. A particular metric of the extra space was found to provide the observed value of the Higgs vacuum average. We also found a non-trivial effect of decompactification of the extra space when the Hubble parameter is varied.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers At Resonant Microwave Cavities</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we update the calculation of the sight distance for narrow-band detectors such as resonant microwave cavities, and the resulting maximal event rate. We find that the largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems. Even in the most optimistic setup, these events are anticipated to be extremely rare.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generating and Computing Quantum Periods in Exact WKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periods of rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. We develop a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of a differential operator. Restricting to operators which arise as the quantizations of polynomials, we are able to apply the Griffiths-Dwork reduction to the integrals. By developing this perspective, we find the reduction of all integrals in the asymptotic series to normal form through a finite calculation. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and optical properties of generalized Kerr-Schild spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the class of generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) spacetimes in dimensions $n\geq 3$ and analyze their geometric and algebraic properties in a completely theory-independent setting. First, considering the case of a general null vector $\mathbf{k}$ defined by the GKS metric, we obtain the conditions under which it is geodesic. Assuming $\mathbf{k}$ to be geodesic for the remainder of the paper, we examine the alignment properties of the curvature tensors, namely the Ricci and Weyl tensors. We show that the algebraic types of the curvatures of the full (GKS) geometry are constrained by those of the respective background curvatures, thereby listing all kinematically allowed combinations of the algebraic types for the background and the full geometry. A notable aspect of these results is that, unlike the case of Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes, the Weyl types of the GKS spacetimes need not be type $II$ or more special. Then, focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf k$, we derive the conditions for it to satisfy the optical constraint, extending the previous results of KS spacetimes. We illustrate the general results using the example of (A)dS-Taub-NUT spacetimes in $n=4$, where we also comment on their KS double copy from a GKS perspective. Finally, as an application of our general results, we obtain the full family of GKS spacetimes with a geodesic, expanding, twistfree, and shearfree $\mathbf k$, satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations, and identify it with a subset of the higher-dimensional vacuum Robinson-Trautman solutions. In passing, we also determine the subcase of these solutions that manifests the KS double copy.</description>

      <title>Fractional entropy of the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust in fractional anti-de Sitter quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study derives the mass spectrum and entropy of the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using the fractional Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The generalized fractional WDW equation is formulated using a fractional quantization map, demonstrating a correlation between the fractal mass dimension of the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust and L\'evy's fractional parameter $\alpha$ of the Riesz fractional quantum operator. These findings may provide new insights into the ramifications of the fractal behavior of cosmic structures in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation with T-Model Kaehler Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kaehler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge-singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kaehler potential. Keeping the Kaehler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kaehler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>
