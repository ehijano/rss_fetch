      <title>Remarks on Galilean electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that equations describing the Galilean electromagnetism in the presence of sources hold invariant under the l-conformal Galilei group for an arbitrary (half)integer parameter l. The group contains transformations which link an inertial frame of reference to those moving with constant accelerations of order up to 2l-1, thus pointing at potential dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Discrete versus continuous -- lattice models and their exact continuous counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and study the correspondence between discrete lattice/chain models of interacting particles and their continuous counterparts represented by partial differential equations. We study the correspondence problem for nearest neighbour interaction lattice models as well as for multiple-neighbour interaction lattice models, and we gradually proceed from infinite lattices to periodic lattices and finally to finite lattices with fixed ends/zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlocal Beam Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study investigates the dynamics of nonlocal beams by establishing a consistent stress-driven integral elastic using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach. Specifically, a PINN is developed to compute the first eigenfunction and eigenvalue arising from the underlying sixth-order ordinary differential equation. The PINN is based on a feedforward neural network, with a loss function composed of terms from the differential equation, the normalization condition, and both boundary and constitutive boundary conditions. Relevant eigenvalues are treated as separate trainable variables. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is a powerful and robust tool for addressing the complexity of the problem. Once trained, the neural network is less computationally intensive than analytical methods. The obtained results are compared with benchmark analytical solutions and show strong agreement.</description>

      <title>Orbit Elements from Kepler Solutions in Projective Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
