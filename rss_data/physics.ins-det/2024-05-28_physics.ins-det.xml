      <title>AI-Assisted Detector Design for the EIC (AID(2)E)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform the design of complex, large-scale detectors like the ePIC at the future Electron Ion Collider. Featuring a central detector with additional detecting systems in the far forward and far backward regions, the ePIC experiment incorporates numerous design parameters and objectives, including performance, physics reach, and cost, constrained by mechanical and geometric limits. This project aims to develop a scalable, distributed AI-assisted detector design for the EIC (AID(2)E), employing state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization to tackle complex designs. Supported by the ePIC software stack and using Geant4 simulations, our approach benefits from transparent parameterization and advanced AI features. The workflow leverages the PanDA and iDDS systems, used in major experiments such as ATLAS at CERN LHC, the Rubin Observatory, and sPHENIX at RHIC, to manage the compute intensive demands of ePIC detector simulations. Tailored enhancements to the PanDA system focus on usability, scalability, automation, and monitoring. Ultimately, this project aims to establish a robust design capability, apply a distributed AI-assisted workflow to the ePIC detector, and extend its applications to the design of the second detector (Detector-2) in the EIC, as well as to calibration and alignment tasks. Additionally, we are developing advanced data science tools to efficiently navigate the complex, multidimensional trade-offs identified through this optimization process.</description>

      <title>Discharge mitigation methods in MPGD-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reviews various methods used to minimize the probability of discharge occurrence in MPGDs or to mitigate the effect of spark discharges on the detector system. These include techniques that can reduce the probability that the fundamental discharge limits of MPGD structures are reached during detector operation, methods based on the HV scheme optimisation, or the implementation of resistive electrodes to enhance local discharge quenching capabilities in an amplification structure. In addition, design optimization and quality control methods to ensure stable, long-term operation of an MPGD-based detector, are considered.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Novel Application of Power Over Fiber for Electronics in a Harsh Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-over-Fiber (PoF) technology has been used extensively in settings where high voltages require isolation from ground. In a novel application of PoF, power is provided to photon detector modules located on a surface at $\sim$ 300 kV with respect to ground in the planned DUNE experiment. In cryogenic environments, PoF offers a reliable means of power transmission, leveraging optical fibers to transfer power with minimal system degradation. PoF technology excels in maintaining low noise levels when delivering power to sensitive electronic systems operating in extreme temperatures and high voltage environments. This paper presents the R$\&amp;$D effort of PoF in extreme conditions and underscores its capacity to revolutionize power delivery and management in critical applications, offering a dependable solution with low noise, optimal efficiency, and superior isolation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&amp;D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.</description>

      <title>The Final Frontier for Proton Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental concept to search for proton decay. Using paleo-detectors, ancient minerals acquired from deep underground which can hold traces of charged particles, it may be possible to conduct a search for $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ via the track produced at the endpoint of the kaon. Such a search is not possible on Earth due to large atmospheric-neutrino-induced backgrounds. However, the Moon offers a reprieve from this background, since the conventional component of the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino flux at the Moon is significantly suppressed due to the Moon's lack of atmosphere. For a 100 g, $10^9$ year old (100 kton$\cdot$year exposure) sample of olivine extracted from the Moon, we expect about 0.5 kaon endpoints due to neutrino backgrounds, including secondary interactions. If such a lunar paleo-detector sample can be acquired and efficiently analyzed, proton decay sensitivity exceeding $\tau_p\sim10^{34}$ years may be achieved, competitive with Super-Kamiokande's current published limit ($\tau_p&gt;5.9\times 10^{33}$ years at 90% CL) and the projected reach of DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande in the $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ channel. This concept is clearly futuristic, not least since it relies on extracting mineral samples from a few kilometers below the surface of the Moon and then efficiently scanning them for kaon endpoint induced crystal defects with sub-micron-scale resolution. However, the search for proton decay is in urgent need of a paradigm shift, and paleo-detectors could provide a promising alternative to conventional experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the burst phenomenon in SiPMs at liquid nitrogen temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burst effect of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) at cryogenic temperatures have been discovered few years ago looking at the dark count rate of SiPMs at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Bursts are trains of single signals that happen randomly and are clearly distinguishable from the primary DCR and correlated noise because of their particular time distribution. In this article we describe a detailed study related to both the external causes that triggers bursts and to the phenomenon, internal to the sensor, that produces this dark signals. We related the burst occurrence to the luminescence produced by some trapping centers in the SiPMs when they are excited by ionizing radiation that impinges on the sensor.</description>

      <title>Numerical Estimation of Primary Ionization with Noble Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics experiments, the numerical estimation of primary ionization is crucial. An advance study on primary ionization can help in minimizing the effects such as electrical discharges that can damage the detectors of high energy physics. We present the simulation of primary ionization of electrons and positrons with the noble gases using the geant4 toolkit. We obtained these primaries that have been separated from secondaries as these contribute towards electrical discharges and further damage the detectors. We also found that xenon gas shows highest primary ionization among the noble gases.</description>

      <title>Search for reactor-produced millicharged particles with Skipper-CCDs at the CONNIE and Atucha-II experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millicharged particles, proposed by various extensions of the standard model, can be created in pairs by high-energy photons within nuclear reactors and can interact electromagnetically with electrons in matter. Recently, the existence of a plasmon peak in the interaction cross-section with silicon in the eV range was highlighted as a promising approach to enhance low-energy sensitivities. The CONNIE and Atucha-II reactor neutrino experiments utilize Skipper-CCD sensors, which enable the detection of interactions in the eV range. We present world-leading limits on the charge of millicharged particles within a mass range spanning six orders of magnitude, derived through a comprehensive analysis and the combination of data from both experiments.</description>

      <title>Thousand foci coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy with 1089 foci, enabled by a high repetition rate amplified oscillator and optical parametric amplifier. We employ a camera as multichannel detector to acquire and separate the signals from the foci, rather than using the camera image itself. This allows to retain the insensitivity of the imaging to sample scattering afforded by the non-linear excitation point-spread function, which is the hallmark of point-scanning techniques. We show frame rates of 0.3Hz for a megapixel CARS image, limited by the camera used. The laser source and corresponding CARS signal allows for at least 1000 times higher speed, and using faster cameras would allow acquiring at that speed, opening a perspective to megapixel CARS imaging with more than 100Hz frame rate.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is essential to both science and technology. Phase-space squeezing has been shown to be an advantageous source of atoms, whereby the spread in momentum is decreased. Here, we show that the opposite squeezing may be just as advantageous. As a case in point, we analyze the effect of such a source on point source atom interferometry (PSI), which enables rotation sensing. We describe how a squeezed PSI (SPSI) increases the sensitivity and dynamic range while facilitating short cycle times and high repetition rates. We present regions in parameter space for which the figures of merit are improved by orders of magnitude and show that under some definition of compactness, the SPSI is superior by more than four orders of magnitude. The SPSI thus enables either enhancing the performance for standard size devices or maintaining the performance while miniaturizing to a chip-scale device, opening the door to real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Performance optimization for a scintillating glass electromagnetic calorimeter at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The successful realization of the EIC scientific program requires the design and construction of high-performance particle detectors. Recent developments in the field of scientific computing and increased availability of high performance computing resources have made it possible to perform optimization of multi-parameter designs, even when the latter require longer computational times (for example simulations of particle interactions with matter). Procedures involving machine-assisted techniques used to inform the design decision have seen a considerable growth in popularity among the EIC detector community. Having already been realized for tracking and RICH PID detectors, it has a potential application in calorimetry designs. A SciGlass barrel calorimeter originally designed for EIC Detector-1 has a semi-projective geometry that allows for non-trivial performance gains, but also poses special challenges in the way of effective exploration of the design space while satisfying the available space and the cell dimension constraints together with the full detector acceptance requirement. This talk will cover specific approaches taken to perform this detector design optimization.</description>

      <title>CaloPointFlow II Generating Calorimeter Showers as Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of calorimeter showers presents a significant computational challenge, impacting the efficiency and accuracy of particle physics experiments. While generative ML models have been effective in enhancing and accelerating the conventional physics simulation processes, their application has predominantly been constrained to fixed detector readout geometries. With CaloPointFlow we have presented one of the first models that can generate a calorimeter shower as a point cloud. This study describes CaloPointFlow II, which exhibits several significant improvements compared to its predecessor. This includes a novel dequantization technique, referred to as CDF-Dequantization, and a normalizing flow architecture, referred to as DeepSet- Flow. The new model was evaluated with the fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge (CaloChallenge) Dataset II and III.</description>
