      <title>Energy-Aware Metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a principled framework for designing energy-aware metaheuristics that operate under fixed energy budgets. We introduce a unified operator-level model that quantifies both numerical gain and energy usage, and define a robust Expected Improvement per Joule (EI/J) score that guides adaptive selection among operator variants during the search. The resulting energy-aware solvers dynamically choose between operators to self-control exploration and exploitation, aiming to maximize fitness gain under limited energy. We instantiate this framework with three representative metaheuristics - steady-state GA, PSO, and ILS - each equipped with both lightweight and heavy operator variants. Experiments on three heterogeneous combinatorial problems (Knapsack, NK-landscapes, and Error-Correcting Codes) show that the energy-aware variants consistently reach comparable fitness while requiring substantially less energy than their non-energy-aware baselines. EI/J values stabilize early and yield clear operator-selection patterns, with each solver reliably self-identifying the most improvement-per-Joule - efficient operator across problems.</description>

      <title>Green Optimization: Energy-aware Design of Metaheuristics by Using Machine Learning Surrogates to Cope with Real Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization challenges requires not only advanced metaheuristics but also continuous refinement of their internal mechanisms. This paper explores the integration of machine learning in the form of neural surrogate models into metaheuristics through a recent lens: energy consumption. While surrogates are widely used to reduce the computational cost of expensive objective functions, their combined impact on energy efficiency, algorithmic performance, and solution accuracy remains largely unquantified. We provide a critical investigation into this intersection, aiming to advance the design of energy-aware, surrogate-assisted search algorithms. Our experiments reveal substantial benefits: employing a state-of-the-art pre-trained surrogate can reduce energy consumption by up to 98\%, execution time by approximately 98%, and memory usage by around 99\%. Moreover, increasing the training dataset size further enhances these gains by lowering the per-use computational cost, while static pre-training versus continuous (iterative) retraining have relatively different advantages depending on whether we aim at time/energy or accuracy and general cost across problems, respectively. Surrogates also have a negative impact on costs and accuracy at times, and then they cannot be blindly adopted. These findings support a more holistic approach to surrogate-assisted optimization, integrating energy with time and predictive accuracy into performance assessments.</description>

      <title>Structural bias in multi-objective optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural bias (SB) refers to systematic preferences of an optimisation algorithm for particular regions of the search space that arise independently of the objective function. While SB has been studied extensively in single-objective optimisation, its role in multi-objective optimisation remains largely unexplored. This is problematic, as dominance relations, diversity preservation and Pareto-based selection mechanisms may introduce or amplify structural effects.
  In this paper, we extend the concept of structural bias to the multi-objective setting and propose a methodology to study it in isolation from fitness-driven guidance. We introduce a suite of synthetic multi-objective test problems with analytically controlled Pareto fronts and deliberately uninformative objective values. These problems are designed to decouple algorithmic behaviour from problem structure, allowing bias induced purely by algorithmic operators and design choices to be observed. The test suite covers a range of Pareto front shapes, densities and noise levels, enabling systematic analysis of different manifestations of structural bias.
  We discuss methodological challenges specific to the multi-objective case and outline how existing SB detection approaches can be adapted. This work provides a first step towards behaviour-based benchmarking of multi-objective optimisers, complementing performance-based evaluation and informing more robust algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Sparse Spike Encoding of Channel Responses for Energy Efficient Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ISAC enables pervasive monitoring, but modern sensing algorithms are often too complex for energy-constrained edge devices. This motivates the development of learning techniques that balance accuracy performance and energy efficiency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative, processing information as sparse binary spike trains and potentially reducing energy consumption by orders of magnitude. In this work, we propose a spiking convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) that learns tailored spike-encoded representations of channel impulse responses (CIR), jointly trained with an SNN for human activity recognition (HAR), thereby eliminating the need for Doppler domain preprocessing. The results show that our SCAE-SNN achieves F1 scores comparable to a hybrid approach (almost 96%), while producing substantially sparser spike encoding (81.1% sparsity). We also show that encoding CIR data prior to classification improves both HAR accuracy and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/ele-ciccia/SCAE-SNN-HAR.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic model of the insect visual system for natural image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Simulation-Based Inference for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Encoding Tactile Stimuli for Braille Recognition with Organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a transferable encoding strategy that maps tactile sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille letter classification accuracy of 61% with a single organoid, which increased significantly to 83% when responses from a three-organoid ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing architectures.</description>

      <title>FeNN-DMA: A RISC-V SoC for SNN acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads, and here we present a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it supports more complex neuron models and network topologies, and can simulate up to 16 thousand neurons and 256 million synapses per core. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Neuromorphic MNIST and Braille tactile classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Pascal-Weighted Genetic Algorithms: A Binomially-Structured Recombination Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. However, it remains an open question whether the default Euclidean space is the most suitable choice for LLMs. In this study, we investigate the geometric characteristics of LLMs, focusing specifically on tokens and their embeddings. Our findings reveal that token frequency follows a power-law distribution, where high-frequency tokens (e.g., the, that ) constitute the minority, while low-frequency tokens (e.g., apple, dog) constitute the majority. Furthermore, high-frequency tokens cluster near the origin, whereas low-frequency tokens are positioned farther away in the embedding space. Additionally, token embeddings exhibit hyperbolic characteristics, indicating a latent tree-like structure within the embedding space. Motivated by these observations, we propose HypLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that operates in hyperbolic space to exploit these underlying hierarchical structures better. HypLoRA performs low-rank adaptation directly in hyperbolic space, thereby preserving hyperbolic modeling capabilities throughout the fine-tuning process. Extensive experiments across various base models and reasoning benchmarks, specifically arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, demonstrate that HypLoRA substantially improves LLM performance.</description>
