      <title>A $q$-Exponential Operator Based on the Derivative of Order 1 and Summation of Bilateral Basic Hypergeometric Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a new $q$-exponential operator based on the $q^{\pm1}$-derivative $\D_{q^{\pm1}}$ of order 1 to derive summation formulas for bilateral basic hypergeometric series ${}_{0}\psi_{1}$, ${}_{1}\psi_{1}$, ${}_{1}\psi_{2}$, and ${}_{2}\psi_{2}$. In addition, we provide summation formulas for bilateral series whose terms are basic hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Balancing games on unbounded sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a set $T\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is called $V$-closed if $t \in T$ and $v\in V$ imply that either $t+v\in T$ or $t-v \in T$. The set $P(V):=\{\sum_{v \in W} v: W \subset V\}$ is clearly $V$-closed and so are its translates. We show, assuming $V$ contains no parallel vectors, that if $T$ is closed and $V$-closed, and $x \in T$ is an extreme point of $\operatorname{cl} \operatorname{conv} T$, then there is a translate of $P(V)$ containing $x$ and contained in $\operatorname{conv} T$. This result is used to determine the value of a special balancing game. A byproduct is that when $m\ge 2$ and is not a power of 2, then the $m$-sets of a $2m$-set can be coloured Red and Blue so that complementary $m$-sets have distinct colours and every point of the $2m$-set is contained in the same number of Red and Blue sets.</description>

      <title>Matroids arising from algebraic shifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the shifted simple graphs and the $3$-uniform shifted hypergraphs whose inverse image under exterior shifting is the set of bases of a matroid: those are exactly the hypergraphs whose hyperedges form an initial lex-segment. There are several examples of known matroids arising in this way: the simplicial matroid, the hyperconnectivity matroid and the area-rigidity matroid. For $k\ge 4$, we provide a similar characterization for shifted $k$-uniform hypergraphs satisfying an additional combinatorial condition.
  For symmetric shifting, we prove an analogous characterization for shifted simple graphs, where the classical generic rigidity matroid is an example of a matroid arising in this way.</description>

      <title>New linear invariants of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a parameterized family of invariants for $\ell$-uniform hypergraphs. To each $\mathbb{K}$-linear transformation $T:\mathbb{K}^{\ell}\to \mathbb{K}^r$ we associate a function $\mathrm{Sig}(-,T)$ that maps $\ell$-uniform hypergraphs to $\mathbb{K}$-vector spaces. Given an $\ell$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,E)$, we use $\mathrm{Sig}(\mathcal{H},T)$ to define an equivalence relation $\equiv_T$ on $V$ called $T$-fusion, which determines a quotient hypergraph $\mathfrak{F}(\mathcal{H},T)$ called the $T$-frame of $\mathcal{H}$. We show that the map $U:\mathbb{K}^{\ell}\to \mathbb{K}$, where $U(\lambda)=\lambda(1)+\cdots+\lambda(\ell)$, is universal in that $\mathrm{Sig}(\mathcal{H},T)$ embeds in $\mathrm{Sig}(\mathcal{H},U)$, and $U$-fusion refines $T$-fusion for any $T:\mathbb{K}^{\ell}\to\mathbb{K}^r$. We further show that $\mathfrak{F}(\mathfrak{F}(\mathcal{H},U),U)=\mathfrak{F}(\mathcal{H},U)$ for any $\ell$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, so $\mathfrak{F}(-,U)$ is a closure function on the set of $\ell$-uniform hypergraphs. We explore the properties of this one-time simplification of a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the deformed Laplacian matrix of trees and H-join graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates spectral properties of the deformed Laplacian matrix, which merges the Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrices of a graph through a one-parameter family of matrices. We present general results on the eigenvalues of these matrices for simple undirected graphs. Additionally, we analyze the spectrum of the deformed Laplacian in the specific cases of trees and H-join graphs. For trees, we derive strong results on the localization of eigenvalues, while for H-join graphs, we explicitly compute the spectrum of the deformed Laplacian.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}(K_{\aleph_0}, \hat{K}_{2,3})$ is a win for Player 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Strong Ramsey game $\mathcal{R}(B,G)$ is a two player game with players $P_1$ and $P_2$, where $B$ and $G$ are $k$-uniform hypergraphs for some $k \geq 2$. $G$ is always finite, while $B$ may be infinite. $P_1$ and $P_2$ alternately color uncolored edges $e \in B$ in their respective color and $P_1$ begins. Whoever completes a monochromatic copy of $G$ in their own color first, wins the game. If no one claims a monochromatic copy of $G$ in a finite number of moves, the game is declared a draw. For a $t \in \mathbb{N}$, let $\hat{K}_{2,t}$ denote the $K_{2,t}$ together with the edge connecting the two vertices in the partition class of size 2. The purpose of this paper is to give a winning strategy for $P_1$ in the game $\mathcal{R}(K_{\aleph_0}, \hat{K}_{2,3})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any sequence of binary alphabets $\mathcal{A}_1,\mathcal{A}_2,\dots$, there exists a cube-free word $c_1c_2\dots$ so that $c_1\in\mathcal{A}_1,c_2\in\mathcal{A}_2,\dots$. In particular, for every $n$, there are at least $1.35^n$ cube-free words in $\mathcal{A}_1\times\mathcal{A}_2\times\dots\times \mathcal{A}_n$. We also prove that if the list of alphabets is computable then one of these words is computable and its $n$th letter can be computed in time polynomial in $n$.</description>

      <title>Extremal diameters of 3-coloring graphs of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tree $T$, its 3-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_3(T)$ has as vertices the proper 3-colorings of $T$, with edges joining colorings that differ at exactly one vertex. We call the diameter of $\mathcal{C}_3(T)$ the 3-coloring diameter of $T$. We introduce the notion of balanced labelings of $T$ and show that the 3-coloring diameter equals the maximum $L_1$-norm of a balanced labeling. Using this equivalence, we determine the maximum and minimum values of the 3-coloring diameter over all trees on $n$ vertices and characterize the extremal trees.</description>

Abstract: We find a layered permutation $w\in S_n$ whose Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak S_w(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ has support of size asymptotically at least $n!/4^n$. This gives precise asymptotics for the growth rate of $\beta(n):= \max_{w\in S_n}|\mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak S_w)|$. We find a different layered permutation $w\in S_n$ whose Grothendieck polynomial has support of size asymptotically at least $n!/e^{\sqrt{2n} \cdot \ln(n)}$ and obtain more precise asymptotics for the growth rate of $\beta^{\mathfrak G}(n):=\max_{w\in S_n}|\mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak G_w)|$.</description>

      <title>On the Hypergraph Nash-Williams' Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014, Keevash proved the existence of $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems (equivalently $K_q^r$-decompositions of $K_n^r$) for all large enough $n$ satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions. In 2021, Glock, K\"uhn, and Osthus proposed a generalization of this result. Namely they conjectured a hypergraph version of Nash-Williams' Conjecture positing that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has minimum $(r-1)$-degree (denoted $\delta(G)$ hereafter) at least $\left(1-\Theta_r\left(\frac{1}{q^{r-1}}\right)\right) \cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition.
  The best known progress on this conjecture dates to the second proof of the Existence Conjecture by Glock, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus wherein they showed that $\delta(G)\ge \left(1-\frac{c}{q^{2r}}\right)\cdot n$ suffices for large enough $n$, where $c$ is a constant depending on $r$ but not $q$. As for the fractional relaxation, the best known bound is due to Delcourt, Lesgourgues, and the second author, who proved that $\delta(G)\ge \left(1-\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\right)\cdot n$ guarantees a $K_q^r$-fractional decomposition.
  We prove that for every integer $r\ge 2$, there exists a real $c&gt;0$ such that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ satisfies $\delta(G)\ge \max\left\{ \delta_{K_q^r}^* + \varepsilon,~~1 -\frac{c}{\binom{q}{r-1}} \right\} \cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition for all large enough $n$, where $\delta_{K_q^r}^*$ denotes the fractional $K_q^r$-decomposition threshold. Combined with the fractional result above, this proves that $\left(1-\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\right)\cdot n$ suffices for the Hypergraph Nash-Williams' Conjecture, approximately confirming the correct order of $q$. Our proof uses the newly developed method of refined absorption; we also develop a non-uniform Tur\'an theory to prove the existence of many embeddings of absorbers which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Permutation Flows I: Triangulations of Flow Polytopes (Research Announcement)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new broadly unifying family of combinatorial objects, which we call permutation flows, associated to an acyclic directed graph $G$ together with a framing $F$. This new family is combinatorially rich and contains as special cases various families of combinatorial objects that are frequently studied in the literature, as is the case of permutations, circular permutations, multipermutations, Stirling permutations, Catalan objects and their generalizations. When permutation flows are decorated with compatible shuffles, they also include the combinatorics of parking functions and their generalizations.
  This model is geometrically rich. We show that permutation flow shuffles define a family of unimodular triangulations of the flow polytope $F_G(a)$ on $G$ with an integer balanced netflow vector a where only the last entry is negative. As an application we provide a new proof of the Lidskii volume formula of Baldoni and Vergne for this family of polytopes and a reformulation of the same formula where every term is explained by the nature of the combinatorial objects involved. Permutation flow triangulations extend the Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy triangulations that were defined for the case where a=e_0-e_n. We provide a formula for the h^*-polynomial of the flow polytope as the descent enumerating polynomial of permutation flows.
  The model comes with an order structure induced by intuitive operators on permutation flows which we call the weak order. This order includes as special cases the weak order on permutations, the Tamari lattice, order ideals in Young's lattice, and their generalizations, among others. It was conjectured in 2020 by the three authors, together with Benedetti, Harris, and Morales, that this poset is in general a lattice. This conjecture has been recently established with independent proofs by Bell and Ceballos, and by Berggren and Serhiyenko.</description>

      <title>Structural Existence of Prime Constellations: Asymptotic Spectral Stability in Finite Sieve Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(\mu)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($\Omega(\mu^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Pairs of eventually constant maps and nilpotent pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tom Leinster gave a bijective correspondence between the set of operators on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent operator and a vector in $V$. Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.</description>

      <title>On stationary real matrix Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study when a real matrix Schubert variety is stationary with respect to the first variation. We first show that a necessary condition for its open dense regular part to be a minimal submanifold is that the corresponding partial permutation is vexillary. Among vexillary partial permutations, we establish minimality by a geometric argument when the Rothe diagram is of Grassmannian type and has at most two connected components. We further obtain, as a corollary, the minimality of those varieties that decompose as products of this type. These varieties include all determinantal varieties as well as some new minimal cones.</description>

Abstract: We show that the K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the four families of examples of symmetric toric Fano manifolds presented by Batyrev and Selivanova cannot be realized as metrics induced by immersions into projective spaces equipped with Fubini-Study metrics. We obtain a similar conclusion for the non-symmetric examples discovered by Nill and Paffenholz. A consequence is that a centrally symmetric toric Fano manifold admits a K\"ahler-Einstein metric induced by a projective immersion if and only if it is a product of projective lines. These results provide evidence for a broader conjecture characterizing which K\"ahler-Einstein metrics can be induced by projective immersions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max Cut for complete tripartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Max-$d$-Cut ($d$-QMC) problem is a special instance of a $2$-local Hamiltonian problem, representing the quantum analog of the classical Max-$d$-Cut problem. The $d$-QMC problem seeks the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian defined on a graph with $n$ vertices, where edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$. In recent years, progress has been made by investigating the algebraic structure of the $d$-QMC Hamiltonian. Building on this approach, this article solves the $d$-QMC problem for complete tripartite graphs for small local dimensions, $d \le 3$.</description>

      <title>Bounded-degree graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature have subexponential growth and diffusive random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric properties of graphs with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature, a discrete analogue of non-negative Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry. We prove that for each $d&lt;\infty$ there exists a constant $C_d$ such that if $G=(V,E)$ is a finite graph with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature and with degrees bounded by $d$ then the average log-volume growth and random walk displacement satisfy \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \log \#B(x,r) \leq \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log r}\right] = r^{o(1)} \] and \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \mathbf{E}_x [d(X_0,X_n)^2] \leq n \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log n}\right] = n^{1+o(1)} \] for every $n,r\geq 2$. This significantly strengthens a result of Salez (GAFA 2022), who proved that the average displacement of the random walk is $o(n)$ and deduced that non-negatively curved graphs of bounded degree cannot be expanders. Our results also apply to infinite transitive graphs and, more generally, to bounded-degree unimodular random rooted graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic Lebesgue's universal covering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal cover in $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ is a measurable set that contains a congruent copy of any set of diameter 1. Lebesgue's universal covering problem, posed in 1914, asks for the convex set of smallest area that serves as a universal cover in the plane ($n=2$).
  A simple universal cover in $\mathbb{E}^n$ is provided by the classical theorem of Jung, which states that any set of diameter 1 in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is contained in a ball $J_n$ of radius $\sqrt{\tfrac{n}{2n+2}}$; in other words, $J_n$ is a universal cover in $\mathbb{E}^n$.
  We show that in high dimensions, Jung's ball $J_n$ is asymptotically optimal with respect to the volume, namely, for any universal cover $U \subset \mathbb{E}^n$, $$ {\rm Vol}(U) \ge (1-o(1))^n{\rm Vol}(J_n). $$</description>

      <title>Orderings of k-Markov Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Markov numbers, introduced by Gyoda and Matsushita, are those which appear in positive integral solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz$. When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Additive relations in irrational powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and Asymptotic Formulas for Rectangular Partitions of the Hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-parameter generalization of the Catalan numbers: $C_{d,p}(n)$ is the number of ways to subdivide the $d$-dimensional hypercube into $n$ rectangular blocks using orthogonal partitions of fixed arity $p$. Bremner \&amp; Dotsenko introduced $C_{d,p}(n)$ in their work on Boardman--Vogt tensor products of operads; they used homological algebra to prove a recursive formula and a functional equation. We express $C_{d,p}(n)$ as simple finite sums, and determine their growth rate and asymptotic behaviour. We give an elementary proof of the functional equation, using a bijection between hypercube decompositions and a family of full $p$-ary trees. Our results generalize the well-known correspondence between Catalan numbers and full binary trees.</description>

      <title>On the distance spectral radius, fractional matching and factors of graphs with given minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fractional matching of $G$ is a function $f: E(G)\to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{e\in E_G(v_i)}f(e)\le 1$ for any $v_i\in V(G)$, where $E_G(v_i)=\{e: e\in E(G) \ \textrm{and}\ e \ \textrm{is incident with} \ v_i\}$. Let $\alpha_f(G)$ denote the fractional matching number of $G$, which is defined as $\alpha_f(G)=\max\{\sum_{e\in E(G)}f(e): f\ \textrm{is a fractional matching of} \ G\}$. Let $\{G_1,G_2,G_3,\dots\}$ be a set of graphs, a $\{G_1,G_2,G_3,\dots\}$-factor of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that each component of which is isomorphic to one of $\{G_1,G_2,G_3,\dots\}$. In this paper, we first establish a sharp upper bound for the distance spectral radius to guarantee that $\alpha_f(G)&gt;\frac{n-k}{2}$ in a graph $G$ of order $n$ with given minimum degree, where $0&lt;k&lt;n$ is an integer. Then we give a sharp upper bound on the distance spectral radius of a graph $G$ with given minimum degree $\delta$ to ensure that $G$ has a $\{K_2, \{C_k\}\}$-factor, where $3\le k&lt;+\infty$ is an integer. Moreover, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the distance spectral radius for the existence of a $\{K_{1,1},K_{1,2},\dots,K_{1,k}\}$-factor with $2\le k&lt;+\infty$ in a graph $G$ with given minimum degree.</description>

      <title>Matching, odd $[1,b]$-factor and distance spectral radius of graphs with given some parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, let $\mu(G)$ denote the distance spectral radius of $G$. A matching in a graph $G$ is a set of disjoint edges of $G$. The maximum size of a matching in $G$ is called the matching number of $G$, denoted by $\alpha(G)$. An odd $[1, b]$-factor of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph $G_0$ such that the degree $d_{G_0}(v)$ of $v$ in $G_0$ is odd and $1\le d_{G_0}(v)\le b$ for every vertex $v\in V (G)$. In this paper, we give a sharp upper bound in terms of the distance spectral radius to guarantee $\alpha(G)&gt;\frac{n-k}{2}$ in an $n$-vertex $t$-connected graph $G$, where $2\le k \le n-2$ is an integer. We also present a sharp upper bound in terms of distance spectral radius for the existence of an odd $[1,b]$-factor in a graph with given minimum degree $\delta$.</description>

      <title>On the $D_\alpha$ spectral radius of non-transmission regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with order $n$ and size $m$. Let $D(G)$ and $Tr(G)$ be the distance matrix and diagonal matrix with vertex transmissions of $G$, respectively. For any real $\alpha\in[0,1]$, the generalized distance matrix $D_\alpha(G)$ of $G$ is defined as $$D_\alpha(G)=\alpha Tr(G)+(1-\alpha)D(G).$$ The largest eigenvalue of $D_{\alpha}(G)$ is called the $D_{\alpha}$ spectral radius or generalized distance spectral radius of $G$, denoted by $\mu_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, we establish a lower bound on the difference between the maximum vertex transmission and the $D_\alpha$ spectral radius of non-transmission regular graphs, and we also characterize the extremal graphs attaining the bound.</description>

      <title>From semi-total to equitable total colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Independently posed by Behzad and Vizing, the Total Coloring Conjecture asserts that the total chromatic number of a simple connected graph $G$ is either $\Delta(G)+1$ or $\Delta(G)+2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the largest degree of any vertex of $G$.
  To decide whether a cubic graph $G$ has total chromatic number $\Delta(G)+1$, even for bipartite cubic graphs, is NP-hard. The resulting problems and research persist even for total colorings that are equitable, namely with the cardinalities of the color classes differing at most by 1. Williams and Holroyd gave a new condition to solve total coloring problems via the introduction of semi-total colorings. We focus on how to obtain equitable total colorings of symmetric cubic graphs and cage graphs by means of a variation of Kempe'a 1879 graph-coloring algorithm. Such variation takes semi-total colorings to equitable ones.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zykov's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ denote its number of vertices, and let $N(G,K_t)$ denote the number of copies of $K_t$ in $G$. Zykov's theorem (1949) asserts that for any $K_{r+1}$-free graph and $t \ge 2$, \[ N(G,K_t) \le {r \choose t}\left(\frac{n}{r}\right)^t \] We generalize Zykov's bound within a vertex-based localization framework.
  For each vertex $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ denote the order of the largest clique containing $v$. In this paper, we show that \[ N(G,K_t) \le n^{t-1} \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{c(v)^t} {c(v) \choose t} \] We further show that equality holds if and only if $G$ is a regular complete multipartite graph. \newline Note that if we impose the condition that, $G$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, then $c(v) \leq r$ for all $v \in V(G)$. Thus, plugging $c(v) = r$ for all $v \in V(G)$, we retrieve Zykov's bound.</description>

Abstract: A problem of reconstructing words from their subwords involves determining the minimum amount of information needed, such as multisets of scattered subwords of a specific length or the frequency of scattered subwords from a given set, in order to uniquely identify a word. In this paper we show that a cyclic word on a binary alphabet can be reconstructed by its scattered subwords of length $\frac34n+4$, and for each $n$ one can find two cyclic words of length $n$ which have the same set of scattered subwords of length $\frac34n-\frac32$.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham (Erd\H{o}s and Graham, 1980) asked if there exists an $n$ such that the divisors of $n$ greater than 1 are the moduli of a distinct covering system with the following property: If there exists an integer which satisfies two congruences in the system, $a\mod d$ and $a'\mod d'$, then $\gcd(d,d')=1$. We show that such an $n$ does not exist. This problem is part of Problem # 204 on the website www.erdosproblems.com, compiled and maintained by Thomas Bloom. We also study when the divisors of $n$ greater than $1$ can form a congruence system satisfying the above condition.</description>

Abstract: Disproving a conjecture of Bleicher and Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rational numbers infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

Abstract: Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible with the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order. Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature.</description>

      <title>Global Fluctuations of Gaussian Elliptic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spoke-arc decomposition of non-crossing annular pair partitions $NC_2(p,q)$ that records spoke type and orientation, isolates spoke-level contributions, and factorizes the dependence on the ellipticity parameter $\gamma$ into a spoke factor and arc weights. This yields closed-form descriptions of the limiting covariance of Gaussian elliptic matrices. As a corollary, we show that an independent family of Gaussian elliptic random matrices is asymptotically second-order free.</description>

      <title>New Obstacles to Multiple Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>
