      <title>Investigating nuclear effects in lepton-ion DIS at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the far-forward physics program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be useful to probe the hadron structure with GeV-TeV neutrinos and muons. In particular, these studies indicate that the measurement of the muon-ion and neutrino-ion cross-sections by the same experiment is feasible. In this paper, we investigate the impact of nuclear effects on the muon-tungsten ($\mu W$) and neutrino-tungsten ($\nu W$) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events at FASER$\nu$ and its proposed upgrade FASER$\nu 2$. We estimate the rates associated with the inclusive cross-sections and for events with a charm tagged in the final state considering different parameterizations for the nuclear parton distribution functions. These results point out that muon and neutrino-induced interactions probe complementary kinematical ranges and that a simultaneous analysis of associated events will allow to test the universality (or not) of the nuclear effects. Moreover, we propose the study of the ratio between the charm tagged and inclusive events in order to discriminate between the distinct modeling of the nuclear effects at small-$x$. Our results indicate that a future experimental reconstruction of $\mu W$ and $\nu W$ DIS events at the LHC is a promising way to improve our understanding of nuclear effects and decrease the current uncertainties in parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Neutrino Mass: Observable $n$-$\overline{n}$ Oscillations in UV Complete Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the European Spallation Source, are set to dramatically improve sensitivity to neutron-antineutron oscillation that is a direct probe of $\Delta B = 2$ baryon number violation. The discovery of such a rare process would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model and could point to specific unified theories that allow observable $n-\overline{n}$ transitions. We accordingly examine $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations within a unified framework that accounts for charged fermion masses and generates viable neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. More specifically, we show that $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations can arise from two specific topologies within two distinct $SU(5)$ scenarios. One topology requires a presence of two color-sextet scalars in the Type II seesaw framework, whereas the other involves a scalar sextet and a color-octet fermion in the Type III seesaw framework. While the former topology can be realized in the $SO(10)$/Pati-Salam frameworks, the latter finds a natural embedding in $SU(5)$, which constitutes one of the key novelties of our work. Remarkably enough, the same dynamics responsible for fermion masses also induces baryon number violation, thus linking $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations to the flavor structure of the theory. We show that upcoming searches of such $\Delta B = 2$ processes can probe new colored states with masses up to $10^{11}$ GeV that is well beyond the reach of colliders. This positions $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations as a rare low-energy portal to grand unification and ultra-heavy new physics.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Uncertainties Everywhere All at Once</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast, precise, and controlled amplitude surrogates are essential for future LHC event generation. First, we investigate the noise reduction and biases of network ensembles and outline a new method to learn well-calibrated systematic uncertainties for them. We also establish evidential regression as a sampling-free method for uncertainty quantification. In a second part, we tackle localized disturbances for amplitude regression and demonstrate that learned uncertainties from Bayesian networks, ensembles, and evidential regression all identify numerical noise or gaps in the training data.</description>

      <title>Theory overview: electroweak emission from heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important class of observables in the heavy-ion collision programme concerns probes which are not sensitive to the prevailing strong interactions of QCD. The emission of photons, weak gauge bosons, and leptons fall into this category. Here I will describe the current status of such investigations, focusing on the emerging theoretical picture and its uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. I) An improved z-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the implementation of two novel ingredients in the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) approach [1-4]. The first new ingredient is the explicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input data for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually taken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL $z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach fully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes hadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative way. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable kernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the application of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever data and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be useful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak semileptonic decays of hadrons. An explicit numerical application will be presented in the companion paper [6], where the effects of sub-threshold branch-cuts are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. II) Sub-threshold branch-cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the general framework of multiple dispersive bounds, firstly discussed in the companion paper [1], to the study of sub-threshold branch-cuts. We propose the simultaneous application of a double dispersive bound as a proper way to take into account unitarity constraints within phenomenological analyses of hadronic form factors in the presence of sub-threshold branch-cuts. Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5], is modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the pair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the effects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model and the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production region are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or lattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is presented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound. The comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the $z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that the $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most precise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable results with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the pair-production region.</description>

      <title>Towards a detection of reactor $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\tau$ oscillations with possible CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unprecedented detection of reactor $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\tau$ oscillations by using elastic antineutrino-electron scattering processes $\overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^- \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^-$ (for $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$), among which the $\overline{\nu}^{}_e$ events can be singled out by accurately measuring the $\overline{\nu}^{}_e$ flux via the inverse beta decay $\overline{\nu}^{}_e + p \to e^+ + n$. A proof-of-concept study shows that such measurements will not only be able to test the conservation of probability for reactor antineutrino oscillations, but also offer a new possibility to probe leptonic CP violation at the one-loop level.</description>

      <title>Shower formation in the presence of a string-inspired foam in space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

      <title>Higgs Signal Strength Estimation with Machine Learning under Systematic Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dedicated graph neural network (GNN)-based methodology for the extraction of the Higgs boson signal strength $\mu$, incorporating systematic uncertainties. The architecture features two branches: a deterministic GNN that processes kinematic variables unaffected by nuisance parameters, and an uncertainty-aware GNN that handles inputs modulated by systematic effects through gated attention-based message passing. Their outputs are fused to produce classification scores for signal-background discrimination. During training we sample nuisance-parameter configurations and aggregate the loss across them, promoting stability of the classifier under systematic shifts and effectively decorrelating its outputs from nuisance variations. The resulting binned classifier outputs are used to construct a Poisson likelihood, which enables profile likelihood scans over signal strength, with nuisance parameters profiled out via numerical optimization. We validate this framework on the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge dataset, yielding accurate estimation of signal strength $\mu$ and its 68.27\% confidence interval, achieving competitive coverage and interval widths in large-scale pseudo-experiments. Our code "Systematics-Aware Graph Estimator" (SAGE) is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Unified description of sum rules and duality between CP phases and unitarity triangles through third-order rephasing invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate that products of third-order rephasing invariants $V_{\alpha i} V_{\beta j} V_{\gamma k} / \det V$ of flavor mixing matrix $V$ reproduce all the nine angles of unitarity triangles and all the CP phases in the nine parameterizations of $V$. The sum rules relating the CP phases and angles are also decomposed into terms of these rephasing invariants. Furthermore, through ninth-order invariants, these fourth- and fifth-order invariants become equivalent, which can be regarded as a certain duality. For the phase matrix $\Delta$ and the angle matrix $\Phi$, $\Delta \pm \Phi$ are expressed in terms of even-permutations $X$ and odd-permutations $\Psi$ of third-order invariant. As a result, these are represented by the two concise matrix equations $\Phi = \Psi - {\rm X}$ and $\Delta = \Pi' - \Psi - {\rm X}$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven identification of heavy flavor decay leptons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heavy-flavor hadrons is topical in the era of precision measurements, which is useful to test theories based on pQCD. The heavy-flavor hadrons are produced initially during heavy-ion or hadronic collisions and are one of the best probes to understand the initial stages of the collisions as well as the system evolution. In experiments, the heavy-flavor sectors are studied directly via their decay to different hadrons or di-leptons or via their semi-leptonic decay, which is accompanied by additional neutrinos. However, their measurement in experiments is resource-intensive and requires input from different Monte-Carlo event generators. In this study, we provide an independent method based on Machine Learning algorithms to separate such leptons coming from heavy-flavor semi-leptonic decays. We use PYTHIA8 to generate events for this study, which gives a good qualitative and quantitative description of heavy-flavor production in $pp$ collisions. We use the XGBoost model for this study, which is trained with $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$~TeV. We use DCA, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum as the input to the machine. The ML model provides an accuracy of 98\% for heavy-flavor decay electrons and almost 100\% for heavy-flavor decay muons.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS and studies of hadronic structure with $N \to N^*$ transition GPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) describe matrix elements of nonlocal partonic QCD operators between the ground and excited baryon states and provide new tools for quantifying and interpreting the structure of baryon resonances in QCD. We discuss a description of non-diagonal Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering process involving a transition between a nucleon and a nucleon resonance in the $\pi N$ system within the framework of transition GPDs. We address the physical content of $N \to N^*$ and $N \to \Delta$ transition GPDs, review the existing theoretical models and present theoretical estimates of related observables for the kinematic conditions corresponding to the experimental studies with JLab@12GeV. We also discuss the perspective of exploring resonance production with help of transition GPDs and consider the application of the Froissart-Gribov projections to study excitation of nucleon resonances by means of QCD probes with spin-$J$.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the QCD sum rule method to study the semileptonic weak decay of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*-}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$ into the single charmed baryon $\Omega_{c}^{*0}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$, corresponding to a $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}$ weak transition. A three-point correlation function is calculated in both the physical and theoretical sides to derive the sum rules for the form factors of the transition. The analysis incorporates both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions up to mass dimension six. After determining the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and performing numerical calculations of the sum rules of the form factors, we extract the $q^2$-dependent fit functions for the form factors. The obtained fit functions are then applied to compute the decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in all lepton channels. Our results, when compared with the future experimental data, can test the Standard Model predictions and probe potential deviations from the theoretical expectations in the $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decay.</description>

Abstract: We present a model constructed within a non-supersymmetric framework capable of explaining both current neutrino oscillation data and the observed dark matter relic abundance. In this study, the Yukawa couplings are expressed as polyharmonic Maa\ss{} forms, and the non-supersymmetric left-right symmetric model is realized through the $\Gamma_{3}$ modular group, with neutrino masses generated via the Type II seesaw dominance mechanism. The analysis focuses on determining the neutrino oscillation parameters, the effective Majorana mass arising from the standard contribution, and the dark matter relic density. Our results indicate that the model strongly favours the normal mass hierarchy over the inverted one and prefers the lower octant for the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. Furthermore, the effective Majorana mass is predicted to lie in the range $10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ to $0.1\,\text{eV}$. In addition, the lightest sterile neutrino present in the model is considered a viable dark matter candidate. A sterile neutrino mass in the range $10~\text{keV}$ to $30~\text{keV}$ is found to yield consistent results for both the relic density and active-sterile mixing angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two basic concepts: the compositeness for resonance and the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole. Applying them to hadron states $X(3872)$, $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, and $T_{cc}$, we obtain their compositeness values and achieve deeper insights into their inner structure.</description>

      <title>Techniques for mass peak reconstruction in Searches for Long-Lived Heavy Neutral Leptons Decaying to a Lepton and a \(\rho\) Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise reconstruction of the mass peak of long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) helps to improve the sensitivity for sterile neutrino searches in both fixed-target and collider environments (e.g., SHiP and the LHC). We present an analytical framework for reconstructing the HNL mass peak in the semileptonic HNL decay channel \(N\rightarrow l\rho\) with \(\rho\to\pi\pi^0\), using only the lepton and the charged pion emerging from the decay vertex together with kinematic constraints and the known particle masses. Incorporating mass constraints from intermediate resonances (e.g., the \(\rho\) meson) or the parent particle (e.g., the \(W\) boson at the collider experiments), we propose two methods, suitable for experiments with displaced vertex tracking capabilities. The particle-level simulation's results demonstrate that the \(\rho\)-mass constraint method yields promising HNL mass resolution in both beam-dump and collider-based environments. The W-mass constraint method, limited to the HNLs produced via \(W\)-boson decays at the collider-based experiments, shows better HNL mass resolution than the \(\rho\)-mass constraint method.</description>

      <title>Bounds on SMEFT affecting multi gauge and Higgs-gauge couplings using two and three body spin correlations in $e^-e^+\to 3l2j\slashed{E}$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming electron-positron collider provides an ideal place to probe deviation from the Standard Model predictions with its clean environment, beam polarization and significant luminosity. We studied anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings~($VVW^-W^+, V\in\{\gamma,Z\}$), triple gauge couplings~($W^-W^+\gamma/Z)$, and Higgs-gauge couplings $(HVV, V\in\{W^\pm,Z,\gamma\}$) induced by $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant dimension-6 operators in $3l2j\slashed{E}$ final events with initial beam polarization. The phase space of two prominent amplitudes i.e, triple gauge boson production $(WWV)$ and vector boson scattering sub-processes, are selected with boosted decision trees. We employ the asymmetries related to polarization and spin correlation observables along with cross~section to constrain the anomalous couplings. The parity odd polarizations and spin correlations of jets from $W$ boson require flavor tagging which is done using artificial neural networks. We provide one parameter limits at $95\%$ confidence level combining cross~section and spin related observables. Finally, marginalized limits on all nine anomalous couplings are obtained with MCMC analysis. The limits are found to be insensitive to systematic errors and dominated by statistics. We find that the VBS-like events provides a tighter constraints to $c_W$ and $c_B$ Wilson coefficients (WCs) in comparison to limits from WWZ phase space. For the remaining $7$ WCs, WWZ contribute significantly to the overall limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a light fermion bound to a heavy one is expected to be described by the Dirac equation with an external potential. The potential breaks translation invariance, whereas the bound state momentum is well defined. Boosting the bound state determines the frame dependence of the light fermion dynamics. I study the Dirac limit of the exactly solvable 't Hooft model. The light quark wave function turns out to be independent of the frame of the bound state, up to an irrelevant Lorentz contraction. The discrete bound state spectrum determines corresponding discrete energies of the Dirac equation, which for a linear potential allows a continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Axions in REactor neutrino COherent scattering Detection Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear power plants are not only vital sources of clean energy but also powerful facilities for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. Due to the intense gamma-ray flux and an appropriate energy conditions, they are particularly well-suited for searches of light hypothetical particles such as sub-MeV axions and axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work, we propose to search for the ALPs in the REactor Neutrino COherent scattering Detection Experiment (RECODE), where two low-threshold, high-purity germanium detectors are placed at 11 m (near point) and 22 m (far point) from a 3.4 GW nuclear reactor at Sanmen nuclear power plant. With a 10 kg$\cdot$year exposure, we demonstrate that the expected sensitivities to the ALP couplings to the electrons and photons are competitive with or surpass the available results from the beam-dump experiments. A planned upgrade to 100 kg$\cdot$year will fully cover the so-called {$\it$ cosmological triangle} region, probing unexplored parameter space relevant to axions.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Semi-Inclusive Electron-Positron Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators (ECs) in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Semi-Inclusive Energy Correlators (SIECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all polar angles. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) helicity parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD. This calculation entails the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting functions govering the evolution of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). Within TMD factorization framework, we quantify the impact of radiative corrections by completing the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) prediction for lepton-hadron transverse momentum imbalance in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Our results provide the most precise theoretical input for probing the helicity structure and confined motion of quarks and gluons at future electron-ion collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Quark, lepton and right-handed neutrino production via inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a two real scalar singlet extension of the two Higgs doublet model. We study the vacuum structure, the bounded from below conditions, the restrictions from the oblique parameters S,T and U, as well as the unitarity constraints. We submit the model to collider and Dark Matter experimental constraints and explore its allowed parameter space. We compare randomly populated simulations, simulations starting near the alignment limit, and a Machine Learning based exploration. Using Evolutionary Strategies, we efficiently search for regions with two Dark Matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the complex singlet-extended 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (cS2HDM), a spin-0 Dark Matter (DM) model with a Higgs sector consisting of two Higgs doublets and a complex singlet, as a benchmark for LHC DM searches. The model predicts a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone DM candidate whose interactions with nuclei are naturally suppressed, while allowing for all sources of CP-violation under the assumption of flavour alignment in the Yukawa sector, which enables CP-violating interactions of the Higgs bosons even in the alignment limit. This feature makes the model attractive for studies of electroweak baryogenesis while accommodating a Higgs-portal DM candidate with standard thermal freeze-out. We confront the model with a comprehensive set of theoretical and experimental constraints, including Higgs-boson signal strength measurements, searches for additional Higgs bosons, DM relic abundance and direct detection, as well as electroweak precision observables and the electron EDM, with emphasis on the impact of the new CP-violating sources. For DM direct detection, we perform a one-loop computation of DM-nucleon scattering including CP-violating effects. We provide a public software package to facilitate future phenomenological studies of the cS2HDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a data-driven route to simulations, anomaly detection, among other applications. A central challenge lies in the hybrid nature of particle-cloud data: each particle carries continuous kinematic features and discrete quantum numbers such as charge and flavor. We introduce a transformer-based multimodal flow that extends flow-matching with a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet substructure and flavor composition.</description>

      <title>BWTP model for hadrons $p_{\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic flow $v_2$ in AA collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the phenomenological BWTP model, recently proposed by the author for the hadrons transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra measured at the LHC, is developed to also describe the hadrons $p_\textrm{T}$-differential elliptic flow coefficients $v_2$ in identical nuclei (AA) collisions of different centralities. The model describes well the available data on $p_\textrm{T}$-spectra and $v_2$ for any $p_\textrm{T}$ of various particles, from pions to charmonia, in Pb--Pb at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02~TeV, and in Xe--Xe at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.44~TeV. Also, predictions for OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.36~TeV are given. While the model is mainly targeting the LHC energies, it also works at much lower RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>The kaon off-shell generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the off-shell generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of kaons within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, employing proper time regularization. In comparison to pion off-shell GPDs, the effects of off-shellness in kaons are found to be comparable. The influence of these off-shell effects on GPDs is approximately $10\%$ to $25\%$, which is significant. Additionally, the $x$-moments of off-shell GPDs exhibit odd powers due to a lack of crossing symmetry, leading to the emergence of new off-shell form factors. We explore the relationships among the off-shell form factors for kaons, drawing an analogy with their electromagnetic counterparts. Our findings extend pion off-shell GPDs to include those for kaons while simultaneously addressing their associated off-shell form factors. Furthermore, we examine and compare the off-shell gravitational form factors of kaons with their on-shell counterparts.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied the mass spectra of doubly charmed pentaquark states with strangeness $S=0, -1$ by using the method of QCD sum rules. We use the parity projected sum rules to separate the contributions of negative and positive parities from the two-point correlation functions induced by the pentaquark interpolating currents. Our results predict the existence of some potential doubly charmed pentaquark bound states.</description>

      <title>Alien operators for PDF evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the scale dependence of parton distribution functions is vital for precision physics at hadron colliders. The well-known DGLAP evolution equation relates this scale dependence to the QCD splitting functions, which can be calculated perturbatively in terms of the anomalous dimensions of leading-twist gauge-invariant operators. The computation of the latter in general requires one to take into account contributions of gauge-variant (or alien) operators. In this talk, we discuss the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin. Specifically, using generalized BRST symmetry relations, we derive the one-loop couplings and Feynman rules of the aliens necessary to perform the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD. This provides an important step towards the determination of the four-loop splitting functions which will be of significant phenomenological importance at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Constructing new heavy-quark sum rule for $b \to c$ meson and baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heavy-hadron semileptonic decays proceeding via $b \to c$ transition, such as $B \to D^{(*)}\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$. In the heavy-quark limit, where the heavy-quark symmetry holds, we construct a general heavy-quark sum rule for these decays based on the spin decomposition picture. The relation holds directly for the squared amplitudes without requiring phase-space integration. We then apply this relation to reproduce the sum rule among $B \to D^{(*)}\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to $\Omega_b \to \Omega_c^{(*)}$ transitions and those involving excited states, such as $B \to \{D_0^*,D_1^*\}$ and $B \to \{D_1,D_2^*\}$.</description>

      <title>Signature of Majorana neutrinos in equal-sign W-production by lepton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question whether standard-model neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is presently undecided. In principle it could be decided in favor of a Majorana signature if same-sign charged lepton scattering would be observed to produce $W$-boson pairs, which is a lepton-number violating process. The cross section of this scattering process is computed; depending on the initial state the result gives access to different components of the mass matrix. It could also shed light on physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Doppler shifted Hawking radiation from acoustic black holes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hydrodynamic flow, with flow becoming supersonic at some point, the subsonic-supersonic boundary behaves as the horizon of a black hole. Possibility of detecting Hawking radiation from such acoustic black holes has been investigated in a variety of laboratory systems, ranging from cold atom systems, to condensed matter systems with hydrodynamic flow of electrons, to relativistic heavy-ion collisions (at relatively lower collision energies). Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, with boost-invariant longitudinal flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a wide rapidity window has eluded this remarkable possibility because in this case the black hole horizon is dynamical, moving away from center with sound velocity, leading to infinite red shift of Hawking radiation. We show here that such a conclusion is premature. The QGP flow at very large rapidities, necessarily deviates from Bjroken boost invariant flow. Due to this, an observer close to that region sees black hole horizon with a finite redshift. It leads to non-trivial prediction of Hawking radiation affecting particle momentum distributions for a window of rapidities, leaving near central rapidity regions unaffected.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure with the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation in full impact-parameter dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the newly available solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation with the full impact-parameter dependence, we extend the study of parton evolution from proton to nuclear targets. Since a key part of the scientific programme for future experimental facilities such as the EIC is to study gluon dynamics and shed new light on the phenomenon of parton saturation, we present predictions for key processes, such as deep-inelastic scattering or the diffractive production of vector mesons, on a variety of nuclear targets. Besides the standard BK equation, we employ its linearised version to identify a promising channel to search for gluon saturation in the nuclear collisions. Furthermore, we implement a tetrahedral model of oxygen to search for deviations from the standard, isotropic, Woods-Saxon approach. In addition to the future colliders, the presented results are also of interest for the current studies of nuclear vector meson production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Softening holographic nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryons in the holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model are described by instanton solutions on the flavor branes. A commonly used approximation for dense baryonic matter replaces the many-instanton solution by a simpler, spatially homogeneous, ansatz, which requires a discontinuity in the holographic direction of the non-abelian gauge field in order to account for topological baryon number. We point out that the simplest configuration with a single jump - often used in previous studies - results in matter at saturation density that is much stiffer than real-world nuclear matter. This is improved, although not completely remedied, by adding a second jump. We present a systematic discussion of all possible configurations up to four jumps, dynamically computing locations of and behavior at the discontinuities. We find solutions that continuously connect to those based on pointlike baryons, thus, for the first time, establishing a concrete link between the instantonic and homogeneous pictures. This is supported by translating the multi-jump profiles of the gauge field into gauge invariant multi-layer charge distributions. The most important of our novel configurations has a block-like structure in the bulk, becomes pointlike at low density and/or large coupling, and is energetically preferred over all previously studied configurations. Therefore, our work lays the ground for improved predictions from holography for dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Polarized tau decay and CP violation in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of $\tau$-lepton polarization in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) as a novel application of the intense electromagnetic fields generated in such processes. In particular, we analyze the decay distributions of polarized $\tau$-leptons produced via photon-photon fusion, focusing on both leptonic and semi-leptonic channels. We show that the external magnetic field present in UPCs induces a preferred spin quantization axis, which modifies the angular and energy distributions of $\tau$ decay products relative to the standard helicity frame. By formulating the spin polarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified polarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can retain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging. Furthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay products, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects. This framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC and future colliders to exploit polarized $\tau$ decays in UPCs as an application of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c} \ell^-\overline\nu_\ell$ Decays in Perturbative QCD Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_{b} \to \Lambda_{c} \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ (with $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$) within the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD). The six independent $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transition form factors are first calculated in the low-$q^2$ region using the $k_T$ factorization approach. These are then extrapolated to the full physical $q^2$ range via the model-independent $z$-expansion, incorporating recent lattice QCD results at high $q^2$. Based on the obtained form factors, we compute the branching fractions of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays. Our prediction for the lepton flavor universality ratio, $\mathcal{R}_{\Lambda_c} = 0.29^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, is slightly larger than the latest experimental measurement. In addition, we analyze several angular observables, including forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameters, and polarization asymmetries. These results offer valuable theoretical input for current and future experimental investigations of semileptonic heavy-to-heavy baryon transitions.</description>

      <title>A congruous approach with realistic cross section towards limiting sub-GeV dark matter from LUX-ZEPLIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) through the mechanism of being boosted by cosmic rays (CRs). We utilize the nuclear recoil data from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment for this purpose. Without the mechanism of boosted dark matter (BDM), sub-GeV DM particles are cold enough to produce detectable nuclear recoil in the LZ experiment above the detector threshold. We choose to work with the leading components of cosmic rays to take into account the boost due to them towards the cold DM. In the present discussion we worked on models consisting of a Dirac fermion $\chi$ with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and DM particles have non-zero coupling to the nucleons as per the model parameters. Specific examples of the energy dependence of the scattering cross section have been invoked through the secluded dark photon model and $U(1)_{B-L}$ model. Additionally, we present the upper bound on the interaction cross section due to the Earth shielding effect in the light of a systematic analysis of the energy loss by the BDM while traveling to the underground detector through the Earth's crust.</description>

      <title>Neutrino phenomenology in a Standard Model extension with $\mathbf{T^\prime\times Z_{10} \times Z_2}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Standard Model (SM) extension with $T^\prime\times Z_{10} \times Z_2$ symmetry for generating the expected neutrino mass matrix with the relation $(M_\nu)_{13}=(M_\nu)_{31}=-\frac{1}{2}(M_\nu)_{22}$ via the contributions of the Type-I seesaw and Weinberg-type operators. The proposed model possesses viable parameters capable of predicting the neutrino oscillation parameters being in good agreement with recent constraints. Our analysis reveals the predicted regions for the physical quantities, given as follows. The two mass squared splittings are $\Delta m_{21}^2\in (69.450, 81.380)\, \mathrm{meV}^2$ and $\Delta m_{31}^2\in (2.544, 2.554)10^3\,\mathrm{meV}^2$ for normal ordering (NO) while $\Delta m_{21}^2\in (69.460, 81.390)\, \mathrm{meV}^2$ and $\Delta m_{31}^2\in (-2.461, -2.454)10^3\,\mathrm{meV}^2$ for inverted ordering (IO). The lightest neutrino mass is $m_{\ell}\in (34.500, 34.600)$ meV for NO and $m_{\ell}\in(35.21,\, 35.32)$ meV for IO. The sum of neutrino mass is $\sum m_\nu \in (131.300,\, 131.400)$ meV for NO and $\sum m_\nu \in (157.500,\, 157.700)$ meV for IO. The Dirac CP phase is $\delta_{CP}\in (347.00, 348.00)^\circ$ for NO and $\delta_{CP}\simeq 284.50^\circ$ for IO, two Majorana phases are $\alpha\in (1.677, 1.915)^\circ$ for NO and $\beta\in (2.036, 2.324)^\circ$ for NO while $\alpha\in (358.100, 358.100)^\circ$ and $\beta\in (1.123, 1.132)^\circ$ for IO. Finally, the effective mass mass is $m_{\mathrm{ee}}\in (35.340, 35.430)$ meV for NO and $m_{\mathrm{ee}}\in (58.870, 58.950)$ meV for IO. Based on these results, the Yukawa-like couplings are estimated, which can naturally explain the charged - lepton as well as neutrino mass hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Role of density profile of sub-GeV dark matter in the properties of dark matter admixed quark stars with Bayesian analysis of dark-NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and oscillation properties of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs). The strange quark matter (SQM) is described with the well-known Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model and the self-interacting fermionic DM is included in a systematic manner. The self-interaction of DM is of four-Fermi type and the overall DM density is considered as a function of the baryon density of SQM with two free parameters ($\alpha$, $\rho_{sc}$). This work is the first to consider four-Fermi interactions between fermionic DM and SQM in DMSQSs. Certain experiments like LZ, XENON, DarkSide, CRESST, and LHC have almost ruled out the possibility of contact interaction between SQM and massive DM (in GeV order). Recently, the quest for sub-GeV DM has garnered significant attention. We show that recent astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars also do not support the presence of massive DM in DMSQSs. On the other hand, we find sub-GeV DM to successfully concur with such observational constraints. We also calculate the fundamental $f$-mode frequency ($f_f$) of the DMSQSs, which shows universality with compactness, mean density, and tidal deformability. Further, we investigate the prospect of detection of $f_f$ with respect to the projected sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors like aLIGO, A+, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. In our DMSQS model, the three free parameters are $\alpha$, $\rho_{sc}$, and the ratio of repulsive to attractive interaction in SQM ($G_V/G_S$), which are optimized by Bayesian analysis in light of various recent astrophysical data.</description>

      <title>Herwig 7 with the Lund String Model: Tuning and Comparative Hadronization Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of the formation of colour-singlet hadrons from coloured partons, known as Hadronization, is crucial for generating realistic events in Monte Carlo Event Generators. Due to limited understanding of the non-perturbative regime, physically motivated phenomenological hadronization models with tunable parameters are used and later tuned to the experimental data. Modern Monte Carlo generators primarily employ one of two hadronization models: the Lund string model, which is the default in Pythia, and the cluster model, which is the default in Herwig and Sherpa. In this work, we combine the Lund string hadronization model, as implemented in Pythia 8, with Herwig 7 using TheP8I interface. We tune the string model with Herwig 7's Angular Ordered Parton Shower (AOPS) to lepton and hadron collision data, resulting in the Les Houches Tune (LH Tune), which shows good performance across a wide range of observables. The LH Tune will be included in the Herwig 7.4 release. This development enables a direct comparative study of the two hadronization models within Herwig, both interfaced with the Angular Ordered Parton Shower, which serves as the main motivation behind this work.</description>

      <title>Baryons in the Nambu Jona-Lasinio models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The octet and decuplet SU(3)f baryons are studied with the Polyakov, Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model, in a diquark-quark approach, via the resolution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. This work includes estimations of their masses according to the temperature and the baryonic density, with or without the isospin symmetry. Several improvements of this modeling are proposed and tested: the treatment of the baryons unstable regime, the inclusion of the diquark momentum dependence, the possibility to model baryons without the static approximation, the description of the octet baryons via scalar and axial flavor components, the use of a Nambu and Jona-Lasinio diquark propagator instead of a structureless one. The effects of the color superconductivity on the nucleon mass are also investigated. Certain of the mentioned improvements can be applied simultaneously. The advantages and limitations of each of them are underlined.</description>

      <title>A generalized study of linear electromagnetic cascades in astrophysical sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.</description>

      <title>Mass-deformed Super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb T^4$: sum over twisted sectors, $\mathbf{\theta}$-angle, and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory with a small gaugino mass $m$ and vacuum angle $\theta$ on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Introducing a detuning parameter $\Delta$, which measures the deviation from an exactly self-dual $\mathbb{T}^4$, and working in the limits $mLN \ll \Lambda LN \ll 1$ and $ \frac{(N-1) m^2 L^2}{4 \pi} \ll \Delta \ll 1$, where $L$ is the torus size and $\Lambda$ the strong-coupling scale, we compute the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates to leading order in $m^2L^2/\Delta$. The twists generate fractional-charge instantons, and we show that summing over all such contributions is crucial for reproducing the correct physical observables in the decompactified strong-coupling regime. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the sum over twisted sectors, already at small torus size, projects in the $m=0$ limit onto a definite superselection sector of the $\mathbb{R}^4$ theory. In the massless limit, we recover the exact value of the gaugino condensate $|\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle| = 16\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, and demonstrate how a spurious $U(1)$ symmetry eliminates all $CP$-violating effects. Our results are directly testable in lattice simulations, and our method extends naturally to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Heavy-Ion Physics: A Data-Driven Analysis of Quark Matter Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven analysis of Quark Matter conferences from 2011 to 2025, investigating trends in geographical representation, research emphasis, and methodological strategies. Using a dataset of over 10,000 presentations, the evolution of heavy-ion physics through its premier conference series is examined. The distribution of presentations across countries and institutions shows the global reach of the field while highlighting opportunities for broader international engagement. Research topics show clear temporal trends, with certain physics concepts rising and falling in prominence, and a gradual shift from facility-focused to phenomenon-focused research. The analysis reveals increasing integration between theoretical and experimental approaches over time, reflecting a maturing field where these complementary domains strengthen and enhance each other. These findings provide quantitative insights that the evolution of heavy-ion physics is strengthened by international collaboration at conferences. The analytical methods developed here could help other scientific communities understand their own patterns of knowledge sharing and development.</description>

      <title>Improving the Precision of First-Principles Calculation of Parton Physics from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for computing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first principles using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field theory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion and perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables -- quasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon resummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates higher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative and power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical uncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further simplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of transverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative region. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton observables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently proposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access to unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios, which will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power corrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state contamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions, are expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state isolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have entered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement, which will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi thermodynamics of rotating black holes from locally Kiselev-type behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking-R\'enyi model requires the R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the R\'enyi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We have computed the second Fourier sine coefficient of the longitudinal spin polarization, $\langle P_{z} \sin 2(\phi_{p} - \Psi_{2}) \rangle$, as a function of multiplicity or centrality in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and in $p$+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV using the CLVisc hydrodynamic framework. The numerical results successfully describe the data in Au+Au collisions. However, understanding the data in $p$+Pb collisions remains a puzzle. Additionally, we have reported some recent developments in quantum kinetic theory and spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale scalar perturbations amplified during inflation can induce primordial gravitational waves through tensor-scalar interactions. A long-standing controversial issue is whether the one-loop corrections to tensor perturbations exist on large scales. Firstly, we demonstrate through direct one-loop calculations that one-loop corrections cancel each other out on large scales. We then proceed from the symmetry of the interacting system and directly prove, based on the Ward identity, the absence of one-loop corrections on large scales-without the need for specific loop diagram calculations. This is consistent with the results we previously obtained for scalar perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Deuterons with different polarization states have distinct shapes for their wavefunctions. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally control the initial-state collision geometry with the polarization of the light-ion targets in relativistic heavy-ion experiments. We study the charged hadron elliptic flow coefficients with respect to the polarization angle of deuterons in Pb + polarized deuteron collisions using a hydrodynamics + hadronic transport model. Hydrodynamic response to initial-state geometry predicts a distinct sign of $v_2$ correlated with the deuteron's polarization states, providing a clean test case for elucidating the collective origin in small collision systems.</description>

  for the strong interaction coupling constant $\alpha_{S}=0.6$ and
  $B^{1/4}=135$ MeV ($B$ is the bag constant), the observations of XTE
  J1814-338 constrain the mass of the bosonic dark matter to
  $m_{\chi}\leq 307 (\lambda /\pi)^{1/4}$ MeV ($\lambda$ is the
  dimensionless coupling constant of the bosonic dark matter).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures aim to highlight the remarkable symbiosis that currently exists between the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large, using the unsolved puzzle of the nature of Dark Energy as a vehicle for so doing. The lectures first summarize what we know observationally about the properties of Dark Energy (and the Dark sector more broadly) and then discuss several approaches to explain them. Along the way this involves determining the types of interactions that would on general grounds be expected to be present in the low-energy limit of fundamental theories involving the many hierarchy of scales we see around us. This includes (but is not limited to) a discussion of technical naturalness (and `t Hooft naturalness) as well as the arguments for their use as a criterion for distinguishing amongst candidate theories. Some recent approaches I find promising are briefly summarized at the end.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution and formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles during cosmological phase transitions with mltiple vacua. Using a semiclassical approach with initial velocity fluctuations, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, quantum effects do not lead to the formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles, while flyover transitions allow for their stable formation by overcoming successive potential barriers. The evolution of these bubbles, including wall acceleration, collisions, and the formation of trapped regions, is explored through numerical simulations. Our results show that the dynamics of double-layered bubbles differ significantly from standard single-wall bubbles, with implications for cosmological observables such as gravitational wave production and baryogenesis. These findings indicate that flyover transitions represent a complementary decay mechanism to the conventional quantum tunneling process.</description>

Abstract: We give an analytical expression for the last component of the spin polarization $P^{x}$, the in-plane polarization, in heavy-ion collisions that has, to our knowledge, not been discussed in theories nor measured in heavy-ion collision experiments. We also carry out a numerical study of $P^{x}$ using a hydrodynamic model simulation as a cross-check for the analytical formula. It is found that if the temperature-gradient contribution is neglected the simulation result for $P^{x}$ qualitatively agrees with the analytical one. The prediction of $P^{x}$ can be tested in experiments and will contribute to provide a complete and consistent picture of spin phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate S-wave kaon-nucleon ($KN$) interactions with strangeness $S=+1$ in lattice QCD using the time-dependent HAL QCD method. Employing $(2+1)$-flavor gauge configuration with $m_{\pi}\approx 137~\textrm{MeV}$ and $m_{K}\approx 502~\textrm{MeV}$, we calculate the $KN$ potentials at the leading order in the derivative expansion. The potentials in both isospin channels ($I=1$ and $I=0$) exhibit repulsion at short distances, while only the $I=0$ potential has a small attractive pocket at intermediate distances. The phase shifts computed from these potentials show no signals corresponding to resonances or bound states in both isospin channels, suggesting the absence of the $\Theta^{+}(1540)$ pentaquark in the S-wave $KN$ systems. The scattering lengths result in $a^{I=1}_{0} = -0.226(5)(^{+5}_{-0})~\textrm{fm}$ and $a^{I=0}_{0} = +0.031(62)(^{+0}_{-29})~\textrm{fm}$. Our results of the S-wave cross sections for $I=1$ are consistent with some of the experimental data within $2-3$ $\sigma$, while they deviate from others. The results for $I=0$, combined with recent studies on chiral perturbation theory, suggest that the scattering amplitudes in this channel are dominated by P-wave components rather than S-wave.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Exploring Data-Driven Corrections for $\phi$-Meson Global Spin Alignment Measurements" (arXiv:2508.18409)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method in arXiv:2508.18409 constructs a ``data-driven correction'' from combinatorial (pseudo-$\phi$) pairs and applies it to the signal. An explicit decomposition shows that the construction calibrates the background response rather than the signal: it is defined by the difference between an acceptance-free pseudo-$\phi$ surrogate and its data-level realization. Promoting a background-derived correction to a signal correction requires a strong physics proof that signal and background share identical detector response at the pair level -- including acceptance-anisotropy couplings and dependencies on parent kinematics -- which the manuscript does not establish. Consequently, local numerical proximity in a restricted region of phase space is incidental rather than evidentiary; validation must rest on mechanism, not numerical coincidence. Moreover, the pseudo-$\phi$ background is non-unique: with infinitely many admissible constructions, any apparent agreement for a few cases would not be dispositive -- no finite scan can substitute for a mechanism-level response equivalence. In the absence of such a demonstrated equivalence, the construction should be regarded as a background calibration rather than a signal correction.</description>

      <title>Solar models with protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Recent analyses have reported low lithium but high beryllium abundances on the solar surface; however, standard solar models (SSMs) predict Li abundances that are ~30$\sigma$ away from the observed value. In this study, we aim to develop solar models and compare them with the Li and Be abundance constraints. We examine the effect of protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing below the base of the surface convective zone. We compute ~200 solar evolutionary models for each case to optimize input parameters using target quantities, similar to the SSM framework. We confirm that turbulent mixing helps reproduce the surface Li and Be abundances within ~0.6$\sigma$ by enhancing burning. It suppresses gravitational settling, leading to a better matching of the He surface abundance ($\lesssim$0.3$\sigma$) and a smaller compositional gradient. We derive a new protosolar helium abundance $Y_{\rm proto}=0.2651\pm0.0035$. Turbulent mixing decreases the central metallicity ($Z_{\mathrm{center}}$) by $\approx$4.4%, even though accretion increases $Z_{\rm center}$ by $\approx$4.4%, as suggested by our previous study. Unfortunately, the reduction in $Z_{\rm center}$ implies that our models do not reproduce constraints on observed neutrino fluxes by $6.2\sigma$ for $^8{\rm B}$ and $2.7\sigma$ for CNO. Including turbulent mixing in solar models appears indispensable to reproduce the observed atmospheric abundances of Li and Be. However, the resulting tensions in terms of neutrino fluxes, even in the models with the protosolar accretion, show that the solar modeling problem remains, at least partly. We suggest that improved electron screening, as well as other microscopic properties, may help alleviate this problem. An independent confirmation of the neutrino fluxes measured by the Borexino experiment would also be extremely valuable.</description>

      <title>The nuclear surface diffuseness effects on the alpha decay of heavy and super heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We select 300 different parent nuclei in the range Z from 64 to 106. The proximity potentials Zhang 2013 and Guo 2013 are employed to calculate the nuclear potential. The influence of the nuclear surface diffuseness is applied in the calculations of interaction potential between the emitted alpha particle and daughter nucleus through the reduced radius parameter. The systematic analysis of the radial behavior of interaction potential with and without the surface diffuseness effect reveals that these effects play decisive role in the calculation of nucleus-nucleus potential at the touching radius of the two interacting nuclei. We indicate that its influence decreases outside the touching configuration. In addition, our results reveal that the barrier penetration probability of the alpha particle through the barrier decreases by imposing the mentioned physical effects. It is worth noting that the calculated alpha-decay half-lives using the Zhang 2013 and Guo 2013 proximity potentials accompanied by the surface effects agree very well with the available experimental data. The theoretical halflives are calculated for 50 super-heavy nuclei using the modified forms of the Zhang 2013 and Guo 2013 models. The comparison with available experimental data and also with different empirical formulas demonstrates that the Guo 2013 model is suitable to deal with the alpha decay half-lives of SHN. Then the predictions of alpha decay half-lives for 65 SHN with Z from 120 to 126 are made by using Guo 2013 model with the surface effects. We found that there is a good agreement between our predicted half-lives and those obtained from semi-empirical formulas such as Royer and UDL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed in machine learning tasks: models with enough capacity to easily cross the \emph{interpolation threshold} improve in generalization error compared to the classical bias-variance tradeoff regime. We demonstrate this behavior for the first time in particle physics data and explore when and where `double descent' appears and under which circumstances overparameterization results in a performance gain.</description>

      <title>Does the high-energy AMS-02 positron flux originate from the dark matter density spikes around nearby black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements made by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) have detected accurate positron flux for energy range 1-1000 GeV. The energy spectrum can be best described by two source terms: the low-energy background diffusion term and an unknown high-energy source term. In this article, we discuss the possibility of the emission of positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in two nearby black hole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. We show that the dark matter density spikes around these two black holes can best produce the observed AMS-02 high-energy positron flux due to dark matter annihilation with rest mass $m_{\rm DM} \approx 8000$ GeV via the $W^+W^-$ annihilation channel. This initiates a new proposal to account for the unknown high-energy source term in the AMS-02 positron spectrum.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves induced by matter isocurvature in general cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis of DECAL Sensor Noise for the Generation of Truly Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore here the stochastic behavior of the DECAL sensor's noise output, and we evaluate its potential application as a true random number generator (TRNG) using time series analysis. The main objectives are twofold: first, to characterize the intrinsic noise properties of the DECAL sensor in the absence of external stimuli, and second, to determine the feasibility of employing the sensor as a source of randomness. The collected sensor data are examined through statistical and time series methodologies, and subsequently modeled using an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. This modeling approach enables the transformation of the sensor's raw noise into a Gaussian white noise sequence, which serves as the basis for generating random bits. The resulting random numbers are subjected to a series of statistical tests for randomness, including the NIST test suite. Our findings indicate that the method produces statistically sound random numbers. However, the rate of bit generation is relatively low, limiting its practicality for real-time TRNG applications under the current configuration. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that time series modeling presents a promising framework for extracting randomness from the DECAL sensor, and that with further optimization, the sensor could serve as a reliable and effective TRNG.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow for parton distribution functions: first application to the pion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are central to precision QCD phenomenology. Their Mellin moments can be computed on the lattice, but direct determinations using local operators, besides $\langle x \rangle$, face severe challenges from reduced hypercubic symmetry, limiting results to the lowest moments. A recently proposed method resolves these issues using gradient flow. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by computing ratios of flavor non-singlet pion PDF moments up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$, on four lattice spacings at $m_\pi \simeq 411$ MeV. The moments and reconstructed PDF agree quantitatively with recent phenomenological extractions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference favors quark matter in neutron star interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a physics-informed Bayesian analyses of the equation of state of hybrid neutron stars that incorporates color-flavor-locked quark matter modeled by a three-flavor non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio framework with vector repulsion and diquark pairing. Contrary to the model-agnostic Bayesian analyses our scheme allows for distinguishing between the scenarios of neutron stars with quark cores and without them. The used quark model realizes asymptotic conformality at high densities in accordance with perturbative QCD. The hadronic sector is described by the density-dependent relativistic functional DD2Y-T, which satisfies chiral effective field theory constraints and includes hyperonic degrees of freedom. We construct a large set of candidate hybrid EOSs by varying the vector and diquark couplings and apply a Maxwell construction for the quark-hadron phase transition. Observational constraints from recent NICER pulsar mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability from GW170817 are incorporated into the likelihood. Depending on whether the observational data from the black widow pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the HESS J1731-347 object are included to the analysis or not, the posterior distribution favors vector and diquark couplings around $(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.82,0.40)$ or $(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.64,0.36)$, respectively. This corresponds to equations of state that support two-solar-mass neutron stars with superconformal speed of sound and relatively low onset densities for deconfinement. Our findings indicate that the most probable hybrid EOSs are statistically preferred over the purely hadronic baseline. The corresponding probabilities of agreeing with the observational data differ by one or two orders of magnitude depending on the data set used. This suggests that quark cores may exist in all observed neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reinterpretation of selected ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs boson decays into long-lived particles (LLPs) within the scalar portal framework, where the standard model is extended by a light scalar that mixes with the Higgs boson. Using public HEPData results, we evaluate the sensitivity of several experimental strategies targeting different final states. The analysis shows how published searches probe complementary regions of the model parameter space, and it provides a comparative assessment of their coverage. The study also identifies the existing gaps in phase space coverage and highlights key areas for future improvement in LLP searches, which will be crucial to maximize the discovery potential for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into LLPs. Finally, we extrapolate the constraints to the integrated luminosity of the High-Luminosity LHC under different assumptions and compare them with the projected sensitivities of proposed dedicated LLP experiments at CERN.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet crucial endeavour. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding. Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data register, and utilising a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Probing $CP$ violation and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter through quantum speed limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve from a given initial state to a final state. In this work, we investigate $CP$ violation and the mass ordering problem of neutrino oscillations in matter using the QSL time as a key analytical tool. We examine the QSL time for the unitary evolution of two- and three-flavor neutrino states, both in vacuum and in the presence of matter. Two-flavor neutrino oscillations are used as a precursor to their three-flavor counterparts. We further compute the QSL time for neutrino state evolution and entanglement in terms of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities, which are experimentally measurable quantities in neutrino experiments. A difference in the QSL time between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios, for neutrino state evolution as well as for entanglement, under the effect of a $CP$ violation phase is observed. Our results are illustrated using the length scales and energies of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. Notably, three-flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density exhibit faster state evolution across all these neutrino experiments in the normal mass ordering scenario. Additionally, we observe fast entanglement suppression in DUNE assuming a normal mass ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with the exponential $f(R)$ gravity model, which introduces only one additional parameter $\beta$ compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This model incorporated axions as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both a non-supersymmetric model with heavy right-handed neutrino decay and a supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both cases, we have shown that the required baryonic asymmetry could be obtained. We have also shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with the $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number-violating model parameters are constrained with the $\beta$ through the decoupling temperature. An upper bound on the $\beta$ parameter of the exponential $f(R)$ gravity is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. In this Letter for the first time we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to nucleon's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization approach, specifically within the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Taking the nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) determined from the recent lattice simulations as input, we find that the state-of-the-art pQCD predictions significantly underestimate the available nucleon Dirac form factors in both space-like and time-like domains. This nuisance indicates that some additional soft nonfactorizable contribution might be called for to account for the measured nucleon electromagnetic form factor data up to $Q^2\approx 30\;{\rm GeV^2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar with a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Inflation is characterized by two parameters, the vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which give rise to a variety of inflationary structures. We categorize the potential trajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions consistent with current observational data. Furthermore, we examine the reheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the subsequent lepton number generation within these parameter regions. Our finding suggests that the existence of multiple fields can significantly alter the possibilities of successful reheating and leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order evolution of structure functions without PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and numerically solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi~(DGLAP) evolution equations at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory directly for a basis of 6 physical, observable structure functions in deeply inelastic scattering. By expressing the evolution in the physical basis one evades the factorization scale and scheme dependence. Working in terms of observable quantities, rather than parametrizing and fitting unobservable parton distribution functions (PDFs), provides an unambiguous way to confront predictions of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics with experimental measurements. We compare numerical results for the DGLAP evolution for structure functions in the physical basis to the conventional evolution with PDFs.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass effects in off-light-cone distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop correction to the forward matrix element of an off-light-cone bi-local quark correlator characterised by a space-like separation $z^2$ in the presence of heavy quarks with mass $m$. This calculation allows us to extract the one-loop matching kernel, necessary to connect quasi and pseudo-distributions to collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), accounting for heavy-quark mass effects. Our result is exact in that it includes all powers of $z^2m^2$ at one loop in $\alpha_s$. In the limit $z^2m^2\rightarrow 0$, it consistently reduces to the known massless result. We also carry out an implementation of our expression, which allows us to compute the charm pseudo-distribution of the proton given its PDF. We finally comment on the quantitative impact of heavy-quark mass corrections.</description>

      <title>Laser induced Compton Scattering to Dark Matter in Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of light dark matter (DM) is a longstanding challenge in terrestrial experiments. High-intensity facility of an intense electromagnetic field may provide a plausible strategy to study strong-field particle physics and search for light DM. In this work, we propose to search for light DM particle through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high-intense laser field. An ultra-relativistic electron beam collides with an intense laser pulse of a number of optical photons and then decays to a pair of DM particles. We take into account the Dirac-type fermionic DM in leptophilic scenario and the DM-electron interactions in the framework of effective field theory. The decay rates of electron to a DM pair are calculated for effective DM operators of different bilinear products. We show the sensitivities of laser induced Compton scattering to the effective cutoff scale for DM lighter than 1 MeV and compare with direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose detecting dark photons (DP), a major candidate for wave dark matter, through polarimetry. The DP can modify Maxwell's equations due to its kinetic mixing with regular photons, inducing an oscillating component in the electromagnetic field. This may leave an imprint on polarimetric light signals, such as Faraday rotation, characterized by a distinctive wave pattern in spacetime. We then apply this method to investigate ultralight DPs produced through the superradiance of supermassive black holes for demonstration. Using the polarimetric measurements of radiation from the M87$^\ast$ and Sgr A$^\ast$ at the Event Horizon Telescope, we show that novel limits on the photon-DP mixing parameter can be set for the rarely-explored DP mass ranges: explicitly $10^{-22} - 10^{-20}\,$eV with the best reach of $\sim 10^{-8}$ achieved at $\sim 10^{-20}$eV, and $10^{-19} - 10^{-17}\,$eV with the best reach of $\sim 10^{-11}$ achieved at $\sim 10^{-17}$eV. Given the universality of its underlying physics, we expect DP polarimetry to be broadly applicable for DP detection in laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) constitute a paradigm in the search for particle dark matter. In contrast to supersymmetry (SUSY), we explore the possibility that WIMP dark-matter acts as mediator of neutrino mass generation. We examine in detail the phenomenology of fermionic dark matter in the revamped (or singlet-triplet) scotogenic model and study its collider implications. Unlike SUSY WIMP dark-matter, collider searches for the Lightest Scotogenic Particle (LSP) at LHC/LHC-HL are strongly complementary to charged lepton flavor violation probes and dark matter studies.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling $\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $ or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bound and resonant states of doubly heavy tetraquarks with spin $J\leq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a number of exotic hadrons have been reported in the experiments, and most of these states lie slightly below the threshold. Therefore, these states are considered to be hadronic molecules composed of mesons or baryons. In 2022, the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ was reported by the LHCb experiment, which is considered to be composed of two heavy quarks and two light antiquarks, and located slightly below the $DD^\ast$ threshold. The observation motivates us to study the bound and resonant states of the doubly heavy tetraquarks as two meson systems. We employ the one boson exchange potential as an interaction between two mesons, where one free parameter has been determined to reproduce $T_{cc}$ reported by the LHCb experiment. In our previous work, bound states of $D^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$ and $B^{(\ast)}B^{(\ast)}$ molecules were studied, where we respected the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQS). Using the same framework, we study not only bound but also resonant states with $J\leq 2$ in this paper. Furthermore, we discuss the HQS partner structures of $T_{cc}$ and $T_{bb}$ obtained in our study by introducing the light cloud basis.</description>

      <title>Dark Spin-2 Field Solitons as a Source of Electromagnetic Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-$s$ light dark boson particles can exhibit wave-like behavior, capable of forming long-lived, coherent, spatially localized structures known as solitons. This work considers the possibility that a light spin-2 particle might be part of or all the dark matter content of the Universe, which could result in a significant fraction of solitons existing today in galactic halos. If these dark matter particles interact with electromagnetism through dimension-6 operators, the solitons may experience parametric resonance of photons triggered by the surrounding electromagnetic field. We explore the feasibility and key characteristics of this electromagnetic radiation, as well as the potential for detection through soliton mergers using ground-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from string axion domain walls without cosmic strings, and DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 have shown a preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, consistent with previous analyses based on Planck and WMAP data. Separately, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results suggest that dark energy evolves over cosmic history, pointing to new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we propose that domain walls associated with the string axion can naturally explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence, focusing on the case in which the axion starts near a hilltop. Interestingly, to avoid the domain wall problem, these walls must form well after recombination. The predicted rotation angle, $\beta \approx 0.21\,c_\gamma$ degrees (with anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$), is in excellent agreement with observations. This scenario can be further tested by probing anisotropic birefringence of photons emitted long after recombination, as well as gravitational waves. Moreover, starting the axion oscillation from a hilltop naturally enhances its abundance via anharmonic effects, thus contributing to the dark energy component. We discuss how this hilltop axion scenario may connect with the DESI results.</description>

Abstract: In collider physics, experiments are often based on counting the numbers of events in bins of a histogram. We present a new way to build and analyze statistical models that describe these experiments, based on the probabilistic programming language Stan and the HistFactory specification. A command-line tool transpiles HistFactory models into Stan code and data files. Because Stan is an imperative language, it enables richer and more detailed modeling, as modeling choices defined in the HistFactory declarative specification can be tweaked and adapted in the Stan language. Stan was constructed with automatic differentiation, allowing modern computational algorithms for sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Almost general analysis of $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry perturbed by charged leptons and its testability by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generally analyze the $\mu - \tau$ reflection symmetry modified by small mixings of charged leptons and how will future experiments verify deviations from the predictions of the symmetry. As an approximation, the left-handed diagonalization $U_{e}$ of charged leptons is assumed to have a similar magnitude as the CKM matrix. In other words, the 1-3 mixing is neglected and the 1-2 and 2-3 mixing are to be approximately $O(0.1)$. The Dirac CP phase $\delta$ of the MNS matrix is evaluated in such parameter regions. As a result, deviations from the predictions $\sin \theta_{23} = \pi/4$ and $\delta = \pm \pi/2$ depend on relative CP phases between $U_{e}$ and diagonalization of neutrinos $U_{\nu}$. While phases of the second and third generations cause only about $\pm 10^{\circ}$ deviations for the Dirac phase $\delta$, the phase of the first generation can cause up to $\pm 30^{\circ}$. This flavor dependence is distinguished to some extent by the next-generation experiments. On the other hand, if $\delta$ is not observed, such a scenario is excluded by about 5 years of observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new solutions to accommodate both the MiniBooNE electron-like and MicroBooNE photon low-energy excesses, based on interactions involving light dark matter and/or neutrinos. The novelty of our proposal lies in the utilization of a photon arising from 2-to-3 scattering processes between a nucleus/nucleon and a neutrino and/or dark matter via exchanges of light mediators. We find that viable regions exist in the coupling and mass parameter space of the mediators and light dark matter that can simultaneously explain the observed excesses and remain consistent with current experimental constraints. We further highlight that these scenarios can be tested with upcoming data from various ongoing experiments.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the gluon propagator to be finite at $ g^{2}_{s} /4\pi \equiv \alpha \rightarrow \alpha_{\ast} $, where $ \alpha_{\ast} = \alpha (0) $, we derive its low-momentum asymptotics. In some cases the results modify the known ones. In our work, we also establish the field-theoretical nature of a universal phenomenological parameter introduced in works \cite{Alk} and determining the behaviour of Green's functions in the infrared region. The importance of studying the renormalization group parameters in the vicinity of the infrared stable point is emphasized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new topology for weakly supervised anomaly detection searches, di-object plus~X. In this topology, one looks for a resonance decaying to two standard model particles produced in association with other anomalous event activity (X). This additional activity is used for classification. We demonstrate how anomaly detection techniques which have been developed for di-jet searches focusing on jet substructure anomalies can be applied to event-level anomaly detection in this topology. To robustly capture event-level features of multi-particle kinematics, we employ new physically motivated variables derived from the geometric structure of a collision's phase space manifold. As a proof of concept, we explore the application of this approach to several benchmark signals in the di-$\tau$ and di-$\mu$ plus~X final states. We demonstrate that our anomaly detection approach can reach discovery-level significances for signals that would be missed in a conventional bump-hunt approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for neutrino magnetic moments offers a valuable window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, a common misconception arises in the interpretation of experimental results: the assumption that the so-called effective neutrino magnetic moment is a universal, experiment-independent quantity. In reality, this effective parameter depends on the specific characteristics of each experiment, including the neutrino source, flavor composition or energy spectrum. As a result, the effective magnetic moment derived from solar neutrino data differs fundamentally from that obtained in reactor or accelerator-based experiments. Treating these quantities as directly comparable can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we clarify the proper definition of the effective neutrino magnetic moment in various experimental contexts and discuss the implications of this misconception for global analyses and theoretical interpretations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Jet production at electron-positron colliders at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first application of antenna subtraction at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD by computing fully differential predictions for two-jet production at electron-positron colliders. We illustrate the structure of the infrared counterterms and provide results for the N$^3$LO correction to the two-jet production rate and to the leading-jet energy. Our work constitutes the first direct calculation of jet production at electron-positron colliders at N$^3$LO and represents the first step in tackling arbitrary processes with jets at this perturbative order.</description>

      <title>The nonleptonic decays $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$ within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nonleptonic decays $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$ with considering $\Xi_{c}-\Xi_{c}^{\prime}$ mixing. The relevant decay amplitudes are evaluated within the framework of nonrelativistic quark model, combining the baryon spatial wave functions adopted from solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic potential. With the mixing angle ranging $\theta\in(-18.2^{\circ},-14.3^{\circ})$, we successfully reproduce the measured ratio $R=\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]/\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]$ reported by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, we estimate the branching fractions as $\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]=(3.2\sim4.3)\%$ and $\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]=(4.2\sim6.0)\%$, and the asymmetry parameters as $\alpha[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]=(-0.80\sim-0.81)$ and $\alpha[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]=(-0.61\sim-0.62)$. The measurements of absolute branching fractions and asymmetry parameters by the ongoing LHCb and Belle II experiments will be helpful for further testing our numerical results and confirming the mixing angle.</description>

      <title>Chiral perturbation theory for baryon-number-violating nucleon decay into a vector meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [New chiral structures for baryon number violating nucleon decays, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14855}{arXiv:2504.14855}.] we identified generic baryon-number-violating (BNV) structures containing triple light quarks and achieved their leading-order chiral realizations involving octet pseudoscalars and baryons. Although many two-body nucleon decays into a vector meson have been experimentally searched for and stringently constrained, a consistent theoretical framework for their calculation is still lacking. In this Letter, we fill the gap by implementing chiral matching of all these triple-quark interactions onto hadronic interactions involving octet vector mesons, baryons, and pseudoscalars. This paves the way for a consistent and comprehensive study of all relevant BNV processes. As an illustration of application, we show how degeneracy in the parameter space of Wilson coefficients can be broken by synthesizing experimental constraints on nucleon decays into a vector or pseudoscalar meson when relevant hadronic low-energy constants can be reasonably determined.</description>

      <title>Closing in on singly charged scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate current experimental constraints and future search prospects for a hypothetical spin-zero particle that carries unit electric charge: a singly charged scalar (SCS). In addition to providing useful benchmarks for collider searches, SCS particles are also well-motivated ingredients in relatively minimal dark sectors. We focus on scenarios in which the SCS decays promptly at colliders to a lepton plus either a neutrino or an invisible dark-sector particle of negligible mass. A promptly decaying SCS can easily have appreciable branching ratios to more than one lepton flavor while remaining consistent with constraints on lepton flavor violation. This broadens the allowed range of SCS masses to extend well beyond those for right-handed selectrons, smuons, or staus. For particular benchmark SCS branching ratios, we find that SCS masses above ~185 GeV and in a lower-mass window ~80-125 GeV are still allowed at 95% confidence level. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to explore the potential of a boosted-decision-tree-based analysis to probe the surviving SCS parameter space in future searches at the (HL-)LHC, finding a significant increase in sensitivity relative to cut-based analyses both in the lower-mass window and at higher SCS masses.</description>

      <title>RG evolution and effect of intermediate new physics on $\Delta B=2$ six-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent identification of possible 11 neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\bar{n}$) oscillation candidate events at Super-Kamiokande has renewed the interest in $\Delta B = 2$ transitions. In this work, we analyze the Renormalization Group (RG) running of mass dimension-9 six-quark operators, in $\bar{MS}$ scheme, that generate processes like $nn\to \pi^0\pi^0$, deuteron decay, $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillations etc, evolving them from the electroweak scale to baryon number violating scale ($\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$). Our goal is to systematically account for the influence of potential new physics at intermediate energies ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10~ \text{TeV})$), especially given the fact that {\it Large Hadron Collider} has not ruled out new physics beyond $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$. To comprehensively investigate their influence, we consider two scenarios: (i) a minimal setup with only Standard Model degrees of freedom up to the high scale at $\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$, and (ii) an extended framework involving scalar and vector bosons above $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$ up till BNV scale. To facilitate further studies, we also provide a Python script that performs RG evolution of the BNV Wilson coefficients in the presence of generic bosonic new physics at any intermediate energy scale. It can be modified easily to meet the needs of the user to investigate the running of the BNV Wilson coefficients. We then compare the result with the experimental bound from the neutron-antineutron oscillation process and constrain the scale of baryon number violating new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in the study of radiative decays of charmed mesons, we investigate the magnetic (transition) moments of vector mesons by applying the effective mass scheme, obtained from the one-gluon exchange interaction between quark-antiquark pairs. By incorporating high-precision experimental data from both heavy and light flavor sectors, we accurately account for the strong hyperfine interaction contributions to the quark and antiquark masses within mesons. We calculate the $V \to P$ effective transition magnetic moments to reliably predict M1 decay widths. Furthermore, to enhance the completeness of our analysis, we employ the non-relativistic potential model to calculate bound state isomultiplet masses and to predict the M1 decay widths of charmed mesons. Additionally, scale-dependent effects in both the effective mass scheme and the potential model are systematically analyzed and interpreted, emphasizing the decisive role of higher-order QCD corrections in determining M1 decay widths.</description>

      <title>From Fluctuation to Polarization: Imprints of $O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ Curvature Perturbations in CMB B-modes from Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing primordial curvature perturbations on small scales, beyond those accessible using cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, remains a major open challenge. Current constraints on the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on model-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we propose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using scalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature perturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While induced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the stochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary observable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the CMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced scalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with inflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in upcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4. We map the region of the scalar power spectrum to which these future B-mode experiments will be sensitive and compare with existing constraints, finding it to exceed current sensitivities at $k \sim O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In addition to providing a new CMB-based probe of the small-scale power spectrum, this work also motivates dedicated B-mode searches at higher multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 100$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To identify first-order phase transitions in the dynamical process similar to the relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we investigate the dynamical behaviors of the first-order phase transition criterion in the Fokker-Planck framework. In the thermodynamic limit, the criterion can be expressed as combinations of cumulants or coefficients of an Ising-like effective potential. Our study reveals that factors such as phase transition scenarios, initial temperature, system volume, relaxation rate, and evolution trajectory have great impacts on the criterion, a larger initial temperature, a smaller volume, a larger relaxation rate, or bending of the trajectory will all lead to a reduction of the first-order phase transition signal, while volume expansion over time preserves signal integrity. Analysis along a hypothetical freezeout line shows that the signal is possibly preserved at relatively large chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Geminga: A Window into the Role Played by the Local Halo in the Cosmic-Ray Propagation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel phenomenon among the recently observed Geminga pulsar halo is the presence of distinct radiation morphology at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected in the 10-500 GeV energy band within a $40\degree\times40\degree$ region. This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-wavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) The slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region. (2) The incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic ray halo to further validate our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches, as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $\phi^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Emission and Plasma Heating from Primordial Black Holes: An Improved Approach to $N_\mathrm{eff}$ Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino emission via Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) on the cosmological effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, after neutrino decoupling. By comparing this effect with observational limits, we derive bounds on the abundance of light PBHs. Our analysis incorporates two previously unaccounted-for effects: the emission of secondary neutrinos from unstable particles, which increases $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and the modification of the neutrino-photon temperature ratio due to particle emission heating the photon plasma, which lowers $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Overall, including these effects allows us to impose constraints on PBHs with initial masses in the range $10^9~{\rm g}\lesssim M_{\rm ini} \lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$. However, our limits remain less stringent than those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of preheating in Higgs--$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the preheating dynamics and associated gravitational wave signatures in the Higgs--$R^2$ inflationary model. Using lattice simulations, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the system across the parameter space, covering both the Higgs-like and $R^2$-like scenarios. We demonstrate that the efficiency of preheating is significantly dependent on the nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi$. As the $\xi$ parameter increases, moving from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime, we observe more efficient preheating. Through detailed numerical computations, efficient preheating is shown to lead to stronger gravitational wave production. The amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum varies by several orders of magnitude as we move from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime. The resultant gravitational wave signatures can serve as a potential observational probe to distinguish between different parameter regimes of the Higgs--$R^2$ model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Primordial Black Hole Reheating in Upcoming Interferometry Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of detecting a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from the primordial black hole (PBH) reheating epoch. If PBHs form during a non-standard cosmological phase prior to the radiation-dominated era, they can dominate the energy density of the Universe before evaporating via Hawking radiation. Such PBHs can generate induced GWs that may fall within the detectable range of future interferometry missions: (i) through isocurvature perturbations arising from the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) through the amplification of adiabatic perturbations triggered by the abrupt transition from PBH domination to radiation domination. We assess the detection prospects of such GW spectra using the signal-to-noise ratio, Fisher forecast analysis, and Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with mock data from LISA and ET. Our findings reveal that ET exhibits superior sensitivity to both isocurvature- and adiabatic-induced GWs, covering a wide PBH mass range of $M_{\rm in} \in (0.5-4\times 10^7)$ g. However, we find that the relative uncertainties associated with the parameter of the isocurvature source are quite high. LISA, by contrast, is mostly sensitive to the adiabatic source, with $M_{\rm in} \in (2\times10^4-5\times 10^8)$ g. The combined effect of adiabatic and isocurvature sources on ET and LISA provides a multi-stage window into the post-inflationary Universe by constraining PBH mass, energy fraction, and the background equation of state.</description>

      <title>Learnable cut flow for high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance.

Abstract: We study coupling selection rules of chiral matter fields in heterotic string theory with standard embedding. These selection rules are determined by topological properties of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We classify coupling selection rules on complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. It is found that all of these selection rules for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$ are understood by combinations of only five types of fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTAO on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTAO to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTAO could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the well-studied genus zero case, bases of $\mathrm{d}\log$ integrands with integer leading singularities define Feynman integrals that automatically satisfy differential equations in canonical form. Such integrand bases can be constructed without input from the differential equations and without explicit involvement of dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$. We propose a generalization of this construction to genus one geometry arising from the appearance of elliptic curves. We argue that a particular choice of algebraic one-forms of the second kind that avoids derivatives is crucial. We observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equations that has not been previously reported, and that their solutions order by order in $\epsilon$ yield pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the implications of recent CMB observations for Higgs-Starobinsky inflationary models and their associated reheating dynamics, utilizing data from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. In addition to direct CMB constraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through limits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially relevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state $w_{\rm RH}\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of inflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the $2\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature is constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\rm RH} &gt; 0.41$. However, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\sigma$ C.L. once $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the Higgs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219</link>

Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Glauber predictions for oxygen and neon collisions at LHC</title>

Abstract: The Glauber model is a widely used framework for describing the initial conditions in high-energy nuclear collisions. TGlauberMC is a Monte Carlo implementation of this model that enables detailed, event-by-event calculations across various collision systems. In this work, we present an updated version of TGlauberMC (3.3), which incorporates recent theoretical developments and improved parameterizations, especially relevant for small collision systems. We focus on the oxygen-oxygen (OO), neon-neon (NeNe), and proton-oxygen (pO) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in July 2025, where precise modelling of nuclear geometry and fluctuations is essential. The updated version includes revised nuclear density profiles and an enhanced treatment of nucleon substructure. We calculate geometrical cross sections for all relevant collision systems and explore initial-state observables, providing predictions for particle production trends at $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}$=5.36 TeV. In particular, we present a prediction for the centrality dependence of mid-rapidity multiplicity in OO and NeNe collisions. The updated code is publicly available to support the heavy-ion community with a robust and flexible tool for studying strongly interacting matter in small and intermediate-sized nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</description>

      <title>Pair production of massive charged vector bosons from the worldline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a worldline formulation for a massive spin-1 particle interacting with an electromagnetic background. Two first-quantized descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom are considered: one based on bosonic oscillators and the other on fermionic oscillators. Focusing initially on the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer spin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via Dirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory. We then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate that Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition for the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this result, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to construct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged spin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian for a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson. As expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by deriving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous results obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the analysis using the standard $\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which contains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results. Finally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include effective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair production.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-M{\o}ller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.</description>
