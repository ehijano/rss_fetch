      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques have found widespread application across diverse fields. The rapid evolution of MCDM has led to the development of hundreds of methods, each employing distinct approaches. However, due to inherent algorithmic differences, various MCDM methods often yield divergent results when applied to the same specific problem. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of four particular methods: RAM, MOORA, FUCA, and CURLI, within a defined case study. The evaluation context involves ranking 30 Vietnamese banks based on six criteria: capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings ability, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. Prior to this analysis, these banks had also been ranked by the CAMELS rating system. The CAMELS rankings serve as a benchmark to assess the performance of the RAM, MOORA, FUCA, and CURLI methods. Our findings indicate that FUCA and CURLI are highly suitable methods for this application, demonstrating Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with CAMELS of 0.9996 and 0.9984, respectively. In contrast, both RAM and MOORA proved unsuitable, exhibiting very low Spearman's correlation coefficients of -1.0296 against the CAMELS ranking.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methodologies for Ranking Alternatives: A case study in assessing bank financial performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bank financial performance encapsulates an institution's capacity to effectively manage its assets, capital, and operational activities to generate profits and ensure stability. Evaluating this performance necessitates the integration of diverse metrics, including profitability indicators, loan growth rates, capital utilization efficiency, and more. Nevertheless, directly comparing the financial performance across different banks presents a complex challenge due to inherent disparities in their specific performance parameters. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are frequently employed to navigate this intricate assessment. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of various MCDM approaches in evaluating bank financial performance. Our investigation encompasses both a comparison of methods for assigning weights to criteria and a comparison of methodologies for ranking the alternatives (banks). We examine five distinct weighting methods: Equal, Entropy, MEREC, LOPCOW, and SPC. Concurrently, three alternative ranking methods Probability, TOPSIS, and RAM are compared. These comparisons are conducted within the context of a case study involving the performance assessment of 19 banks. The findings indicate that the highest degree of stability in ranking bank financial performance is achieved when the Entropy method is utilized for criteria weighting in conjunction with the Probability method for ranking alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An informal and elementary introduction to probability scoring and forecast verification and improvement, slightly extended from Significance 22:3(2025)16, which might be useful for less mathematical readers as a prologue to the classic review by Gneiting and Raftery [Strictly proper scoring rules, prediction, and estimation, Journal of the American Statistical Association 102 (2007): 359].</description>

      <title>Chaotic Bayesian Inference: Strange Attractors as Risk Models for Black Swan Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new risk modeling framework where chaotic attractors shape the geometry of Bayesian inference. By combining heavy-tailed priors with Lorenz and Rossler dynamics, the models naturally generate volatility clustering, fat tails, and extreme events. We compare two complementary approaches: Model A, which emphasizes geometric stability, and Model B, which highlights rare bursts using Fibonacci diagnostics. Together, they provide a dual perspective for systemic risk analysis, linking Black Swan theory to practical tools for stress testing and volatility monitoring.</description>
