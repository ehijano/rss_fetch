      <title>Generation of high-power attosecond x-ray FEL pulses carrying orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), are emerging as a powerful tool to probe matter. Recently, a method called self-seeded FEL with OAM (SSOAM) has been proposed to generate high-power x-ray OAM pulses, which places the traditional optical elements in the linear regime of the FEL amplification process before saturation to reduce the thermal load of the optical element. In this work, we propose to utilize the SSOAM scheme to produce attosecond x-ray vortices with high intensity. Numerical simulations demonstrate the x-ray OAM pulses with peak powers of more than one hundred gigawatts and a pulse duration of the order of hundred attoseconds can be achieved using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>AttoSHINE: Generation of continuous-wave terawatt-scale attosecond X-ray pulses at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Self-seeded photon acceleration by electron beam-driven transition radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon acceleration (PA) driven by ultra-relativistic electron beams offers a promising approach to generating high-power, high-frequency coherent radiation sources. While current methods typically rely on external optical laser pulses injected into beam-driven plasma wakefields, they face significant challenges in synchronization and alignment between electron accelerators and laser systems. We propose utilizing transition radiation (TR) generated by the drive electron bunch transversing the vacuum-gas interface as the seed photons of PA. Using a 1 GeV electron bunch, we demonstrate acceleration of TR from 4.4 {\mu}m to 184 nm in 1.6 mm of two-stage uniform plasma, achieving more than a 20-fold frequency boost. Further frequency increases can be achieved with optimized setups. This scheme addresses the synchronization and alignment issues present in previous approaches, providing a practical path toward beam-driven photon acceleration.</description>

      <title>An analytical optimization of plasma density profiles for downramp injection in laser wake-field acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and detail a multi-step analytical procedure, based on an improved fully relativistic plane model for Laser Wake Field Acceleration, to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile, so as to control and optimize the partial wave-breaking of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first wave-breaking at the density down-ramp, at least in the first stages of their acceleration phase. We find an excellent agreement with the results of Particle In Cell simulations obtained with the same input data.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of attosecond hard X-ray pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first direct experimental confirmation of attosecond pulse generation in the hard X-ray regime with a free-electron laser. Our experiment is based on measurements of a nonlinear optical phenomenon known as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from 3d transition metals. By analyzing the yield of the collective X-ray fluorescence induced by ultrashort pulses at the Linac Coherent Light Source, we identify the generation of attosecond pulses and shot-to-shot fluctuations in their duration, ranging from 100 as to 400 as. The observed product of bandwidth and pulse duration for 100 as pulses is approximately 2 fs$\cdot$eV, indicating the generation of nearly transform-limited pulses. Our results extend the photon energy reach of attosecond techniques by one order of magnitude, providing the ability to simultaneously probe matter on the time-scales of electronic phenomena and with atomic spatial resolution. Furthermore, attosecond hard X-ray pulses can outrun the fastest radiation damage processes, paving the way to single-shot damage-free X-ray measurements.</description>
