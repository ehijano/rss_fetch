      <title>New Perspectives in Online Contract Design: Heterogeneous, Homogeneous, Non-myopic Agents and Team Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the repeated principal-agent problem from an online learning perspective. The principal's goal is to learn the optimal contract that maximizes her utility through repeated interactions, without prior knowledge of the agent's type (i.e., the agent's cost and production functions).
  I study three different settings when the principal contracts with a $\textit{single}$ agent each round: 1. The agents are heterogeneous; 2. the agents are homogenous; 3. the principal interacts with the same agent and the agent is non-myopic. I present different approaches and techniques for designing learning algorithms in each setting. For heterogeneous agent types, I identify a condition that allows the problem to be reduced to Lipschitz bandits directly. For identical agents, I give a polynomial sample complexity scheme to learn the optimal contract based on inverse game theory. For strategic non-myopic agents, I design a low strategic-regret mechanism. Also, I identify a connection between linear contracts and posted-price auctions, showing the two can be reduced to one another, and give a regret lower bound on learning the optimal linear contract based on this observation.
  I also study a $\textit{team production}$ model. I identify a condition under which the principal's learning problem can be reformulated as solving a family of convex programs, thereby showing the optimal contract can be found efficiently.</description>

      <title>Controlling Delegations in Liquid Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In liquid democracy, agents can either vote directly or delegate their vote to a different agent of their choice. This results in a power structure in which certain agents possess more voting weight than others. As a result, it opens up certain possibilities of vote manipulation, including control and bribery, that do not exist in standard voting scenarios of direct democracy. Here we formalize a certain kind of election control -- in which an external agent may change certain delegation arcs -- and study the computational complexity of the corresponding combinatorial problem.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of multi-agent learning systems at the interface of game theory and artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two fields that, at first glance, might seem distinct, but they have notable connections and intersections. The former focuses on the evolution of behaviors (or strategies) in a population, where individuals interact with others and update their strategies based on imitation (or social learning). The more successful a strategy is, the more prevalent it becomes over time. The latter, meanwhile, is centered on machine learning algorithms and (deep) neural networks. It is often from a single-agent perspective but increasingly involves multi-agent environments, in which intelligent agents adjust their strategies based on feedback and experience, somewhat akin to the evolutionary process yet distinct in their self-learning capacities. In light of the key components necessary to address real-world problems, including (i) learning and adaptation, (ii) cooperation and competition, (iii) robustness and stability, and altogether (iv) population dynamics of individual agents whose strategies evolve, the cross-fertilization of ideas between both fields will contribute to the advancement of mathematics of multi-agent learning systems, in particular, to the nascent domain of ``collective cooperative intelligence'' bridging evolutionary dynamics and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling: Improved Convergence for Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for solving finite-sum min-max optimization and variational inequality problems (VIPs) appearing in various machine learning tasks. However, existing convergence analyses of SEG focus on its with-replacement variants, while practical implementations of the method randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them. Unlike the well-studied with-replacement variants, SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) lacks established theoretical guarantees. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of SEG-RR for three classes of VIPs: (i) strongly monotone, (ii) affine, and (iii) monotone. We derive conditions under which SEG-RR achieves a faster convergence rate than the uniform with-replacement sampling SEG. In the monotone setting, our analysis of SEG-RR guarantees convergence to an arbitrary accuracy without large batch sizes, a strong requirement needed in the classical with-replacement SEG. As a byproduct of our results, we provide convergence guarantees for Shuffle Once SEG (shuffles the data only at the beginning of the algorithm) and the Incremental Extragradient (does not shuffle the data). We supplement our analysis with experiments validating empirically the superior performance of SEG-RR over the classical with-replacement sampling SEG.</description>

      <title>Equitable Pricing in Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how pricing affects the division of surplus among buyers in auctions for multiple units. Our equity objective may be important, e.g., for competition concerns in downstream markets, complementing the long-standing debate on revenue and efficiency. We study a canonical model of auctions for multiple indivisible units with unit demand buyers and valuations with a private and a common component and consider all pricing rules that are a mixture (i.e., a convex combination) of pay-as-bid and uniform pricing. We propose the winners' empirical variance (WEV), the expected empirical variance of surplus among the winners, as a metric for surplus equity. We show that, for a range of private-common value proportions, a strictly interior mix of pay-as-bid and uniform pricing minimizes WEV. From an equity perspective, auctions with a higher private value component benefit from more price discrimination, whereas only auctions with a sufficiently high common value justify a more uniform pricing rule. We provide a criterion under which strictly mixed pricing dominates uniform pricing, a partial ranking of different mixed pricing formats, and bounds on the WEV-minimizing pricing under the assumption of log-concave signal distributions. In numerical experiments, we further illustrate the WEV-minimal pricing as a function of the private-common-value mix.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Reactive Strategies Resilient to Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare games under delayed control and delay games, two types of infinite games modelling asynchronicity in reactive synthesis. In games under delayed control both players suffer from partial informedness due to symmetrically delayed communication, while in delay games, the protagonist has to grant lookahead to the alter player. Our first main result, the interreducibility of the existence of sure winning strategies for the protagonist, allows to transfer known complexity results and bounds on the delay from delay games to games under delayed control, for which no such results had been known. We furthermore analyse existence of randomized strategies that win almost surely, where this correspondence between the two types of games breaks down. In this setting, some games surely won by the alter player in delay games can now be won almost surely by the protagonist in the corresponding game under delayed control, showing that it indeed makes a difference whether the protagonist has to grant lookahead or both players suffer from partial informedness. These results get even more pronounced when we finally address the quantitative goal of winning with a probability in $[0,1]$. We show that for any rational threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$ there is a game that can be won by the protagonist with exactly probability $\theta$ under delayed control, while being surely won by alter in the delay game setting. All these findings refine our original result that games under delayed control are not determined.</description>

      <title>Bidding efficiently in Simultaneous Ascending Auctions with budget and eligibility constraints using Simultaneous Move Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, Simultaneous Ascending Auction (SAA) has been the most popular mechanism used for spectrum auctions. It has recently been employed by many countries for the allocation of 5G licences. Although SAA presents relatively simple rules, it induces a complex strategic game for which the optimal bidding strategy is unknown. Considering the fact that sometimes billions of euros are at stake in an SAA, establishing an efficient bidding strategy is crucial. In this work, we model the auction as a $n$-player simultaneous move game with complete information and propose the first efficient bidding algorithm that tackles simultaneously its four main strategic issues: the $\textit{exposure problem}$, the $\textit{own price effect}$, $\textit{budget constraints}$ and the $\textit{eligibility management problem}$. Our solution, called $SMS^\alpha$, is based on Simultaneous Move Monte Carlo Tree Search (SM-MCTS) and relies on a new method for the prediction of closing prices. By introducing a new reward function in $SMS^\alpha$, we give the possibility to bidders to define their own level of risk-aversion. Through extensive numerical experiments on instances of realistic size, we show that $SMS^\alpha$ largely outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, notably by achieving higher expected utility while taking less risks.</description>

      <title>TSO Games -- On the decidability of safety games under the total store order semantics (extended LMCS version with appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the classical Total Store Order (TSO) semantics by expanding it to turn-based 2-player safety games. During her turn, a player can select any of the communicating processes and perform its next transition. We consider different formulations of the safety game problem depending on whether one player or both of them transfer messages from the process buffers to the shared memory. We give the complete decidability picture for all the possible alternatives.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning with Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of deep learning, federated learning (FL) presents a promising approach that allows multi-institutional data owners, or clients, to collaboratively train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. However, most existing FL approaches rely on a centralized server for global model aggregation, leading to a single point of failure. This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that our framework is robust against malicious client-side behaviors.</description>
