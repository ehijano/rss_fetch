      <title>Quantum Annealing based Hybrid Strategies for Real Time Route Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most well-known problems in transportation and logistics is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). It involves optimizing a set of truck routes to service a set of customers, subject to limits on truck capacity, to reduce travel costs. The biggest challenge faced whilst attempting to solve the issue is that the time complexity of the issue grows exponentially with the number of customers and trucks, rendering it virtually intractable to traditional computers and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation, employing quantum computers to aid classical computers in solving problems faster while reducing complexity. To obtain our results, we employ two algorithms: Hybrid Two Step (H2S) and Hybrid Three Step (H3S). Both algorithms involve two phases: clustering and routing. It has been observed that both algorithms produce promising results, both in terms of solution time and solution cost.</description>

      <title>From dynamical to steady-state many-body metrology: Precision limits and their attainability with two-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body interactions enhance its $\theta$-sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the Quantum Fisher Information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding $\theta$: (i) via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii) in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (time-averaged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comment on 'Experimentally adjudicating between different causal accounts of Bell-inequality violations via statistical model selection'"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our article described an experiment that adjudicates between different causal accounts of Bell inequality violations by a comparison of their predictive power, finding that certain types of models that are structurally radical but parametrically conservative, of which a class of superdeterministic models are an example, overfit the data relative to models that are structurally conservative but parametrically radical in the sense of endorsing an intrinsically quantum generalization of the framework of causal modelling. In their comment (arXiv:2206.10619), Hance and Hossenfelder argue that we have misrepresented the purpose of superdeterministic models. We here dispute this claim by recalling the different classes of superdeterministic models we defined in our article and our conclusions regarding which of these are disfavoured by our experimental results. Their confusion on this point seems to have arisen in part from the fact that we characterized superdeterministic models within a causal modelling framework and from the fact that we referred to this framework as "classical" in order to contrast it with an intrinsically quantum alternative. In this reply, therefore, we take the opportunity to clarify these points. They also claim that if one is adjudicating between a pair of models, where one model can account for strictly more operational statistics than the other, the first model will tend to overfit the data relative to the second. Because this model inclusion relation can arise for pairs of models in a reductionist heirarchy, they conclude that overfitting should not be taken as evidence against the first model. We point out here that, contrary to this claim, one does not expect overfitting to arise generically in cases of model inclusion, so that it is indeed sometimes appropriate to consider overfitting as a criterion for adjudicating between such models.</description>

      <title>SymBreak: Mitigating Quantum Degeneracy Issues in QLDPC Code Decoders by Breaking Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for scalable and reliable quantum computing, but existing solutions, such as surface codes, incur significant qubit overhead. Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes have recently emerged as a promising alternative, requiring fewer qubits. However, the lack of efficient decoders remains a major barrier to their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce SymBreak, a novel decoder for qLDPC codes that adaptively modifies the decoding graph to improve the performance of state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders. Our key contribution is identifying quantum degeneracy as a root cause of the convergence issues often encountered in BP decoding of quantum LDPC codes. We propose a solution that mitigates this issue at the decoding graph level, achieving both fast and accurate decoding. Our results demonstrate that SymBreak outperforms BP and BP+OSD-a more complex variant of BP-with a $16.17\times$ reduction in logical error rate compared to BP and $3.23\times$ compared to BP+OSD across various qLDPC code families. With only an $18.97$% time overhead compared to BP, SymBreak provides significantly faster decoding times than BP+OSD, representing a major advancement in efficient and accurate decoding for qLDPC-based QEC architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensitivity of parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum systems exhibit high sensitivity to their initial conditions, where microscopic quantum fluctuations can significantly influence macroscopic observables. Understanding how quantum states may influence the behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems may open new avenues in controlling light-matter interactions. To explore this issue, we analyze the sensitivity of a fundamental quantum optical process - parametric oscillation - to quantum initializations. Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the "quantum sensitivity" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits. Our work opens the way to a new class of experiments that can test the sensitivity of macroscopic systems to quantum initial conditions and offers a pathway for controlling systems with quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Loss tolerant cross-Kerr enhancement via modulated squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop squeezing protocols to enhance cross-Kerr interactions. We show that through alternating between squeezing along different quadratures of a single photonic mode, the cross-Kerr interaction strength can be generically amplified. As an application of the squeezing protocols we discuss speeding up the deterministic implementation of controlled phase gates in photonic quantum computing architectures. We develop bounds that characterize how fast and strong single-mode squeezing has to be applied to achieve a desired gate error and show that the protocols can overcome photon losses. Finally, we discuss experimental realizations of the squeezing strategies in optical fibers and nanophotonic waveguides.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Semiclassical Rabi model: An analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric semiclassical Rabi model elucidates the fundamental interaction between a two-level atom and a classical field, exploring novel phenomena within open systems through the inclusion of non-Hermitian terms. We propose a single similarity transformation that yields an effective Hamiltonian in the form of the rotating-wave approximation, allowing the model to be solved analytically. The phase boundary of the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, obtained from the analytical eigenvalues, agrees well with the numerically exact one in a wide range of atomic frequencies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the analytical approach, particularly at the main resonance. The Floquet parity operator is also uncovered, providing a more physical understanding of the emergence of the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase. Furthermore, by analyzing the dynamics of excited state population, we find several stable oscillations within the Fourier analysis, demonstrating the applicability of the present analytical method beyond the single-photon resonance region. The present analytical treatment can concisely and accurately describe the main physics of this non-Hermitian atom-field interaction system.</description>

      <title>Fast and Tunable Decoherence-Free Subspace Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose schemes to design and control a time-dependent decoherence-free subspace (DFS) in a dissipative atom-cavity system. These schemes use atoms with three internal energy levels, which allows for the DFS to be multi-dimensional--a condition important for quantum sensing, simulation, and computation. We consider the use of tunable external driving lasers to transfer the system from a coherent spin state to a highly degenerate DFS. We find that the typical state in the DFS is highly entangled. Throughout evolution the state is kept in an instantaneous DFS, thereby allowing for pure states to be prepared. We develop adiabatic shortcuts to carry out this evolution with higher purity and fidelity than standard adiabatic and dissipative methods.</description>

      <title>Passive polarization-encoded BB84 protocol using a heralded single-photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BB84 quantum key distribution protocol set the foundation for achieving secure quantum communication. Since its inception, significant advancements have aimed to overcome experimental challenges and enhance security. In this paper, we report the implementation of a passive polarization-encoded BB84 protocol using a heralded single-photon source. By passively and randomly encoding polarization states with beam splitters and half-wave plates, the setup avoids active modulation, simplifying design and enhancing security against side-channel attacks. The heralded single-photon source ensures a low probability of multi-photon emissions, eliminating the need for decoy states and mitigating photon number splitting vulnerabilities. The quality of the single-photon source is certified by measuring the second-order correlation function at zero delay, $g^{2}(0)=0.0408\pm0.0008$, confirming a very low probability of multi-photon events. Compared to conventional BB84 or BBM92 protocols, our protocol provides optimized resource trade-offs, with fewer detectors (compared to BBM92) and no reliance on external quantum random number generators (compared to typical BB84) to drive Alice's encoding scheme. Our implementation achieved a quantum bit error rate of 7% and a secure key rate of 5 kbps. These results underscore the practical, secure, and resource-efficient framework our protocol offers for scalable quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum classifiers via a programmable photonic microprocessor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds promise across various fields, particularly with the advent of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which can outperform classical supercomputers in specific tasks. However, challenges such as noise and limited qubit capabilities hinder its practical applications. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer a viable strategy to achieve quantum advantage by combining quantum and classical computing. Leveraging on VQAs, the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) is competitive with many classical classifiers. This work implements a VQC using a silicon-based quantum photonic microprocessor and a classical computer, demonstrating its effectiveness in nonlinear binary and multi-classification tasks. An efficient gradient free genetic algorithm is employed for training. The VQC's performance was evaluated on three synthetic binary classification tasks with square-, circular-, and sine-shape decision boundaries and a real-world multiclass Iris dataset. The accuracies on the three binary classification tasks were 87.5%, 92.5%, and 85.0%, respectively, and 98.8% on the real world Iris dataset, highlighting the platform's potential to handle complex data patterns.</description>

      <title>Generalized coherent states for the harmonic oscillator by the J-matrix method with an extension to the Morse potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02958v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dealing with the J-Matrix method for the harmonic oscillator to write down its tridiagonal matrix representation in an orthonormal basis of L2(R); we rederive a set of generalized coherent states (GCS) of Perelomov type labeled by points z of the complex plane C and depending on a positive integer number m The number states expansion of these GCS gives rise to coefficients that are complex Hermite polynomials whose linear superpositions provide eigenfunctions for the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian associated with the mth Landau level. We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new set of GCS of Glauber type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy in Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of an observer-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum level by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy formula to incorporate contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We demonstrate this framework with the computation of the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved spaces. Our work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to establish a foundation for studying quantum information in continuous and curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Birthmarks: Ergodicity Breaking Beyond Quantum Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One manifestation of classical ergodicity is a complete loss of memory of the initial conditions due to the eventual uniform exploration of phase space. In quantum versions of the same systems, classical ergodic traits can be broken. Here, we extend the concept of quantum scars in new directions, more focused on ergodicity and infinite time averages than individual eigenstates. We specifically establish a union of short and long-term enhancements in terms of a \emph{quantum birthmark} (QB). Subsequently, we show (1) that the birth and early evolution of a nonstationary state is remembered forever in infinite time averages, and (2) that early recurrences in the autocorrelation function inevitably lead to nonergodic flow over infinite times. We recount here that phase space cannot be explored ergodically if there are early recurrences (well before the Heisenberg time) in the autocorrelation of the initial nonstationary quantum state. Employing random matrix theory, we show that QB extends beyond individual states to entire subspaces or ``{\it birthplaces}" in Hilbert space. Finally, we visualize scar-amplified QBs unveiled within the time-averaged probability density of a wavepacket in a stadium system. By transcending the quantum scarring, QB delivers a new paradigm for understanding the elusive quantum nature of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Universal distributed blind quantum computing with solid-state qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a promising application of distributed quantum systems, where a client can perform computations on a remote server without revealing any details of the applied circuit. While the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter qubit platforms, implementing BQC on matter qubits remains an outstanding challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we experimentally demonstrate a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we perform a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, paving the way towards blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures.</description>

      <title>Entangling independent particles by path identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement -- correlations of particles that are stronger than any classical analogue -- is the basis for research on the foundations of quantum mechanics and for practical applications such as quantum networks. Traditionally, entanglement is achieved through local interactions or via entanglement swapping, where entanglement at a distance is generated through previously established entanglement and Bell-state measurements. However, the precise requirements enabling the generation of quantum entanglement without traditional local interactions remain less explored. Here we demonstrate that independent particles can be entangled without the need for direct interaction, prior established entanglement, or Bell-state measurements, by exploiting the indistinguishability of the origins of photon pairs. Our demonstrations challenge the long-standing belief that the prior generation and measurement of entanglement are necessary prerequisites for generating entanglement between independent particles that do not share a common past. In addition to its foundational interest, we show that this technique might lower the resource requirements in quantum networks, by reducing the complexity of photon sources and the overhead photon numbers.</description>

      <title>Single photonic qutrit in a collective Rydberg polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the coherent creation, control and read-out of a single photonic qutrit in a Rydberg ensemble. In each measurement, an optical photon is stored as a Rydberg polariton through electromagnetically induced transparency. Employing two microwave fields, the polariton is driven into an arbitrary superposition of three collective states, each encoded in a Rydberg state. The collective state is mapped into a photonic time-bin qutrit with the microwave field and read out sequentially. The complete sequence, including preparation, control, and read-out, is less than 1.8~$\mu$s, which mitigates decoherence significantly. We measure the coherence of the qutrit with non-destructive Ramsey interferometry, which is preferable for quantum information processing, and find good quantitative agreement with the theoretical model. The ability to write, process and read out the single photonic qutrit on microsecond time scales with microwave coupled Rydberg states demonstrates the coherent connectivity among the high Hilbert space of the qutrit.Our study is an important step in exploring qutrit based quantum information processes and quantum simulation of topological physics with microwave coupled Rydberg atom ensembles.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Neural Network for Approximate SRBB-Based Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, scalable quantum neural networks are introduced to approximate unitary evolutions through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a reduced number of CNOTs. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the recursive algorithm that builds the SRBB is presented, framed in the original scalability scheme already known to the literature only from a theoretical point of view. Unexpectedly, 2-qubit systems emerge as a special case outside this scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm to reduce the number of CNOTs is proposed, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires one single layer of approximation. From the mathematical algorithm, the scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate SRBB-based synthesis algorithm with CNOT-reduction is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Pauli quantum computing: $I$ as $|0\rangle$ and $X$ as $|1\rangle$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new quantum computing formalism named Pauli quantum computing. In this formalism, we use the Pauli basis $I$ and $X$ on the non-diagonal blocks of density matrices to encode information and treat them as the computational basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ in standard quantum computing. There are significant differences between Pauli quantum computing and standard quantum computing from the achievable operations to the meaning of measurements, resulting in novel features and comparative advantages for certain tasks. We will give three examples in particular. First, we show how to design Lindbladians to realize imaginary time evolutions and prepare stabilizer ground states in Pauli quantum computing. These stabilizer states can characterize the coherence in the steady subspace of Lindbladians. Second, for quantum amplitudes of the form $\langle +|^{\otimes n}U|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ with $U$ composed of $\{H,S,T,\text{CNOT}\}$, as long as the number of Hadamard gates in the unitary circuit $U$ is sub-linear $\mathit{o}(n)$, the gate (time) complexity of estimating such amplitudes using Pauli quantum computing formalism can be exponentially reduced compared with the standard formalism ($\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(2^{-(n-\mathit{o}(n))/2}\epsilon^{-1})$). Third, given access to a searching oracle under the Pauli encoding picture manifested as a quantum channel, which mimics the phase oracle in Grover's algorithm, the searching problem can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ scaling for the query complexity and $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ scaling for the time complexity. While so, how to construct such an oracle is highly non-trivial and unlikely efficient due to the hardness of the problem.</description>

      <title>LEP-QNN: Loan Eligibility Prediction Using Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting loan eligibility with high accuracy remains a significant challenge in the finance sector. Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the high-dimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN).Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98% in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEP-QNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of trained quantum neural networks to a Gaussian process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726], it is proven that the probability distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance. This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime, \emph{i.e.}, each parameter changes only by a small amount. While the convergence result of [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726] holds at a fixed training time, our upper bounds are uniform in time and hold even as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a device-independent dimensionality test with bipartite measurements and input from two separate parties, based on a null witness. The dimension is determined from the rank of the matrix of measurements for pairs of states prepared by the parties. We have applied the test to various IBM Quantum devices. The results demonstrate extreme precision of the test, which is able to detect disagreements with the qubit (two-level) space of bipartite measurement even in the presence of technical imperfections. The deviations beyond 6 standard deviations have no simple origin and need urgent explanations to unblock progress in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical binding refers to the light-induced interaction between two or more objects illuminated by laser fields. The high tunability of the strength, sign, and reciprocity of this interaction renders it highly attractive for controlling nanoscale mechanical motion. Here, we discuss the quantum theory of optical binding and identify unique signatures of this interaction in the quantum regime. We show that these signatures are observable in near-future experiments with levitated nanoparticles. In addition, we prove the impossibility of entanglement induced by far-field optical binding in free space and identify strategies to circumvent this no-go theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using monolithic photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can accelerate their adoption by a wide range of markets, thanks to the potential reduction in size, complexity of the overall system, power consumption, and production cost. In this work, we design, fabricate and characterize an InP-based PIC transmitter for continuous-variable (CV) QKD applications. In a proof-of-principle experiment implementing a pulsed Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) CV-QKD protocol over an optical fiber channel of 11 km, the system showed a performance compatible with a secret key rate of 78 kbps in the asymptotic regime. These results show the potential of InP technologies to integrate CV-QKD systems onto a monolithic platform.</description>

      <title>Directly measured squeeze factors over GHz bandwidth from monolithic ppKTP resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum states of light with bandwidths in the gigahertz range are required for ultrafast quantum sensors, for high-bandwidth QKD and for optical quantum computers. Here we present squeeze factors of monolithic periodically poled KTP (ppKTP) resonators measured with two laboratory-built balanced homodyne detectors with gigahertz bandwidth. We realise two complete systems without selection of optical or electronic hardware components to test the reproducibility without rejects. As expected, the systems show clear spectral differences. However, both achieve directly measured squeeze factors in the order of 3 dB over a GHz bandwidth, which is achieved here for the first time. Our direct measurement of quantum correlation is suitable for increasing the key rate of one-sided, device-independent QKD.</description>

      <title>Building Europe's first space-based Quantum Key Distribution system -- The German Aerospace Center's role in the EAGLE-1 mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EAGLE-1 mission aims to develop Europe's first sovereign, end-to-end space-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system. The mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA) and SES in collaboration with several European National Space Agencies and private partners. The state-of-the-art QKD system will consist of a payload on board the EAGLE-1 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite, optical ground stations, quantum operational networks, and key management system. The EAGLE-1 mission represents a major step for next-generation quantum communication infrastructures, delivering valuable technical results and mission data. The Institute of Communications and Navigation (IKN) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is a key partner in the EAGLE-1 mission and is involved in the research and development of elements in both space and ground segments. Here we report on the development of the QKD transmitter, a vital part of the QKD payload, and the customization of the Optical Ground Station Oberpfaffenhofen (OGS-OP) to conduct the IOT phase of EAGLE-1. For the space segment, DLR-IKN is in charge of the design of the QKD transmitter, including the development of the software and firmware. This transmitter generates quantum states which are used to implement a QKD protocol based on an optical signal, that will be transmitted to ground. For the ground segment, The OGS-OP will serve as the in-orbit testing ground station for EAGLE-1. Building upon the expertise with a range of satellites for quantum communication, as well as new implementations, OGS-OP will validate the performance of the payload, optical link and QKD system for the first time. We present the main developments of OGS-OP for the mission, which includes the implementation of an upgraded adaptive optics system to correct for atmospheric distortions and optimize the coupling of the incoming light into a single mode optical fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy extraction from a measured quantum system is a cornerstone of information thermodynamics as illustrated by Maxwell's demon. The nonequilibrium physics of many-particle systems is additionally strongly influenced by quantum statistics. We here report the first experimental realization of a quantum demon in a many-particle photonic setup made of two identical thermal light beams. We show that single-photon measurements combined with feedforward operation may deterministically increase the mean energy of one beam faster than energy fluctuations, thus improving the thermodynamic stability of the device. We moreover demonstrate that bosonic statistics can enhance the energy output above the classical limit, and further analyze the counterintuitive thermodynamics of the demon using an information-theoretic approach. Our results underscore the pivotal role of many-particle statistics for enhanced energy extraction in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>MLQM: Machine Learning Approach for Accelerating Optimal Qubit Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit mapping is a critical process in quantum computing that involves adapting logical quantum circuits to adhere to hardware constraints, thereby generating physically executable quantum circuits. Current quantum circuit mapping techniques, such as solver-based methods, often encounter challenges related to slow solving speeds due to factors like redundant search iterations. Regarding this issue, we propose a machine learning approach for accelerating optimal qubit mapping (MLQM). First, the method proposes a global search space pruning scheme based on prior knowledge and machine learning, which in turn improves the solution efficiency. Second, to address the limited availability of effective samples in the learning task, MLQM introduces a novel data augmentation and refinement scheme, this scheme enhances the size and diversity of the quantum circuit dataset by exploiting gate allocation and qubit rearrangement. Finally, MLQM also further improves the solution efficiency by pruning the local search space, which is achieved through an adaptive dynamic adjustment mechanism of the solver variables. Compared to state-of-the-art qubit mapping approaches, MLQM achieves optimal qubit mapping with an average solving speed-up ratio of 1.79 and demonstrates an average advantage of 22% in terms of space complexity.</description>

      <title>Diverse methods and practical aspects in controlling single semiconductor qubits: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control allows a wide range of quantum operations employed in molecular physics, nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum information processing. Thanks to the existing microelectronics industry, semiconducting qubits, where quantum information is encoded in spin or charge degree freedom of electrons or nuclei in semiconductor quantum dots, constitute a highly competitive candidate for scalable solid-state quantum technologies. In quantum information processing, advanced control techniques are needed to realize quantum manipulations with both high precision and noise resilience. In this review, we first introduce the basics of various widely-used control methods, including resonant excitation, adabatic passage, shortcuts to adiabaticity, composite pulses, and quantum optimal control. Then we review the practical aspects in applying these methods to realize accurate and robust quantum gates for single semiconductor qubits, such as Loss-DiVincenzo spin qubit, spinglet-triplet qubit, exchange-only qubit and charge qubit.</description>

Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous ponderomotive squeezing of light by two mechanical modes in an optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a source of squeezed light featuring simultaneous ponderomotive squeezing from two mechanical modes of an optomechanical system. We use ultra-coherent vibrational modes ($Q$ factors on the order of $10^{8}$) of a soft-clamped membrane placed in a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity at cryogenic conditions ($T=11\,\mathrm{K}$) and driven by quantum fluctuations in the intensity of light to create correlations between amplitude and phase quadratures of the intra-cavity light field. Continuous optical monitoring was conducted on two different mechanical modes with a frequency separation of around $1\,\mathrm{MHz}$. As a result of the interaction between the membrane position and the light, we generated ponderomotive squeezing of $4.8\,\mathrm{dB}$ for the first localized mechanical mode at $1.32\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and $4.2\,\mathrm{dB}$ for the second localized mode at $2.43\,\mathrm{MHz}$, as observed in direct detection when correcting for the detection inefficiency. Thus, we have demonstrated how squeezed light generation can be extended beyond a single octave in an optomechanical system by leveraging more than one mechanical mode. Utilizing homodyne detection to detect squeezing in an optimal quadrature would lead to squeezing levels at the output of the cavity of $7.3\,\mathrm{dB}$ and $6.8\,\mathrm{dB}$, in the two modes respectively. Squeezing of light demonstrated here for near-infrared light can be achieved in a broad range of wavelengths due to the relative insensitivity of optomechanical interaction with SiN membranes to the wavelength.</description>

      <title>Generation of Tunable Correlated Frequency Comb via Four-Wave-Mixing in Optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an all-fiber-based experimental setup to generate a correlated photon-pair comb using Four Wave Mixing (FWM) in Highly Non-Linear Fiber (HNLF). Temporal correlations of the generated photons were confirmed through coincidence measurements. We observed a maximum of 32 kcps, with a coincidence to accidental ratio of 17$\pm$1. To further understand the underlying processes, we also simulated a generalized FWM event involving the interaction between an arbitrary frequency comb and a Continuous Wave (CW) pump. Non-linear dynamics through the HNLF were modelled using Schr\"odinger propagation equations, with numerical predictions agreeing with our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Propulsion force and heat transfer for nonreciprocal nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze heat transfer and Casimir forces involving a nonreciprocal nanoparticle. By dissecting the resulting expressions into reciprocal and nonreciprocal contributions, we find that the particle's self emission contains $++$ and $--$ terms, i.e., the particle's reciprocal ($+$) and nonreciprocal ($-$) parts couple to the respective parts of its surrounding. In contrast, the heat transfer to the nanoparticle from the surrounding contains $-+$ and $+-$ contributions, which we find to persist at equal temperatures. For two nanoparticles, such persistent transfer is found to require one particle to be nonreciprocal and the other to be anisotropic. The propulsion force for the nanoparticle, for which our results agree with previous work, is dominated by $\pm\mp$ terms, making it distinct from forces found for reciprocal particles. The amplitude of the propulsion force can be orders of magnitude larger than gravitational forces. Despite being distinct, we find the $\pm\mp$ terms to be bound by $\pm\pm$ terms, a consequence of passivity of the objects. For the force, this bound limits the efficiency in a heat engine setup, as observed for parallel plates before.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Torque on an Inhomogeneous Chiral Body out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will experience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an object emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first order, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No force arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary (reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to the torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an inhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small quantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is provided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration will essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous chiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the realm of observability.</description>

      <title>Exact steady state of quantum van der Pol oscillator: critical phenomena and enhanced metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the enhancement of both the variance and changing rate of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Free-space model for a balloon-based quantum network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance communication is one of the main bottlenecks in the development of quantum communication networks. Free-space communication is a way to circumvent exponential fiber loss and to allow longer communication distances. Satellite nodes are the main devices currently studied for free-space communication, but they come with downsides such as high cost and low availability. In this work, we study an alternative to satellites, namely aerial platforms such as high-altitude balloons. We provide a loss model to simulate the channel efficiency of balloon-to-ground, ground-to-balloon, and balloon-to-balloon communication channels, considering a large set of hardware parameters. We perform a parameter exploration to exhibit important trade-offs in these channels, as well as simulations of different quantum key distribution network architectures including balloon nodes. We demonstrate that balloons are a realistic alternative to satellites for free-space communications in national network architectures.</description>

      <title>Classical Shadows with Improved Median-of-Means Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical shadows protocol, introduced by Huang et al. [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], makes use of the median-of-means (MoM) estimator to efficiently estimate the expectation values of $M$ observables with failure probability $\delta$ using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(M/\delta))$ measurements. In their analysis, Huang et al. used loose constants in their asymptotic performance bounds for simplicity. However, the specific values of these constants can significantly affect the number of shots used in practical implementations. To address this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker [PMLR 195, 5925 (2023)] that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over the data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete U-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second based on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the original and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol with single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin chain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. While the original estimator outperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified estimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to specific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical shadows protocol in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of three parallel spins with genuine and restricted collective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems are advantageous in information extraction than individual measurements. However, little is known about the distinction between restricted collective measurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting. In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and old estimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallel spins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimation fidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuine collective measurements. Moreover, we show that this estimation fidelity can be achieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication in one direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape of multipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum states and is expected to trigger further studies.</description>

      <title>Sensing and Control of Single Trapped Electrons Above 1 Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of cryogenic substrates (liquid helium, solid neon or hydrogen) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing made attractive by the inherent purity of the electron environment, the scalability of trapping devices and the predicted long lifetime of electron spin states. Here we demonstrate the spatial control and detection of single electrons above the surface of liquid helium at temperatures above 1 K. A superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge state of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium surface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with electrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts are in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a classical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout scheme can aid efforts to develop large-scale quantum processors that require the high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent interaction between free electrons and optical fields can produce free-electron compression and push the temporal resolution of ultrafast electron microscopy to the attosecond regime. However, a large electron-light interaction is required to attain a strong compression, generally necessitating short light and electron pulses combined with optical scattering at nanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate an alternative configuration based on stimulated Compton scattering, whereby two counterpropagating Gaussian light beams induce energy jumps in a colinear electron beam by multiples of their photon-energy difference. Strong recoil effects are produced by extending the electron-light interaction over millimetric distances, enabling a dramatic increase in temporal compression and substantially reshaping the electron spectra for affordable laser powers. Beyond its fundamental interest, our work introduces a practical scheme to achieve a large temporal compression of continuous electron beams without involving optical scattering by material structures.</description>

      <title>BOSS: Blocking algorithm for optimizing shuttling scheduling in Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion traps stand at the forefront of quantum hardware technology, presenting unparalleled benefits for quantum computing, such as high-fidelity gates, extensive connectivity, and prolonged coherence times. In this context, we explore the critical role of shuttling operations within these systems, especially their influence on the fidelity loss and elongated execution times. To address these challenges, we have developed BOSS, an efficient blocking algorithm tailored to enhance shuttling efficiency. This optimization not only bolsters the shuttling process but also elevates the overall efficacy of ion trap devices. We experimented on multiple applications using two qubit gates up to 4000+ and qubits ranging from 64 to 78. Our method significantly reduces the number of shuttles on most applications, with a maximum reduction of 96.1%. Additionally, our investigation includes simulations of realistic experimental parameters that incorporate sympathetic cooling, offering a higher fidelity and a refined estimate of execution times that align more closely with practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>A new fidelity of quantum channel evolution and its geometric interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity is crucial for characterizing transformations of quantum states under various quantum channels, which can be served as a fundamental tool in resource theories. Firstly, we define an $\alpha$-$z$-fidelity as a significant quantity in quantum information theory and give the properties of the fidelity with orders $\alpha$ and $z$. Secondly, by analyzing the $\alpha$-$z$-fidelity under the evolution of different types of quantum channels (single orbit, all quantum channels, unitary quantum channels, and mixed unitary quantum channels), we propose a limit formula for the maximum and the minimum of the $\alpha$-$z$-fidelity. In addition, we have extended the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi relative entropy, providing new insights into its relevance for resource quantification. Finally, we offer a geometric interpretation for measuring the distance between quantum states, contributing to the broader understanding of the operational and transformative power of dynamical quantum resources across various physical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a discrete spacetime model of fermions which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Large spin measurements in an arbitrary two-qudit state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used in many quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin measurements is still known only in a two-qubit case. In the present article, for a two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension $d=2s+1\geq2$, we introduce the notion of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix, having dimension $3\times3$ for all $d\geq2$; establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$ matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive in terms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for the two-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state and some nonseparable pure two-qudit states, we find that, under large spin ($s\geq1$) measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one, the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$ measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH inequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases with a growth of its entanglement degree, the situation under large spin measurements is quite different --for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree of entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be less than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a separable one.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the tunneling dynamics of few-fermion systems in lattices under asymmetric external potentials - a setup realizable in experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We first prove that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of the barrier's orientation. Then, we demonstrate that inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and lead to pronounced asymmetric tunneling. Remarkably, such a simple system exhibits an unexpectedly diverse range of dynamical behaviors, offering insights into the interplay among fermion-fermion interactions, barrier asymmetry, and spin configurations. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations: spin-singlet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-triplet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling - a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.</description>

      <title>Improving Perturbation Theory with the Sum-of-Squares: Third Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum-of-squares method can give rigorous lower bounds on the energy of quantum Hamiltonians. Unfortunately, typically using this method requires solving a semidefinite program, which can be computationally expensive. Further, the typically used degree-$4$ sum-of-squares (also known as the 2RDM method) does not correctly reproduce second order perturbation theory. Here, we give a general method, an analogue of Wigner's $2n+1$ rule for perturbation theory, to compute the order of the error in a given sum-of-squares ansatz. We also give a method for finding solutions of the dual semidefinite program, based on a perturbative ansatz combined with a self-consistent method. As an illustration, we show that for a class of model Hamiltonians (with a gap in the quadratic term and quartic terms chosen as i.i.d. Gaussians), this self-consistent sum-of-squares method significantly improves over the 2RDM method in both speed and accuracy, and also improves over low order perturbation theory. We then explain why the particular ansatz we implement is not suitable for use for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians (due to presence of certain large diagonal terms), but we suggest a modified ansatz that may be suitable, which will be the subject of future work.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{\hat{O}} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{\hat{O}e^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Acoustic black holes, white holes, and wormholes in Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar acoustic white hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state phase transitions in spin-Holstein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding coupled electron-phonon systems is one of the fundamental issues in strongly correlated systems. In this work, we aim to extend the notion of mixed-state phases to the realm of coupled electron/spinphonon systems. Specifically, we consider a two-dimensional cluster Hamiltonian locally coupled to a set of single bosonic modes with arbitrary coupling strength. First, we adopt a pure-state framework and examine whether a ground state phase transition out of the symmetry-protected topological phase can be captured using the standard polaron unitary transformation. This approach involves restricting the analysis to the low-energy manifold of the phonon degrees of freedom. We find that the pure-state approach fails to detect the anticipated transition to a topologically trivial phase at strong spin-phonon coupling. Next, we turn to a mixed-state picture. Here, we analyze mixed states of the model obtained by tracing out the phonons degrees of freedom. We employ two distinct diagnostics for mixed-state phase transitions: (i) the von Neumann conditional mutual information (CMI) and (ii) the R\'enyi-2 CMI. We argue that both measures detect signatures of mixed-state phase transitions, albeit at different critical spin-phonon coupling strengths, corresponding to subtly distinct notions of the mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects in quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</description>

      <title>Deep in the Knotted Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic idealism: what should you believe to experience next?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I argue for an approach to the Foundations of Physics that puts the question in the title center stage, rather than asking "what is the case in the world?". This approach, Algorithmic Idealism, attempts to give a mathematically rigorous in-principle-answer to this question both in the usual empirical regime of physics and more exotic regimes of cosmology, philosophy, and science fiction (but soon perhaps real) technology. I begin by arguing that quantum theory, in its actual practice and in some interpretations, should be understood as telling an agent what they should expect to observe next (rather than what is the case), and that the difficulty of answering this former question from the usual "external" perspective is at the heart of persistent enigmas such as the Boltzmann brain problem, extended Wigner's friend scenarios, Parfit's teletransportation paradox, or our understanding of the simulation hypothesis. Algorithmic Idealism is a conceptual framework, based on two postulates that admit several possible mathematical formalizations, cast in the language of algorithmic information theory. Here I give a non-technical description of this view and show how it dissolves the aforementioned enigmas: for example, it claims that you should never bet on being a Boltzmann brain regardless of how many there are, that shutting down computer simulations does not generally terminate its inhabitants, and it predicts the apparent embedding into an objective external world as an approximate description.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Hawking Effect on the Fully Entangled Fraction of Three-qubit States in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wu et al. [J. High Energ. Phys. 2023, 232 (2023)] first found that the fidelity of quantum teleportation with a bipartite entangled resource state, completely determined by the fully entangled fraction (FEF) characterized by the maximal fidelity between the given quantum state and the set of maximally entangled states, can monotonically increase in Schwarzschild spacetime. We investigated the Hawking effect on the FEF of quantum states in tripartite systems. In this paper, we show that the Hawking effect of a black hole may both decrease and increase the FEF in Schwarzschild spacetime. For an initial X-type state, we found that the Hawking effect of the black hole has both positive and negative impacts on the FEF of Dirac fields, depending on the selection of initial states. For an initial W-like state, the Hawking effect of the black hole has only a positive impact on the FEF of Dirac fields, independent of the selection of initial states. Our results provide an insightful view of quantum teleportation in multipartite systems under the influence of Hawking effects, from the perspective of quantum information and general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics is a notoriously abstract subject, and therefore challenging to teach at pre-college and introductory college levels. Here we introduce the Bloch Cube, a hands-on educational tool which can illustrate key quantum concepts without equations. A series of videos have been created showing how Bloch Cubes can be used to teach concepts such as quantum measurement, quantum dynamics, pure states versus mixed states, and quantum decoherence. Bloch Cube states can assist in the development of more sophisticated concepts such as the Bloch Sphere, which plays a central role in the quantum mechanics of two-state systems and quantum information science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically introduce synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields for topological quantum walks. The photonic mesh lattice configuration is generalized with polarization multiplexing to achieve a four-dimensional Hilbert space, based on which we provide photonic building blocks for realizing various quantum walks in non-Abelian gauge fields. It is found that SU(2) gauge fields can lead to Peierls substitution in both momenta and quasienergy. In one and two dimensions, we describe detailed photonic setups to realize topological quantum walk protocols whose Floquet winding numbers and Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin invariants can be effectively controlled by the gauge fields. Finally, we show how non-Abelian gauge fields facilitate convenient simulation of entanglement in conjunction with polarization-dependent and spatial-mode-dependent coin operations. Our results shed light on the study of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields in photonic Floquet systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation in the dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries by using the Rydberg atomic system. It is shown that Magnus expansion up to second order for the local lattice geometries can describe quantitatively the creation of the AF correlation for different lattice arrays, e.g., $2 \times n$ lattice, cyclic lattice with star, and triangular lattice. We find that the magnitude of AF correlation for the same Manhattan distance is the algebraic sum of the correlations contributed by all shortest paths -- a typical superposition law. Such a law is independent of nonequivalent paths, lattice geometries, and quench style.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Disordered Noninteracting Chains Coupled to a Local Lindblad Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder can prevent many-body quantum systems from reaching thermal equilibrium, leading to a many-body localized phase. Recent works suggest that nonperturbative effects caused by rare regions of low disorder may destabilize the localized phase. However, numerical simulations of interacting systems are generically possible only for small system sizes, where finite-size effects might dominate. Here we perform a numerical investigation of noninteracting disordered spin chains coupled to a local Lindblad bath at the boundary. Our results reveal strong finite-size effects in the Lindbladian gap in both bath-coupled Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models, leading to a non-monotonic behavior with the system size. We discuss the relaxation properties of a simple toy model coupled to local Lindblad baths, connecting its features to those of noninteracting localized chains. We comment on the implications of our findings for many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the impact of ideas of open quantum systems and quantum information to various facets of neutrino and neutral meson oscillations. These oscillations are characterized by a number of quantum correlations, both spatial as well as temporal. For neutrinos, the correlations are shown to be simple functions of the product of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities. The quantum correlations in the neutral mesons are seen to be non-trivially different from their stable counterparts.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled laser generation in a photonic crystal - liquid crystal - metal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive approach for simulating lasing dynamics in a liquid crystal based laser is presented. The approach takes into account the transformation of the liquid crystal structure caused by applied voltage. In particular, it allows us to explicitly account for a resonant mode frequency shift in the laser equations. The laser dynamic is described by a set of coupled non-linear differential equations for dye polarizations, population densities and the electromagnetic fields. The proposed model is applied to a photonic crystal$-$metal microcavity filled with a resonant nematic liquid crystal layer doped with a dye. The calculated lasing spectra governed by external electric field are verified in comparison with measured spectra.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Deep Thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the role of global system topology in governing deep thermalization, the relaxation of a local subsystem towards a maximally-entropic, uniform distribution of post-measurement states, upon observing the complementary subsystem in a local basis. Concretely, we focus on a class of (1+1)d systems exhibiting 'maximally-chaotic' dynamics, and consider how the rate of the formation of such a universal wavefunction distribution depends on boundary conditions of the system. We find that deep thermalization is achieved exponentially quickly in the presence of either periodic or open boundary conditions; however, the rate at which this occurs is twice as fast for the former than for the latter. These results are attained analytically using the calculus of integration over unitary groups, and supported by extensive numerical simulations. Our findings highlight the nonlocal nature of deep thermalization, and clearly illustrates that the physics underlying this phenomenon goes beyond that of standard quantum thermalization, which only depends on the net build-up of entanglement between a subsystem and its complement.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate highly tunable nonreciprocal coupling between levitated nanoparticles due to optical binding [Rieser et al., Science 377, 987 (2022)]. In view of recent experiments cooling nanoparticles to the quantum regime, we here develop the quantum theory of small dielectric objects interacting via the forces and torques induced by scattered tweezer photons. The interaction is fundamentally non-Hermitian and accompanied by correlated quantum noise. We present the corresponding Markovian quantum master equation and show how to reach nonreciprocal and unidirectional coupling. Our work provides the theoretical tools for exploring and exploiting the rich quantum physics of nonreciprocally coupled nanoparticle arrays.</description>

      <title>State preparation by shallow circuits using feed forward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14840v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, we need to repeat the following sequence of four steps: First, perform 1 or 2 qubit quantum gates (in parallel if possible). Second, do a syndrome measurement on a subset of the qubits. Third, perform a fast classical computation to establish which errors have occurred (if any). Fourth, depending on the errors, we apply a correction step. Then the procedure repeats with the next sequence of gates. In order for these four steps to succeed, we need the error rate of the gates to be below a certain threshold. Unfortunately, the error rates of current quantum hardware are still too high. On the other hand, current quantum hardware platforms are designed with these four steps in mind. In this work we make use of this four-step scheme not to carry out fault-tolerant computations, but to enhance short, constant-depth, quantum circuits that perform 1 qubit gates and nearest-neighbor 2 qubit gates. To explore how this can be useful, we study a computational model which we call Local Alternating Quantum Classical Computations (LAQCC). In this model, qubits are placed in a grid allowing nearest neighbor interactions; the quantum circuits are of constant depth with intermediate measurements; a classical controller can perform log-depth computations on these intermediate measurement outcomes to control future quantum operations. This model fits naturally between quantum algorithms in the NISQ era and full fledged fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that LAQCC circuits can create long-ranged interactions, which constant-depth quantum circuits cannot achieve, and use it to construct a range of useful multi-qubit gates. With these gates, we create three new state preparation protocols for a uniform superposition over an arbitrary number of states, W-states, Dicke states and may-body scar states.</description>

Abstract: A quantum engine with n qubits performing thermodynamic cycles with two thermal reservoirs is presented. While such constructions have been aplenty, here we show the existence of what we term as "limit cycle" at a purely quantum level of description owing to the properties of superoperators governing the evolution of states. It is shown that the limit cycle is the same under forward and reverse protocol of cycle operations. This limit cycle becomes the basis of the quantum engine. One dimensional Ising model has been used to illustrate these ideas.</description>

      <title>Strong hole-photon coupling in planar Ge for probing charge degree and strongly-correlated states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures have emerged as front-runners for future hole-based quantum processors. Here, we present strong coupling between a hole charge qubit, defined in a double quantum dot (DQD) in planar Ge, and microwave photons in a high-impedance ($Z_\mathrm{r} = 1.3 ~\mathrm{k}\Omega$) resonator based on an array of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Our investigation reveals vacuum-Rabi splittings with coupling strengths up to $g_0/2\pi = 260 ~\mathrm{MHz}$, and a cooperativity of $C \sim 100$, dependent on DQD tuning. Furthermore, utilizing the frequency tunability of our resonator, we explore the quenched energy splitting associated with strong Coulomb correlation effects in Ge QDs. The observed enhanced coherence of the strongly correlated excited state signals the presence of distinct symmetries within related spin functions, serving as a precursor to the strong coupling between photons and spin-charge hybrid qubits in planar Ge. This work paves the way towards coherent quantum connections between remote hole qubits in planar Ge, required to scale up hole-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Techniques for learning sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error-mitigation techniques such as probabilistic error cancellation and zero-noise extrapolation benefit from accurate noise models. The sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise model is one of the most successful models for those applications. In existing implementations, the model decomposes into a series of simple Pauli channels with one- and two-local terms that follow the qubit topology. While the model has been shown to accurately capture the noise in contemporary superconducting quantum processors for error mitigation, it is important to consider higher-weight terms and effects beyond nearest-neighbor interactions. For such extended models to remain practical, however, we need to ensure that they can be learned efficiently. In this work we present new techniques that accomplish exactly this. We introduce twirling based on Pauli rotations, which enables us to automatically generate single-qubit learning correction sequences and reduce the number of unique fidelities that need to be learned. In addition, we propose a basis-selection strategy that leverages graph coloring and uniform covering arrays to minimize the number of learning bases. Taken together, these techniques ensure that the learning of the extended noise models remains efficient, despite their increased complexity.</description>

      <title>Counting collisions in random circuit sampling for benchmarking quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that counting the number of collisions (re-sampled bitstrings) when measuring a random quantum circuit provides a practical benchmark for the quality of a quantum computer and a quantitative noise characterization method. We analytically estimate the difference in the expected number of collisions when sampling bitstrings from a pure random state and when sampling from the classical uniform distribution. We show that this quantity, if properly normalized, can be used as a "collision anomaly" benchmark or as a "collision volume" test which is similar to the well-known quantum volume test, with advantages (no classical computing cost) and disadvantages (high sampling cost). We also propose to count the number of cross-collisions between two independent quantum computers running the same random circuit in order to obtain a cross-validation test of the two devices. Finally, we quantify the sampling cost of quantum collision experiments. We find that the sampling cost for running a collision volume test on state-of-the-art processors (e.g.~20 effective clean qubits) is quite small: less than $10^5$ shots. For large-scale experiments in the quantum supremacy regime the required number of shots for observing a quantum signal in the observed number of collisions is currently infeasible ($&gt;10^{12}$), but not completely out of reach for near-future technology.</description>

Abstract: The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernel machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this paper we represent CV quantum kernels as closed form functions and use this representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such kernel can be expressed as the product of a Gaussian and an algebraic function of the parameters of the feature map. Furthermore, in the multi-mode case, we present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for all quantum kernels via a hierarchical notion of the ``stellar rank" of the quantum kernel feature map. We then prove kernels defined by feature maps of infinite stellar rank, such as GKP-state encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by kernels defined by feature maps of finite stellar rank. Finally, we simulate learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state encoding and show that (i) accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set) increases with stellar rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved by increasing a bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is overfit, decreasing the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at the cost of effective stellar rank.</description>

Abstract: Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of a shallow neural network to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain, as the number of parameters increases. We train our ansatz by a supervised learning procedure, minimizing the infidelity w.r.t. the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz improves with the network width in most cases, and eventually saturates. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), particularly its rank. By introducing an appropriate indicator, we establish that the QGT rank provides a useful diagnostic for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect is a distinctive phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describing the nontrivial effect of frequent projective measurements on hindering the evolution of a quantum system. However, when subjected to environmental noise, the quantum system may dissipate, and the quantum Zeno effect no longer works. This research starts from the physical mechanism for the decay of the quantum Zeno effect in the presence of noise and investigates the effect of coherent quantum controls on mitigating the decrease of the survival probability that the system stays in the initial state induced by the noise. We derive the decay rate of the survival probability with and without coherent quantum controls in general, and show that when the frequency of the projective measurements is large but finite, proper coherent controls by sufficiently strong Hamiltonians can be designed to decrease the decay rate of the survival probability. A two-level quantum system suffering from typical unitary and nonunitary noise is then considered to demonstrate the effect of the proposed coherent quantum control scheme in protecting the quantum Zeno effect against the noise. The decay rate of the survival probability is obtained in the presence of noise, and the control Hamiltonian is further optimized analytically to minimize the decay rate by a variational approach. The evolution paths of the quantum system with the optimal coherent controls are illustrated numerically for different scenarios to explicitly show how the coherent control scheme works in lowering the decay of survival probability.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Port-Based State Preparation (PBSP), a teleportation task where Alice holds a complete classical description of the target state and Bob's correction operations are restricted to only tracing out registers. We show a protocol that implements PBSP with error decreasing exponentially in the number of ports, in contrast to the polynomial trade-off for the related task of Port-Based Teleportation, and we prove that this is optimal when a maximally entangled resource state is used.
  As an application, we introduce approximate Universal Programmable Hybrid Processors (UPHP). Here the goal is to encode a unitary as a quantum state, and the UPHP can apply this unitary to a quantum state when knowing its classical description. We give a construction that needs strictly less memory in terms of dimension than the optimal approximate Universal Programmable Quantum Processor achieving the same error. Additionally, we provide lower bounds for the optimal trade-off between memory and error of UPHPs.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermalization in contemporary quantum devices, in particular quantum computers, has recently attracted significant theoretical interest. Unusual thermalization processes, such as the Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME), have been explored theoretically. However, there is a shortage of experimental results due to the difficulty in preparing thermal states. In this paper, we propose a protocol to indirectly address this challenge. Moreover, we experimentally validate our protocol using IBM quantum devices, providing results for unusual relaxation in equidistant quenches as predicted for the IBM qubit. We also assess the formalism introduced for the QME, obtaining results consistent with the theoretical predictions. This demonstration underscores that our protocol can provide an alternative way of studying thermal states physics when their direct preparation may be too difficult.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues. Namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. Besides, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. We also discuss how the results are generalized to POVM measurements. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

Abstract: Observational entropy -- a quantity that unifies Boltzmann's entropy, Gibbs' entropy, von Neumann's macroscopic entropy, and the diagonal entropy -- has recently been argued to play a key role in a modern formulation of statistical mechanics. Here, relying on algebraic techniques taken from Petz's theory of statistical sufficiency and on a L\'evy-type concentration bound, we prove rigorous theorems showing how the observational entropy of a system undergoing a unitary evolution chosen at random tends to increase with overwhelming probability and to reach its maximum very quickly. More precisely, we show that for any observation that is sufficiently coarse with respect to the size of the system, regardless of the initial state of the system (be it pure or mixed), random evolution renders its state practically indistinguishable from the uniform (i.e., maximally mixed) distribution with a probability approaching one as the size of the system grows. The same conclusion holds not only for random evolutions sampled according to the unitarily invariant Haar distribution, but also for approximate 2-designs, which are thought to provide a more physically and computationally reasonable model of random evolutions.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of Quantum Entanglement for Enhancing Precision in Frequency Estimation</title>

Abstract: We investigate strategies for reaching the ultimate limit on the precision of frequency estimation when the number of probes used in each run of the experiment is fixed. That limit is set by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB), which predicts that the use of maximally entangled probes enhances the estimation precision, when compared with the use of independent probes. However, the bound is only achievable if the statistical model used in the estimation remains identifiable throughout the procedure. This in turn sets different limits on the maximal sensing time used in each run of the estimation procedure, when entangled and independent probes are used. When those constraints are taken into account, one can show that, when the total number of probes and the total duration of the estimation process are counted as fixed resources, the use of entangled probes is, in fact, disadvantageous when compared with the use of independent probes. In order to counteract the limitations imposed on the sensing time by the requirement of identifiability of the statistical model, we propose a time-adaptive strategy, in which the sensing time is adequately increased at each step of the estimation process, calculate an attainable error bound for the strategy and discuss how to optimally choose its parameters in order to minimize that bound. We show that the proposed strategy leads to much better scaling of the estimation uncertainty with the total number of probes and the total sensing time than the traditional fixed-sensing-time strategy. We also show that, when the total number of probes and the total sensing time are counted as resources, independent probes and maximally entangled ones have now the same performance, in contrast to the non-adaptive strategy, where the use of independent is more advantageous than the use of maximally entangled ones.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) plays a crucial role in optimizing quantum circuit execution on physical quantum devices. As we enter the era where quantum computers have hundreds of qubits, we are faced with scalability issues using optimal approaches and degrading heuristic methods' performance due to the lack of global optimization. To this end, we introduce a hybrid design that obtains the much improved solution for the heuristic method utilizing the multilevel framework, which is an effective methodology to solve large-scale problems in VLSI design. In this paper, we present ML-QLS, the first multilevel quantum layout tool with a scalable refinement operation integrated with novel cost functions and clustering strategies. Our clustering provides valuable insights into generating a proper problem approximation for quantum circuits and devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that ML-QLS can scale up to problems involving hundreds of qubits and achieve a remarkable 52% performance improvement over leading heuristic QLS tools for large circuits, which underscores the effectiveness of multilevel frameworks in quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transient dynamics of the quantum Stuart-Landau oscillator, the paradigm of a quantum system exhibiting the quantum limit cycle and synchronization. By considering the energy dynamics, we determine a condition for the validity of the classical-regime approximation -- the classical regime eligibility. We also determine the condition for the limit cycle's classical regime and formulate a guess function that fits the steady-state Wigner function. The equation of motion for the Wigner function is derived and compared to the Kramers-Moyal equation for stochastic processes. We study the classical-like behavior embodied by the coherent state in the quantum phase space, comparing its evolution with or without the classical regime eligibility and attributing its lengthy evolution to the slowness of the neighboring-level coherence decay. Furthermore, we consider the evolution of the Wigner negativity as an indicator of quantumness. The Wigner negativity can increase in some cases due to the nonlinear dissipation. To study the evolution speed, we analyze the Liouvillian gap of the system and record the time to reach the steady state for the Fock, thermal, and coherent states. The steady-state time may behave differently from the Liouvillian gap, depending on the initial state. For the diagonal states, there are speedy parameters for which the steady-state time is significantly lowered.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Experimental Imperfections on Photonic GHZ State Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the advantages of photonic quantum computing, including direct compatibility with communication, are apparent, several imperfections such as loss and distinguishability presently limit actual implementations. These imperfections are unlikely to be completely eliminated, and it is therefore beneficial to investigate which of these are the most dominant and what is achievable under their presence. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation of the influence of photon loss, multi-photon terms and photon distinguishability on the generation of photonic 3-partite GHZ states via established fusion protocols. We simulate the generation process for SPDC and solid-state-based single-photon sources using realistic parameters and show that different types of imperfections are dominant with respect to the fidelity and generation success probability. Our results indicate what are the dominant imperfections for the different photon sources and in which parameter regimes we can hope to implement photonic quantum computing in the near future.</description>

      <title>Speedup of thermodynamic entropy production via quantum dynamical criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of quantum phase transitions has long been a rich area of research, providing numerous insights and enhancing our understanding of this important phenomenon. This theoretical framework has been well-developed specially because quantum phase transitions occur at equilibrium. However, its dynamical counterpart, known as dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs), takes place out-of-equilibrium, where conventional thermodynamic tools are inapplicable. In this work, we make progress in this area by connecting dynamical criticality to thermodynamics through a geometric perspective on entropy production. Our findings, along with other recent developments, suggest that dynamical criticality can lead the system to highly complex dynamics, indicating a possible pathway to thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We may soon see agencies offering public access to quantum communication networks. In such networks it may be a feature that certain resources are available only to priority users or at a higher user fee, as governed by a protective agency overseeing the communication in the network. If the agency wants to restrict the general users to communicate by transmitting states that we categorize as free states of a quantum resource theory (QRT), it may employ resource-destroying (RD) channels that do not affect the free states. Such channels, however, only exist for the simplest of QRTs, putting fundamental limitations on how quantum resources can be regulated. In this work, we go beyond the present limitation by devising a nonlinear censorship protocol which makes use of classical information about the transmitted state. We study the requirement disabling malicious users from breaking the censorship. The protocol can establish an unbreakable censorship of imaginarity and entanglement, while no such censorship can be made for quantum discord and Bell nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Three-Nucleons System Transition on Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers have proven to be effective in simulating many quantum systems. Simulating nuclear processes and state preparation poses significant challenges, even for traditional supercomputers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a complete simulation of a nuclear transition, including the preparation of both ground and first excited states. To tackle the complexity of strong interactions between two and three nucleons, the states are modeled on the tritium nucleus. Both the initial and final states are represented using quantum circuits with variational quantum algorithms and inductive biases. Describing the spin-isospin states requires four qubits, and a parameterized quantum circuit that exploits a total of 16 parameters is initialized. The estimated energy has a relative error of approximately 2% for the ground state and about 10% for the first excited state of the system. The simulation estimates the transition probability between the two states as a function of the dipole polarization angle. This work marks a first step towards leveraging digital quantum computers to simulate nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <title>Frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber using continuous-wave fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers, photons are the fundamental carriers of information as so-called flying qubits. They may also serve as the interconnect between different components of a hybrid architecture, which might comprise atomic and solid state platforms operating at visible or near-infrared wavelengths, as well as optical links in the telecom band. Quantum frequency conversion is the pathway to change the color of a single photon while preserving its quantum state. Currently, nonlinear crystals are utilized for this process. However, their performance is limited by their acceptance bandwidth, tunability, polarization sensitivity, as well as undesired background emission. A promising alternative is based on stimulated Raman scattering in gases.
  Here, we demonstrate polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber. This approach holds promises for seamless integration into optical fiber networks and interfaces to single emitters. Disparate from related experiments that employ a pulsed pump field, we here take advantage of two coherent continuous-wave pump fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the decoherence found in previous works is due to the sudden switching on of the system-environment interaction and due to the acceleration of the electron enforced by the background paths whose superposition was analyzed. The work discusses important theoretical aspects of the setup and shows that while coherence might be lost due to bremsstrahlung induced by an external or the image potential, it cannot be lost due to the mere presence of the quantum vacuum fluctuations between the plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator-type Hamiltonians, it is shown that there is a relation between the energy eigenvalues of parity symmetric and PT-symmetric phases for weak coupling. The possibility of such a relation was conjectured by Ai, Bender and Sarkar on examining the imaginary part of the ground state energy using path integrals. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the conjecture is true also for the real part of the ground state energy and of the excited state energies. However, the conjecture is false for strong coupling. The analogous relation for partition functions in zero spacetime dimensions is valid for many cases. However $O(N)$ symmetric multi-component scalar fields, with $N&gt;1$ and a quartic interaction, do not satisfy the conjecture for zero and one dimensional spacetime. The possibility that the conjecture is valid, for a single component field theory in higher dimensional spacetimes, is discussed in a simplified model.</description>

Abstract: Developing a quantum light source that carries more than one bit per photon is pivotal for expanding quantum information applications. Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is currently gaining significant attention, not only from the academic community but also from industry, due to its potential applications across several fields for addressing complex problems. For any practical problem which may be tackled using quantum computing, it is imperative to represent the data used onto a quantum computing system. Depending on the application, many different types of data and data structures occur, including regular numbers, higher-dimensional data structures, e.g., n-dimensional images, up to graphs. This report aims to provide an overview of existing methods for representing these data types on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum algorithm for determining graph connectedness using a constant number of measurements. The algorithm can be extended to find connected components with a linear number of measurements. It relies on non-unitary abelian gates taken from ZX calculus. Due to the fusion rule, the two-qubit gates correspond to a large single action on the qubits. The algorithm is general and can handle any undirected graph, including those with repeated edges and self-loops. The depth of the algorithm is variable, depending on the graph, and we derive upper and lower bounds. The algorithm exhibits a state decay that can be remedied with ancilla qubits. We provide a numerical simulation of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>Symmetry protected topological phases under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16323v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ensembles described by density matrices with potentially nontrivial topological features. In particular, we study a class of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases under various types of decoherence, which can drive a pure SPT state into a mixed state. We demonstrate that the system can still retain the nontrivial topological information from the SPT ground state even under decoherence. In the "doubled Hilbert space", we provide a general definition for symmetry protected topological ensemble (SPT ensemble), and the main quantity that we investigate is various types of (boundary) anomalies in the doubled Hilbert space. We show that the notion of the strange correlator, previously proposed to as a diagnosis for the SPT ground states, can be generalized to capture these anomalies in mixed-state density matrices. Using both exact calculations of the stabilizer Hamiltonians and field theory evaluations, we demonstrate that under decoherence the nontrivial features of the SPT state can persist in the two types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. We show that the nontrivial type-I strange correlator corresponds to the presence of the SPT information that can be efficiently identified and utilized from experiments, such as for the purpose of preparing for long-range entangled states. The nontrivial type-II strange correlator encodes the full topological response of the decohered mixed state density matrix, i.e., the information about the presence of the SPT state before decoherence. Therefore, our work provides a unified framework to understand decohered SPT phases from the information-theoretic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by Sub-chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator, are dictated to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant matrix, the sub-chiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without chiral symmetry but with sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system with unreduced dynamics governed by invertible propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the temporal evolution of asset prices is crucial for understanding financial markets. We explore the potential of discrete-time quantum walks to model the evolution of asset prices. Return distributions obtained from a model based on the quantum walk algorithm are compared with those obtained from classical methodologies. We focus on specific limitations of the classical models, and illustrate that the quantum walk model possesses great flexibility in overcoming these. This includes the potential to generate asymmetric return distributions with complex market tendencies and higher probabilities for extreme events than in some of the classical models. Furthermore, the temporal evolution in the quantum walk possesses the potential to provide asset price dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host exotic topological states that go beyond the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence. Up to now, there is still a lack of experimentally measurable momentum-space topological characterization for the HOTPs, which is not conducive to revealing the essential properties of these topological states and also restricts their detection in quantum simulation systems. Here, we propose a concept of polarized topological charges to characterize chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space, which further facilitates a feasible experimental scheme to detect the HOTPs in $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system. Remarkably, our characterization theory not only shows that the second-order (third-order) topological phases are determined by a quarter (negative eighth) of the total polarized topological charges, but also reveals that the higher-order topological phase transitions are identified by the creation or annihilation of polarized topological charges. Particularly, these polarized topological charges can be measured by pseudospin structures of the systems. Due to theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness, this work shall advance the broad studies of the HOTPs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

      <title>Tackling Decision Processes with Non-Cumulative Objectives using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>
