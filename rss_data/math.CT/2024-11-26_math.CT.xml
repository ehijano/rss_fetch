      <title>Deformations of triangulated categories with t-structures via derived injectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the final ingredient in the development of the deformation theory of pretriangulated dg-categories endowed with a nice t-structure, which was initiated by the authors and is modeled after the previously developed deformation theory of abelian categories. We show how to extend a t-structure on a pretriangulated dg-category to its dg-derived category so that the Yoneda embedding becomes t-exact. We construct several equivalences between deformation problems; in particular, we prove a deformation equivalence between the bounded t-deformations of a bounded t-dg-category on the one hand, and dg-deformations of the dg-category of derived injective ind-dg-objects on the other hand. Since this latter dg-category is cohomologically concentrated in nonpositive degrees, we do not encounter curvature.</description>

      <title>The Boolean spectrum of a Grothendieck category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A notion of support for objects in any Grothendieck category is introduced. This is based on the spectral category of a Grothendieck category and uses its Boolean lattice of localising subcategories. The support provides a classification of all subcategories that are closed under arbitrary coproducts, subobjects, and essential extensions. There is also a notion of exact support which classifies certain thick subcategories. As an application we extend for any ring Crawley-Boevey's correspondence between definable subcategories of modules and closed subsets of the Ziegler spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for extended module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extended hearts of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, we provide a Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting theorem and a characterization for $s$-torsion pairs. Applying these to $m$-extended module categories, we characterize torsion pairs induced by $(m+1)$-term silting complexes. After establishing Auslander-Reiten theory in extended module categories, we introduce $\tau_{[m]}$-tilting pairs and show bijections between $\tau_{[m]}$-tilting pairs, $(m+1)$-term silting complexes, and functorially finite $s$-torsion pairs.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously nonvanishing higher derived limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The derived functors $\lim^n$ of the inverse limit find many applications in algebra and topology. In particular, the vanishing of certain derived limits $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H]$, parametrized by an abelian group $H$, has implications for strong homology and condensed mathematics. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathfrak{d}=\omega_n$, then $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] \neq 0$ holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}^{(\omega_n)}$ (i.e. the direct sum of $\omega_n$-many copies of $\mathbb{Z}$). The same holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}$ under the assumption that $\mathrm{w}\diamondsuit(S^{k+1}_k)$ holds for all $k &lt; n$. In particular, this shows that if $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] = 0$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ and all abelian groups $H$, then $2^{\aleph_0} \geq \aleph_{\omega+1}$, thus answering a question of Bannister. Finally, we prove some consistency results regarding simultaneous nonvanishing of derived limits, again in the case of $H = \mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we show the consistency, relative to $\mathsf{ZFC}$, of $\bigwedge_{2 \leq k &lt; \omega} \lim^k \mathbf{A} \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Dialectica Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The categorical modeling of Petri nets has received much attention recently. The Dialectica construction has also had its fair share of attention. We revisit the use of the Dialectica construction as a categorical model for Petri nets generalising the original application to suggest that Petri nets with different kinds of transitions can be modelled in the same categorical framework. Transitions representing truth-values, probabilities, rates or multiplicities, evaluated in different algebraic structures called lineales are useful and are modelled here in the same category. We investigate (categorical instances of) this generalised model and its connections to more recent models of categorical nets.</description>

      <title>Pointfree topology and constructive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constructive approach to mathematics has the advantage that witnesses can be extracted from statements of existence and theorems can be unwound to give algorithms. Even better, constructive theorems can be interpreted in any topos, giving many different results for the price of one. On the other hand, you might have heard that fundamental results from topology such as Tychonoff's theorem or even the intermediate value theorem do not hold constructively, which can make the price of constructive theorems seem rather steep. However, almost all of these pathologies disappear if we take the pointfree approach to topology, in which spaces are studied algebraically and logically through their lattices of opens without reference to a predefined underlying set of points. In fact, this perspective also sheds light on aspects of constructive mathematics that might at first appear to have little to do with topology. These notes provide a gentle introduction to the main aspects of constructive pointfree topology and some of its applications.</description>

      <title>A contramodule generalization of Neeman's flat and projective module theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of arXiv:2306.02734. We consider a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the homotopy category of projective left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent to the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, and also to the homotopy category of flat cotorsion left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is contraacyclic (in the sense of Becker) if and only if it is an acyclic complex with flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles, and if and only if it is coacyclic as a complex in the exact category of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. These are contramodule generalizations of theorems of Neeman and of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada.</description>
