      <title>Stokes Waves in Water of Finite Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic water waves of permanent form traveling at constant speed, the so-called Stokes waves, are studied in water of fixed finite depth using methods previously used in water of infinite depth. We apply our methods to waves of varying steepness over a range of fixed depths in order to determine how a number of physical quantities related to the waves change as the steepness of the waves increases. Finally, we examine the Taylor sign condition for these waves, as well as the complex singularities outside of their domain of definition when the waves are considered as a function of a conformal variable.</description>

      <title>The size of the sync basin resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to model the winding number as a sum of weakly dependent variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

      <title>Stable supersolids and boselets in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the stability of supersolid striped waves, plane-wave boselets, and other extended states in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive three-body interactions (R3BIs), modeled by quintic terms in the framework of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the absence of R3BIs, the extended states are susceptible to the modulational instability (MI) induced by the cubic attractive nonlinearity. Using the linearized Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we identify multiple new types of MI, including baseband, passband, mixedband, and zero-wavenumber-gain ones, which give rise to deterministic rogue waves and complex nonlinear wave patterns. Our analysis reveals that R3BIs eliminate baseband and zero-wavenumber-gain MIs, forming, instead, phonon modes that enable stable boselets. Additionally, mixedband and passband MIs are suppressed, which results in a lattice-like phonon-roton mode that supports a stable supersolid phase. These stable supersolids can be realized using currently available ultracold experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Beyond water limitation in vegetation-autotoxicity patterning: a cross-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models describing vegetation patterns are based on biomass--water interactions, due to the impact of this limited resource in arid and semi-arid environments. However, in recent years, a novel biological factor called autotoxicity has proved to play a key role in vegetation spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly by inhibiting biomass growth and increasing its natural mortality rate. In a standard reaction-diffusion framework, biomass-toxicity dynamics alone are unable to support the emergence of stable spatial patterns. In this paper, we derive a cross-diffusion model for biomass and toxicity dynamics as the fast-reaction limit of a three-species system involving dichotomy and different time scales. Within this general framework, in addition to growth inhibition and extra-mortality already considered in previous studies, the additional effect of ''propagation reduction'' induced by autotoxicity on vegetation dynamics is obtained. By combining linearised analysis, simulations, and continuation, we investigate the formation of spatial patterns. Thanks to the cross-diffusion term, for the first time, a spatial model based solely on biomass-toxicity feedback without explicit water dynamics supports the formation of stable (Turing) vegetation patterns for a wide range of parameter values.</description>
