      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>

      <title>Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Deep Graph and Capsule Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective retinal vessel segmentation requires a sophisticated integration of global contextual awareness and local vessel continuity. To address this challenge, we propose the Graph Capsule Convolution Network (GCC-UNet), which merges capsule convolutions with CNNs to capture both local and global features. The Graph Capsule Convolution operator is specifically designed to enhance the representation of global context, while the Selective Graph Attention Fusion module ensures seamless integration of local and global information. To further improve vessel continuity, we introduce the Bottleneck Graph Attention module, which incorporates Channel-wise and Spatial Graph Attention mechanisms. The Multi-Scale Graph Fusion module adeptly combines features from various scales. Our approach has been rigorously validated through experiments on widely used public datasets, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each component. Comparative results highlight GCC-UNet's superior performance over existing methods, setting a new benchmark in retinal vessel segmentation. Notably, this work represents the first integration of vanilla, graph, and capsule convolutional techniques in the domain of medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Hybrid framework for ANomaly Detection (HAND) -- applied to Screening Mammogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for enhancing the generalization of AI models used in mammogram screening. Given the challenge of limited prior knowledge about OOD samples in external datasets, unsupervised generative learning is a preferable solution which trains the model to discern the normal characteristics of in-distribution (ID) data. The hypothesis is that during inference, the model aims to reconstruct ID samples accurately, while OOD samples exhibit poorer reconstruction due to their divergence from normality. Inspired by state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid architectures combining CNNs and transformers, we developed a novel backbone - HAND, for detecting OOD from large-scale digital screening mammogram studies. To boost the learning efficiency, we incorporated synthetic OOD samples and a parallel discriminator in the latent space to distinguish between ID and OOD samples. Gradient reversal to the OOD reconstruction loss penalizes the model for learning OOD reconstructions. An anomaly score is computed by weighting the reconstruction and discriminator loss. On internal RSNA mammogram held-out test and external Mayo clinic hand-curated dataset, the proposed HAND model outperformed encoder-based and GAN-based baselines, and interestingly, it also outperformed the hybrid CNN+transformer baselines. Therefore, the proposed HAND pipeline offers an automated efficient computational solution for domain-specific quality checks in external screening mammograms, yielding actionable insights without direct exposure to the private medical imaging data.</description>

      <title>Using Physics Informed Generative Adversarial Networks to Model 3D porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-CT scanning of rocks significantly enhances our understanding of pore-scale physics in porous media. With advancements in pore-scale simulation methods, such as pore network models, it is now possible to accurately simulate multiphase flow properties, including relative permeability, from CT-scanned rock samples. However, the limited number of CT-scanned samples and the challenge of connecting pore-scale networks to field-scale rock properties often make it difficult to use pore-scale simulated properties in realistic field-scale reservoir simulations. Deep learning approaches to create synthetic 3D rock structures allow us to simulate variations in CT rock structures, which can then be used to compute representative rock properties and flow functions. However, most current deep learning methods for 3D rock structure synthesis don't consider rock properties derived from well observations, lacking a direct link between pore-scale structures and field-scale data. We present a method to construct 3D rock structures constrained to observed rock properties using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with conditioning accomplished through a gradual Gaussian deformation process. We begin by pre-training a Wasserstein GAN to reconstruct 3D rock structures. Subsequently, we use a pore network model simulator to compute rock properties. The latent vectors for image generation in GAN are progressively altered using the Gaussian deformation approach to produce 3D rock structures constrained by well-derived conditioning data. This GAN and Gaussian deformation approach enables high-resolution synthetic image generation and reproduces user-defined rock properties such as porosity, permeability, and pore size distribution. Our research provides a novel way to link GAN-generated models to field-derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware Dynamic Image Denoising and Positron Range Correction for Rubidium-82 Cardiac PET Imaging via Self-supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rb-82 is a radioactive isotope widely used for cardiac PET imaging. Despite numerous benefits of 82-Rb, there are several factors that limits its image quality and quantitative accuracy. First, the short half-life of 82-Rb results in noisy dynamic frames. Low signal-to-noise ratio would result in inaccurate and biased image quantification. Noisy dynamic frames also lead to highly noisy parametric images. The noise levels also vary substantially in different dynamic frames due to radiotracer decay and short half-life. Existing denoising methods are not applicable for this task due to the lack of paired training inputs/labels and inability to generalize across varying noise levels. Second, 82-Rb emits high-energy positrons. Compared with other tracers such as 18-F, 82-Rb travels a longer distance before annihilation, which negatively affect image spatial resolution. Here, the goal of this study is to propose a self-supervised method for simultaneous (1) noise-aware dynamic image denoising and (2) positron range correction for 82-Rb cardiac PET imaging. Tested on a series of PET scans from a cohort of normal volunteers, the proposed method produced images with superior visual quality. To demonstrate the improvement in image quantification, we compared image-derived input functions (IDIFs) with arterial input functions (AIFs) from continuous arterial blood samples. The IDIF derived from the proposed method led to lower AUC differences, decreasing from 11.09% to 7.58% on average, compared to the original dynamic frames. The proposed method also improved the quantification of myocardium blood flow (MBF), as validated against 15-O-water scans, with mean MBF differences decreased from 0.43 to 0.09, compared to the original dynamic frames. We also conducted a generalizability experiment on 37 patient scans obtained from a different country using a different scanner.</description>

      <title>NCT-CRC-HE: Not All Histopathological Datasets Are Equally Useful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been proposed for histopathological image analysis over the past years. While they usually demonstrate exceptionally high accuracy, one key question is whether their precision might be affected by low-level image properties not related to histopathology but caused by microscopy image handling and pre-processing. In this paper, we analyze a popular NCT-CRC-HE-100K colorectal cancer dataset used in numerous prior works and show that both this dataset and the obtained results may be affected by data-specific biases. The most prominent revealed dataset issues are inappropriate color normalization, severe JPEG artifacts inconsistent between different classes, and completely corrupted tissue samples resulting from incorrect image dynamic range handling. We show that even the simplest model using only 3 features per image (red, green and blue color intensities) can demonstrate over 50% accuracy on this 9-class dataset, while using color histogram not explicitly capturing cell morphology features yields over 82% accuracy. Moreover, we show that a basic EfficientNet-B0 ImageNet pretrained model can achieve over 97.7% accuracy on this dataset, outperforming all previously proposed solutions developed for this task, including dedicated foundation histopathological models and large cell morphology-aware neural networks. The NCT-CRC-HE dataset is publicly available and can be freely used to replicate the presented results. The codes and pre-trained models used in this paper are available at https://github.com/gmalivenko/NCT-CRC-HE-experiments</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Data Aggregation for Axon and Myelin Segmentation in Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying axon and myelin properties (e.g., axon diameter, myelin thickness, g-ratio) in histology images can provide useful information about microstructural changes caused by neurodegenerative diseases. Automatic tissue segmentation is an important tool for these datasets, as a single stained section can contain up to thousands of axons. Advances in deep learning have made this task quick and reliable with minimal overhead, but a deep learning model trained by one research group will hardly ever be usable by other groups due to differences in their histology training data. This is partly due to subject diversity (different body parts, species, genetics, pathologies) and also to the range of modern microscopy imaging techniques resulting in a wide variability of image features (i.e., contrast, resolution). There is a pressing need to make AI accessible to neuroscience researchers to facilitate and accelerate their workflow, but publicly available models are scarce and poorly maintained. Our approach is to aggregate data from multiple imaging modalities (bright field, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy) and species (mouse, rat, rabbit, human), to create an open-source, durable tool for axon and myelin segmentation. Our generalist model makes it easier for researchers to process their data and can be fine-tuned for better performance on specific domains. We study the benefits of different aggregation schemes. This multi-domain segmentation model performs better than single-modality dedicated learners (p=0.03077), generalizes better on out-of-distribution data and is easier to use and maintain. Importantly, we package the segmentation tool into a well-maintained open-source software ecosystem (see https://github.com/axondeepseg/axondeepseg).</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network structure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At present, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI classification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven characteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve optimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a spiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width mixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction operations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking mixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral features. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine approximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of spike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train supervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative experiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on spiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental results show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting effect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time step reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about 63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN based HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance for promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in edge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Learning Approach on Tuberculosis Classification Based on Chest X-Ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment effectiveness and reducing transmission risk. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through image classification of chest X-rays, can assist in TB detection. However, class imbalance in TB chest X-ray datasets presents a challenge for accurate classification. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach using the Prototypical Network algorithm to address this issue. We compare the performance of ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGG16 in feature extraction from the TBX11K Chest X-ray dataset. Experimental results demonstrate classification accuracies of 98.93% for ResNet-18, 98.60% for ResNet-50, and 33.33% for VGG16. These findings indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in mitigating data imbalance, which is particularly beneficial for disease classification applications.</description>

      <title>LFIC-DRASC: Deep Light Field Image Compression Using Disentangled Representation and Asymmetrical Strip Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-Field (LF) image is emerging 4D data of light rays that is capable of realistically presenting spatial and angular information of 3D scene. However, the large data volume of LF images becomes the most challenging issue in real-time processing, transmission, and storage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep LF Image Compression method Using Disentangled Representation and Asymmetrical Strip Convolution (LFIC-DRASC) to improve coding efficiency. Firstly, we formulate the LF image compression problem as learning a disentangled LF representation network and an image encoding-decoding network. Secondly, we propose two novel feature extractors that leverage the structural prior of LF data by integrating features across different dimensions. Meanwhile, disentangled LF representation network is proposed to enhance the LF feature disentangling and decoupling. Thirdly, we propose the LFIC-DRASC for LF image compression, where two Asymmetrical Strip Convolution (ASC) operators, i.e. horizontal and vertical, are proposed to capture long-range correlation in LF feature space. These two ASC operators can be combined with the square convolution to further decouple LF features, which enhances the model ability in representing intricate spatial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LFIC-DRASC achieves an average of 20.5\% bit rate reductions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Selection of Sampling-Reconstruction in Fourier Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) has emerged to overcome the inefficiency of Nyquist sampling. However, traditional optimization-based reconstruction is slow and can not yield an exact image in practice. Deep learning-based reconstruction has been a promising alternative to optimization-based reconstruction, outperforming it in accuracy and computation speed. Finding an efficient sampling method with deep learning-based reconstruction, especially for Fourier CS remains a challenge. Existing joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction works (H1) optimize the sampling mask but have low potential as it is not adaptive to each data point. Adaptive sampling (H2) has also disadvantages of difficult optimization and Pareto sub-optimality. Here, we propose a novel adaptive selection of sampling-reconstruction (H1.5) framework that selects the best sampling mask and reconstruction network for each input data. We provide theorems that our method has a higher potential than H1 and effectively solves the Pareto sub-optimality problem in sampling-reconstruction by using separate reconstruction networks for different sampling masks. To select the best sampling mask, we propose to quantify the high-frequency Bayesian uncertainty of the input, using a super-resolution space generation model. Our method outperforms joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction (H1) and adaptive sampling (H2) by achieving significant improvements on several Fourier CS problems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation using Rein to Fine-tune Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in tumor segmentation within the field of digital pathology. However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

      <description>arXiv:2409.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Transcoding Vision Transformer (\modelname), a generative model designed to estimate high-resolution functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) samples from simultaneous Electroencephalography (EEG) data. A key feature of \modelname is its Domain Matching (DM) sub-module which effectively aligns the latent EEG representations with those of fMRI volumes, enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. Unlike previous methods that tend to struggle with fidelity and reproducibility of images, \modelname addresses these challenges by ensuring methodological integrity and higher-quality reconstructions which we showcase through extensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets; \modelname outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin in both cases, e.g. achieving a $10\times$ reduction in RMSE and a $3.14\times$ increase in SSIM on the Oddball dataset. An ablation study also provides insights into the contribution of each component to the model's overall effectiveness. This development is critical in offering a new approach to lessen the time and financial constraints typically linked with high-resolution brain imaging, thereby aiding in the swift and precise diagnosis of neurological disorders. Although it is not a replacement for actual fMRI but rather a step towards making such imaging more accessible, we believe that it represents a pivotal advancement in clinical practice and neuroscience research.

      <title>World of Forms: Deformable Geometric Templates for One-Shot Surface Meshing in Coronary CT Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation and surface mesh generation typically involve a sequential pipeline from image to segmentation to meshes, often requiring large training datasets while making limited use of prior geometric knowledge. This may lead to topological inconsistencies and suboptimal performance in low-data regimes. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient deep learning method for direct 3D anatomical object surface meshing using geometric priors. Our approach employs a multi-resolution graph neural network that operates on a prior geometric template which is deformed to fit object boundaries of interest. We show how different templates may be used for the different surface meshing targets, and introduce a novel masked autoencoder pretraining strategy for 3D spherical data. The proposed method outperforms nnUNet in a one-shot setting for segmentation of the pericardium, left ventricle (LV) cavity and the LV myocardium. Similarly, the method outperforms other lumen segmentation operating on multi-planar reformatted images. Results further indicate that mesh quality is on par with or improves upon marching cubes post-processing of voxel mask predictions, while remaining flexible in the choice of mesh triangulation prior, thus paving the way for more accurate and topologically consistent 3D medical object surface meshing.</description>

      <title>Tumor aware recurrent inter-patient deformable image registration of computed tomography scans with lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) for population level radiotherapy (RT) outcomes modeling requires topology preserving inter-patient deformable image registration (DIR) that preserves tumors on moving images while avoiding unrealistic deformations due to tumors occurring on fixed images. Purpose: We developed a tumor-aware recurrent registration (TRACER) deep learning (DL) method and evaluated its suitability for VBA. Methods: TRACER consists of encoder layers implemented with stacked 3D convolutional long short term memory network (3D-CLSTM) followed by decoder and spatial transform layers to compute dense deformation vector field (DVF). Multiple CLSTM steps are used to compute a progressive sequence of deformations. Input conditioning was applied by including tumor segmentations with 3D image pairs as input channels. Bidirectional tumor rigidity, image similarity, and deformation smoothness losses were used to optimize the network in an unsupervised manner. TRACER and multiple DL methods were trained with 204 3D CT image pairs from patients with lung cancers (LC) and evaluated using (a) Dataset I (N = 308 pairs) with DL segmented LCs, (b) Dataset II (N = 765 pairs) with manually delineated LCs, and (c) Dataset III with 42 LC patients treated with RT. Results: TRACER accurately aligned normal tissues. It best preserved tumors, blackindicated by the smallest tumor volume difference of 0.24\%, 0.40\%, and 0.13 \% and mean square error in CT intensities of 0.005, 0.005, 0.004, computed between original and resampled moving image tumors, for Datasets I, II, and III, respectively. It resulted in the smallest planned RT tumor dose difference computed between original and resampled moving images of 0.01 Gy and 0.013 Gy when using a female and a male reference.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</description>

      <title>Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet for lesion segmentation in PET/CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods, particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting, addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers (FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

      <title>multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However, due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS, which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy. The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction (TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.</description>

      <title>Pack my weights and run! Minimizing overheads for in-memory computing accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-memory computing hardware accelerators allow more than 10x improvements in peak efficiency and performance for matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) compared to conventional digital designs. For this, they have gained great interest for the acceleration of neural network workloads. Nevertheless, these potential gains are only achieved when the utilization of the computational resources is maximized and the overhead from loading operands in the memory array minimized. To this aim, this paper proposes a novel mapping algorithm for the weights in the IMC macro, based on efficient packing of the weights of network layers in the available memory. The algorithm realizes 1) minimization of weight loading times while at the same time 2) maximally exploiting the parallelism of the IMC computational fabric. A set of case studies are carried out to show achievable trade-offs for the MLPerf Tiny benchmark \cite{mlperftiny} on IMC architectures, with potential $10-100\times$ EDP improvements.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Decomposition and Error Margin Detection of Homodyned-K Distribution in Quantitative Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) parameter estimation in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been recently addressed using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.</description>

      <title>ABHINAW: A method for Automatic Evaluation of Typography within AI-Generated Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of Generative AI, platforms like MidJourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have transformed Text-to-Image (T2I) Generation. However, despite their impressive ability to create high-quality images, they often struggle to generate accurate text within these images. Theoretically, if we could achieve accurate text generation in AI images in a ``zero-shot'' manner, it would not only make AI-generated images more meaningful but also democratize the graphic design industry. The first step towards this goal is to create a robust scoring matrix for evaluating text accuracy in AI-generated images. Although there are existing bench-marking methods like CLIP SCORE and T2I-CompBench++, there's still a gap in systematically evaluating text and typography in AI-generated images, especially with diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation matrix designed explicitly for quantifying the performance of text and typography generation within AI-generated images. We have used letter by letter matching strategy to compute the exact matching scores from the reference text to the AI generated text. Our novel approach to calculate the score takes care of multiple redundancies such as repetition of words, case sensitivity, mixing of words, irregular incorporation of letters etc. Moreover, we have developed a Novel method named as brevity adjustment to handle excess text. In addition we have also done a quantitative analysis of frequent errors arise due to frequently used words and less frequently used words.

      <title>Computational Imaging for Long-Term Prediction of Solar Irradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occlusion of the sun by clouds is one of the primary sources of uncertainties in solar power generation, and is a factor that affects the wide-spread use of solar power as a primary energy source. Real-time forecasting of cloud movement and, as a result, solar irradiance is necessary to schedule and allocate energy across grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Previous works monitored cloud movement using wide-angle field of view imagery of the sky. However, such images have poor resolution for clouds that appear near the horizon, which reduces their effectiveness for long term prediction of solar occlusion. Specifically, to be able to predict occlusion of the sun over long time periods, clouds that are near the horizon need to be detected, and their velocities estimated precisely. To enable such a system, we design and deploy a catadioptric system that delivers wide-angle imagery with uniform spatial resolution of the sky over its field of view. To enable prediction over a longer time horizon, we design an algorithm that uses carefully selected spatio-temporal slices of the imagery using estimated wind direction and velocity as inputs. Using ray-tracing simulations as well as a real testbed deployed outdoors, we show that the system is capable of predicting solar occlusion as well as irradiance for tens of minutes in the future, which is an order of magnitude improvement over prior work.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Deep Learning for Glacier Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The more than 200,000 glaciers outside the ice sheets play a crucial role in our society by influencing sea-level rise, water resource management, natural hazards, biodiversity, and tourism. However, only a fraction of these glaciers benefit from consistent and detailed in-situ observations that allow for assessing their status and changes over time. This limitation can, in part, be overcome by relying on satellite-based Earth Observation techniques. Satellite-based glacier mapping applications have historically mainly relied on manual and semi-automatic detection methods, while recently, a fast and notable transition to deep learning techniques has started.
  This chapter reviews how combining multi-sensor remote sensing data and deep learning allows us to better delineate (i.e. map) glaciers and detect their temporal changes. We explain how relying on deep learning multi-sensor frameworks to map glaciers benefits from the extensive availability of regional and global glacier inventories. We also analyse the rationale behind glacier mapping, the benefits of deep learning methodologies, and the inherent challenges in integrating multi-sensor earth observation data with deep learning algorithms.
  While our review aims to provide a broad overview of glacier mapping efforts, we highlight a few setups where deep learning multi-sensor remote sensing applications have a considerable potential added value. This includes applications for debris-covered and rock glaciers that are visually difficult to distinguish from surroundings and for calving glaciers that are in contact with the ocean. These specific cases are illustrated through a series of visual imageries, highlighting some significant advantages and challenges when detecting glacier changes, including dealing with seasonal snow cover, changing debris coverage, and distinguishing glacier fronts from the surrounding sea ice.</description>

      <title>Residual Back Projection With Untrained Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Objective: The success of neural networks in a number of image processing tasks has motivated their application in image reconstruction problems in computed tomography (CT). While progress has been made in this area, the lack of stability and theoretical guarantees for accuracy, together with the scarcity of high-quality training data for specific imaging domains pose challenges for many CT applications. In this paper, we present a framework for iterative reconstruction (IR) in CT that leverages the hierarchical structure of neural networks, without the need for training. Our framework incorporates this structural information as a deep image prior (DIP), and uses a novel residual back projection (RBP) connection that forms the basis for our iterations.
  Methods: We propose using an untrained U-net in conjunction with a novel residual back projection to minimize an objective function and achieve high-accuracy reconstruction. In each iteration, the weights of the untrained U-net are optimized, and the output of the U-net in the current iteration is used to update the input of the U-net in the next iteration through the aforementioned RBP connection.
  Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the RBP-DIP framework offers improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional IR methods, as well as pre-trained and untrained models with similar network structures under multiple conditions. These improvements are particularly significant in the few-view, limited-angle, and low-dose imaging configurations.
  Conclusions: Applying to both parallel and fan beam X-ray imaging, our framework shows significant improvement under multiple conditions. Furthermore, the proposed framework requires no training data and can be adjusted on-demand to adapt to different conditions (e.g. noise level, geometry, and imaged object).</description>

      <title>NN-Copula-CD: A Copula-Guided Interpretable Neural Network for Change Detection in Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous remote sensing images has been widely used for disaster monitoring and land-use management. In the past decade, the heterogeneous CD problem has significantly benefited from the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the purely data-driven DNNs perform like a black box where the lack of interpretability limits the trustworthiness and controllability of DNNs in most practical CD applications. As a powerful knowledge-driven tool, copula theory performs well in modeling relationships among random variables. To enhance the interpretability of existing neural networks for CD, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD method based on a copula-guided neural network, named NN-Copula-CD. In our NN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of copula are employed as the loss functions to supervise a neural network to learn the dependence between bi-temporal heterogeneous superpixel pairs, and then the changed regions are identified via binary classification based on the degrees of dependence of all the superpixel pairs in the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experiments on three datasets with heterogeneous images, including optical, synthetic aperture radar, multispectral, and near-infrared images, where both quantitative and visual results demonstrate both the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed NN-Copula-CD method.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent from high-resolution satellite imagery plays a crucial role in disaster management such as damage assessment and relief activities. However, current state-of-the-art solutions are based on U-Net, which can-not segment the flood pixels accurately due to the ambiguous pixels (e.g., tree canopies, clouds) that prevent a direct judgement from only the spectral features. Thanks to the digital elevation model (DEM) data readily available from sources such as United States Geological Survey (USGS), this work explores the use of an elevation map to improve flood extent mapping. We propose, EvaNet, an elevation-guided segmentation model based on the encoder-decoder architecture with two novel techniques: (1) a loss function encoding the physical law of gravity that if a location is flooded (resp. dry), then its adjacent locations with a lower (resp. higher) elevation must also be flooded (resp. dry); (2) a new (de)convolution operation that integrates the elevation map by a location sensitive gating mechanism to regulate how much spectral features flow through adjacent layers. Extensive experiments show that EvaNet significantly outperforms the U-Net baselines, and works as a perfect drop-in replacement for U-Net in existing solutions to flood extent mapping.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Point Cloud Ground Segmentation: From Mechanical to Solid-State Lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel parallel processing method for point cloud ground segmentation, aimed at the technology evolution from mechanical to solid-state Lidar (SSL). We first benchmark point-based, grid-based, and range image-based ground segmentation algorithms using the SemanticKITTI dataset. Our results indicate that the range image-based method offers superior performance and robustness, particularly in resilience to frame slicing. Implementing the proposed algorithm on an FPGA demonstrates significant improvements in processing speed and scalability of resource usage. Additionally, we develop a custom dataset using camera-SSL equipment on our test vehicle to validate the effectiveness of the parallel processing approach for SSL frames in real world, achieving processing rates up to 30.9 times faster than CPU implementations. These findings underscore the potential of parallel processing strategies to enhance Lidar technologies for advanced perception tasks in autonomous vehicles and robotics. The data and code will be available post-publication on our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/WPI-APA-Lab/GroundSeg-Solid-State-Lidar-Parallel-Processing}</description>

      <title>A New Era in Computational Pathology: A Survey on Foundation and Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath). More specifically, it has altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. Deploying VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language be used as rich semantic information sources to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and its possible revolution through the use of FMs and VLMs in the future.</description>
