      <title>Energy-Efficient Approximate Full Adders Applying Memristive Serial IMPLY Logic For Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers and designers are facing problems with memory and power walls, considering the pervasiveness of Von-Neumann architecture in the design of processors and the problems caused by reducing the dimensions of deep sub-micron transistors. Memristive Approximate Computing (AC) and In-Memory Processing (IMP) can be promising solutions to these problems. We have tried to solve power and memory wall problems by presenting the implementation algorithm of four memristive approximate full adders applying the Material Implication (IMPLY) method. The proposed circuits reduce the number of computational steps by up to 40% compared to State-of-the-art (SOA). The energy consumption of the proposed circuits improves over the previous exact ones by 49%-75% and over the approximate full adders by up to 41%. Multiple error evaluation criteria evaluate the computational accuracy of the proposed approximate full adders in three scenarios in the 8-bit approximate adder structure. The proposed approximate full adders are evaluated in three image processing applications in three scenarios. The results of application-level simulation indicate that the four proposed circuits can be applied in all three scenarios, considering the acceptable image quality metrics of the output images (the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the output images is greater than 30 dB).</description>

      <title>On the Role of Communications for Space Domain Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) has become increasingly vital with the rapid growth of commercial space activities and the expansion of New Space. This paper stresses the necessity of transitioning from centralized to distributed SDA architectures. The current architecture predominantly relies on individual downhaul, which we propose to transition to on-orbit distribution. Our results demonstrate that the individual downhaul architecture does not scale efficiently with the increasing number of nodes, while on-orbit distribution offers significant improvements. By comparing the centralized architecture with the proposed distributed architecture, we highlight the advantages of enhanced coverage and resilience. Our findings show that on-orbit distribution greatly outperforms individual downhaul in terms of latency and scalability. Specifically, the latency results for on-orbit distribution are substantially lower and more consistent, even as the number of satellites increases. In addition, we address the inherent challenges associated with on-orbit distribution architecture, particularly cybersecurity concerns. We focus on link security to ensure the availability and integrity of data transmission in these advanced SDA systems. Future expectations include further refinement of on-orbit distribution strategies and the development of robust cybersecurity measures to support the scalability and resilience of SDA systems.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Transmitters Employing Cooperative Transmembrane Transport Proteins for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel optically controllable molecular communication (MC) transmitter (TX) design, which is based on a vesicular nanodevice (ND) functionalized for the release of signaling molecules via transmembrane proteins. Due to its optical-to-chemical conversion capability, the ND can be used as an externally controllable TX for several MC applications such as bit transmission and targeted drug delivery. The proposed TX design comprises two cooperating modules, an energizing module and a release module, and depending on the specific choices for the modules allows for the release of different types of signaling molecules. After setting up a general system model for the proposed TX design, we conduct a detailed mathematical analysis of a specific realization. In particular, we derive an exact analytical and an approximate closed-form solution for the concentration of the released signaling molecules and validate our results by comparison with a numerical solution. Moreover, we consider the impact of a buffering medium, which is typically present in experimental and application environments, in both our analytical and numerical analyses to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed TX design for practical chemical implementation. The proposed analytical and closed-form models facilitate system parameter optimization, which can accelerate the experimental development cycle of the proposed ND architecture in the future.</description>

      <title>Towards Long Range Detection of Elephants Using Seismic Signals; A Geophone-Sensor Interface for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-distance detection of the presence of elephants is pivotal to addressing the human-elephant conflict. IoT-based solutions utilizing seismic signals originating from the movement of elephants are a novel approach to solving this problem. This study introduces an instrumentation system comprising a specially designed geophone-sensor interface for non-invasive, long-range elephant detection using seismic waves while minimizing the vulnerability of seismic signals to noise. The geophone-sensor interface involves a cascade array of an instrumentation amplifier, a second-order Butterworth filter for signal filtering, and a signal amplifier. The introduced geophone-sensor interface was tested under laboratory conditions, and then real-world experiments were carried out for tamed, partly tamed, and untamed elephants. The experimental results reveal that the system remains stable within the tested frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 kHz and the temperature range of 10C to 40C. The system successfully captured the seismic signals generated by the footfalls of elephants within a maximum detection range of 155.6 m, with an overall detection accuracy of 99.5%.</description>

      <title>Highly Versatile FPGA-Implemented Cyber Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum Ising machines have drawn a lot of attention, but due to physical implementation constraints, it has been difficult to achieve dense coupling, such as full coupling with sufficient spins to handle practical large-scale applications. Consequently, classically computable equations have been derived from quantum master equations for these quantum Ising machines. Parallel implementations of these algorithms using FPGAs have been used to rapidly find solutions to these problems on a scale that is difficult to achieve in physical systems. We have developed an FPGA implemented cyber coherent Ising machine (cyber CIM) that is much more versatile than previous implementations using FPGAs. Our architecture is versatile since it can be applied to the open-loop CIM, which was proposed when CIM research began, to the closed-loop CIM, which has been used recently, as well as to Jacobi successive over-relaxation method. By modifying the sequence control code for the calculation control module, other algorithms such as Simulated Bifurcation (SB) can also be implemented. Earlier research on large-scale FPGA implementations of SB and CIM used binary or ternary discrete values for connections, whereas the cyber CIM used FP32 values. Also, the cyber CIM utilized Zeeman terms that were represented as FP32, which were not present in other large-scale FPGA systems. Our implementation with continuous interaction realizes N=4096 on a single FPGA, comparable to the single-FPGA implementation of SB with binary interactions, with N=4096. The cyber CIM enables applications such as CDMA multi-user detector and L0 compressed sensing which were not possible with earlier FPGA systems, while enabling superior calculation speeds, more than ten times faster than a GPU implementation. The calculation speed can be further improved by increasing parallelism, such as through clustering.</description>

      <title>PrivacyCube: Data Physicalization for Enhancing Privacy Awareness in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People are increasingly bringing Internet of Things (IoT) devices into their homes without understanding how their data is gathered, processed, and used. We describe PrivacyCube, a novel data physicalization designed to increase privacy awareness within smart home environments. PrivacyCube visualizes IoT data consumption by displaying privacy-related notices. PrivacyCube aims to assist smart home occupants to (i) understand their data privacy better and (ii) have conversations around data management practices of IoT devices used within their homes. Using PrivacyCube, households can learn and make informed privacy decisions collectively. To evaluate PrivacyCube, we used multiple research methods throughout the different stages of design. We first conducted a focus group study in two stages with six participants to compare PrivacyCube to text and state-of-the-art privacy policies. We then deployed PrivacyCube in a 14-day-long field study with eight households. Our results show that PrivacyCube helps home occupants comprehend IoT privacy better with significantly increased privacy awareness at p &lt; .05 (p=0.00041, t= -5.57). Participants preferred PrivacyCube over text privacy policies because it was comprehensive and easier to use. PrivacyCube and Privacy Label, a state-of-the-art approach, both received positive reviews from participants, with PrivacyCube being preferred for its interactivity and ability to encourage conversations. PrivacyCube was also considered by home occupants as a piece of home furniture, encouraging them to socialize and discuss IoT privacy implications using this device.</description>

      <title>PriviFy: Designing Tangible Interfaces for Configuring IoT Privacy Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart speakers can collect sensitive user data, necessitating the need for users to manage their privacy preferences. However, configuring these preferences presents users with multiple challenges. Existing privacy controls often lack transparency, are hard to understand, and do not provide meaningful choices. On top of that, users struggle to locate privacy settings due to multiple menus or confusing labeling, which discourages them from using these controls. We introduce PriviFy (Privacy Simplify-er), a novel and user-friendly tangible interface that can simplify the configuration of smart devices privacy settings. PriviFy is designed to propose an enhancement to existing hardware by integrating additional features that improve privacy management. We envision that positive feedback and user experiences from our study will inspire consumer product developers and smart device manufacturers to incorporate the useful design elements we have identified. Using fidelity prototyping, we iteratively designed PriviFy prototype with 20 participants to include interactive features such as knobs, buttons, lights, and notifications that allow users to configure their data privacy preferences and receive confirmation of their choices. We further evaluated PriviFy high-fidelity prototype with 20 more participants. Our results show that PriviFy helps simplify the complexity of privacy preferences configuration with a significant usability score at p &lt; .05 (P = 0.000000017, t = -8.8639). PriviFy successfully met users privacy needs and enabled them to regain control over their data. We conclude by recommending the importance of designing specific privacy configuration options.</description>

      <title>Physically-Consistent Modeling and Optimization of Non-local RIS-Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual Coupling (MC) emerges as an inherent feature in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), particularly, when they are fabricated with sub-wavelength inter-element spacing. Hence, any physically-consistent model of the RIS operation needs to accurately describe MC-induced effects. In addition, the design of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) transmit/receive radiation patterns constitutes another critical factor for efficient RIS operation. The latter two factors lead naturally to the emergence of non-local RIS structures, whose operation can be effectively described via non-diagonal phase shift matrices. In this paper, we focus on jointly optimizing MC and the radiation patterns in multi-user MIMO communication systems assisted by non-local RISs, which are modeled via the scattering parameters. We particularly present a novel problem formulation for the joint optimization of MC, radiation patterns, and the active and passive beamforming in a physically-consistent manner, considering either reflective or transmissive RIS setups. Differently from the current approaches that design the former two parameters on the fly, we present an offline optimization method which is solved for both considered RIS functionalities. Our extensive simulation results, using both parametric and geometric channel models, showcase the validity of the proposed optimization framework over benchmark schemes, indicating that improved performance is achievable without the need for optimizing MC and the radiation patterns of the RIS on the fly, which can be rather cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Wireless Networks via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs): Overview of the ETSI ISG RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are a novel form of ultra-low power devices that are capable to increase the communication data rates as well as the cell coverage in a cost- and energy-efficient way. This is attributed to their programmable operation that enables them to dynamically manipulate the wireless propagation environment, a feature that has lately inspired numerous research investigations and applications. To pave the way to the formal standardization of RISs, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) launched the Industry Specification Group (ISG) on the RIS technology in September 2021. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the status of the work conducted by the ETSI ISG RIS, covering typical deployment scenarios of reconfigurable metasurfaces, use cases and operating applications, requirements, emerging hardware architectures and operating modes, as well as the latest insights regarding future directions of RISs and the resulting smart wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Predictors of the Sense of Presence in an Immersive Audio Storytelling Experience, a Mixed Methods Study. PREPRINT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examined which variables predicted the sense of presence (being there) in an immersive audio experience, with a focus on the impacts of immersion technology (headphones with spatialised sound versus speaker with 2D stereo sound), the nature of the audio experience, the narrative content, participants emotional and cognitive engagement and personal characteristics such as age and gender. Museum visitors listened to a story on the One Story, Many Voices immersive audio installation. A convergent mixed-methods design was used, including multiple regression analysis of survey data (n 185) and relational analysis of interview data (n 9). This study found mixed methods support from both surveys and interviews to suggest that presence was predicted by the audio quality (especially the audio being perceived as different from other audio stories they had listened to in the past), cognitive engagement (especially being totally absorbed), the narrative (the story and how it was told) and some support was found for emotional engagement (especially feeling a connection with the storyteller). Effects of the environment and immersion technology on presence received only either quantitative or qualitative support. No influences of personal characteristics were found. Findings are relevant for academics, immersive experience (XR) commissioners and developers.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bottlenecks of NISQ-friendly HHL algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises enabling solving large problem instances, e.g. large linear equation systems with HHL algorithm, once the hardware stack matures. For the foreseeable future quantum computing will remain in the so-called NISQ era, in which the algorithms need to account for the flaws of the hardware such as noise. In this work, we perform an empirical study to test scaling properties and directly related noise resilience of the the most resources-intense component of the HHL algorithm, namely QPE and its NISQ-adaptation Iterative QPE. We explore the effectiveness of noise mitigation techniques for these algorithms and investigate whether we can keep the gate number low by enforcing sparsity constraints on the input or using circuit optimization techniques provided by Qiskit package. Our results indicate that currently available noise mitigation techniques, such as Qiskit readout and Mthree readout packages, are insufficient for enabling results recovery even in the small instances tested here. Moreover, our results indicate that the scaling of these algorithms with increase in precision seems to be the most substantial obstacle. These insights allowed us to deduce an approximate bottleneck for algorithms that consider a similar time evolution as QPE. Such observations provide evidence of weaknesses of such algorithms on NISQ devices and help us formulate meaningful future research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equilibrium Propagation for efficient training of quantum systems based on Onsager reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in all branches of science and technology has created a need for energy-efficient, alternative hardware platforms. While such neuromorphic approaches have been proposed and realised for a wide range of platforms, physically extracting the gradients required for training remains challenging as generic approaches only exist in certain cases. Equilibrium propagation (EP) is such a procedure that has been introduced and applied to classical energy-based models which relax to an equilibrium. Here, we show a direct connection between EP and Onsager reciprocity and exploit this to derive a quantum version of EP. This can be used to optimize loss functions that depend on the expectation values of observables of an arbitrary quantum system. Specifically, we illustrate this new concept with supervised and unsupervised learning examples in which the input or the solvable task is of quantum mechanical nature, e.g., the recognition of quantum many-body ground states, quantum phase exploration, sensing and phase boundary exploration. We propose that in the future quantum EP may be used to solve tasks such as quantum phase discovery with a quantum simulator even for Hamiltonians which are numerically hard to simulate or even partially unknown. Our scheme is relevant for a variety of quantum simulation platforms such as ion chains, superconducting qubit arrays, neutral atom Rydberg tweezer arrays and strongly interacting atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Generalized "Square roots of Not" matrices, their application to the unveiling of hidden logical operators and to the definition of fully matrix circular Euler functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Linear Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact. Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
  At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration, highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields, and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.</description>
