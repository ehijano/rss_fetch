      <title>CHEOPS in-flight performance: A comprehensive look at the first 3.5 years of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CHEOPS is a space telescope specifically designed to monitor transiting exoplanets orbiting bright stars. In September 2023, CHEOPS completed its nominal mission and remains in excellent operational conditions. The mission has been extended until the end of 2026. Scientific and instrumental data have been collected throughout in-orbit commissioning and nominal operations, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the mission's performance. In this article, we present the results of this analysis with a twofold goal. First, we aim to inform the scientific community about the present status of the mission and what can be expected as the instrument ages. Secondly, we intend for this publication to serve as a legacy document for future missions, providing insights and lessons learned from the successful operation of CHEOPS. To evaluate the instrument performance in flight, we developed a comprehensive monitoring and characterisation programme. It consists of dedicated observations that allow us to characterise the instrument's response. In addition to the standard collection of nominal science and housekeeping data, these observations provide input for detecting, modelling, and correcting instrument systematics, discovering and addressing anomalies, and comparing the instrument's actual performance with expectations. The precision of the CHEOPS measurements has enabled the mission objectives to be met and exceeded. Careful modelling of the instrumental systematics allows the data quality to be significantly improved during the light curve analysis phase, resulting in more precise scientific measurements. CHEOPS is compliant with the driving scientific requirements of the mission. Although visible, the ageing of the instrument has not affected the mission's performance.</description>

      <title>Imputation of Missing Photometric Data and Photometric Redshift Estimation for CSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation requires support from multi-band observational data. However, in the actual process of astronomical observations and data processing, some sources may have missing observational data in certain bands for various reasons. This could greatly affect the accuracy and reliability of photo-$z$ estimation for these sources, and even render some estimation methods unusable. The same situation may exist for the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). In this study, we employ a deep learning method called Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) to impute the missing photometric data in CSST, aiming to reduce the impact of data missing on photo-$z$ estimation and improve estimation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that using the GAIN technique can effectively fill in the missing photometric data in CSST. Particularly, when the data missing rate is below 30\%, the imputation of photometric data exhibits high accuracy, with higher accuracy in the $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$ bands compared to the $NUV$ and $u$ bands. After filling in the missing values, the quality of photo-$z$ estimation obtained by the widely used Easy and Accurate Zphot from Yale (EAZY) software is notably enhanced. Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of photo-$z$ estimation, including the catastrophic outlier fraction ($f_{out}$), the normalized median absolute deviation ($\rm {\sigma_{NMAD}}$), and the bias of photometric redshift ($bias$), all show some degree of improvement. Our research will help maximize the utilization of observational data and provide a new method for handling sample missing values for applications that require complete photometry data to produce results.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$ sq. deg. of the sky at $\approx 1-3$ night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$ Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on the 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$ million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$ mag, with a total of $\approx 50$ billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$ billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example Python notebooks for users. This catalog is the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Managing the Growing Complexity of Multi-Messenger Transient Events with Astro-COLIBRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of transient phenomena, such as GRBs, FRBs, novae/supernovae explosions, coupled with the detection of cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, have transformed astrophysics. Maximizing the discovery potential necessitates tools for swiftly acquiring an overview of the most relevant information for each new detection. Introducing Astro-COLIBRI, a comprehensive platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI features a public API, real-time databases and alert systems, a discussion forum, and a website and iOS/Android apps as user clients. In real time, it evaluates incoming astronomical observation messages from all available alert streams, filters them based on user-defined criteria, and contextualizes them in the multi-wavelength (MWL) and multi-messenger (MM) context. User clients offer a graphical representation, providing a succinct summary for quick identification of interesting phenomena and assessing observing conditions globally.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Studies of Detector Yield and Readout Noise From the First Large-Scale Deployment of Microwave Multiplexing at the Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory is a new ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, which is currently being commissioned in Chile's Atacama Desert. During its survey, the observatory's small aperture telescopes will map 10% of the sky in bands centered at frequencies ranging from 27 to 280 GHz to constrain cosmic inflation models, and its large aperture telescope will map 40% of the sky in the same bands to constrain cosmological parameters and use weak lensing to study large-scale structure. To achieve these science goals, the Simons Observatory is deploying these telescopes' receivers with 60,000 state-of-the-art superconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers for its first five year survey. Reading out this unprecedented number of cryogenic sensors, however, required the development of a novel readout system. The SMuRF electronics were developed to enable high-density readout of superconducting sensors using cryogenic microwave SQUID multiplexing technology. The commissioning of the SMuRF systems at the Simons Observatory is the largest deployment to date of microwave multiplexing technology for transition-edge sensors. In this paper, we show that a significant fraction of the systems deployed so far to the Simons Observatory's large aperture telescope meet baseline specifications for detector yield and readout noise in this early phase of commissioning.</description>

      <title>CCAT: FYST Prime-Cam Readout Software: A framework for massively scalable KID arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the development of the readout software for the Prime-Cam and Mod-Cam instruments on the CCAT Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), primecam_readout. The instruments feature lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (LEKID) arrays driven by Xilinx ZCU111 RFSoC boards. In the current configuration, each board can drive up to 4000 KIDs, and Prime-Cam is implementing approximately 25 boards. The software runs on a centralized control computer connected to the boards via dedicated ethernet, and facilitates such tasks as frequency-multiplexed tone comb driving, comb calibration and optimization, and detector timestream establishment. The control computer utilizes dynamically generated control channels for each board, allowing for simultaneous parallel control over all, while uniquely tracking diagnostics for each. This work demonstrates a scalable RFSoC readout architecture where computational demands increase linearly with the number of detectors, enabling control of tens-of-thousands of KIDs with modest hardware, and opening the door to the next generation of KID arrays housing millions of detectors.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$: the GOTO project for real-time citizen science in time-domain astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics continues to grow rapidly, with the inception of new surveys drastically increasing data volumes. Democratised, distributed approaches to training sets for machine learning classifiers are crucial to make the most of this torrent of discovery -- with citizen science approaches proving effective at meeting these requirements. In this paper, we describe the creation of and the initial results from the $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ citizen science project, built to find transient phenomena from the GOTO telescopes in near real-time. $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ launched in July 2023 and received over 600,000 classifications from approximately 2,000 volunteers over the course of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a observing run. During this time, the project has yielded 20 discoveries, generated a `gold-standard' training set of 17,682 detections for augmenting deep-learned classifiers, and measured the performance and biases of Zooniverse volunteers on real-bogus classification. This project will continue throughout the lifetime of GOTO, pushing candidates at ever-greater cadence, and directly facilitate the next-generation classification algorithms currently in development.</description>

      <title>WST -- Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: design of a new 12m class telescope dedicated to widefield Multi-object and Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide-Field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is a concept for a 12-m class seeing-limited telescope providing two concentric fields of view for simultaneous Multi-Object Spectroscopy and Integral Field Spectroscopy. The specified wavelength range is 0.35-1.6 microns. The baseline optical design relies on a corrected Cassegrain solution feeding Multi-Object spectrographs through fibres, while the central area of the field is propagated down to a gravity-stable Integral Field Station housing 144 spectrographs. The Cassegrain corrector also provides for atmospheric dispersion compensation. All optical components are within commercially available dimensions. With a view to minimizing risks and costs, to the maximum possible extent the telescope relies on proven subsystem solutions. An exception is the tip-tilt secondary mirror, which would likely have to provide some rejection of wind shake. An iteration of the optical design is ongoing, with a view to mitigating the weaknesses of the first baseline design. The telescope would be wavefront-controlled on-sky at the common-path MOS focus. Controls in the IFS path will need to compensate for the effect of subsequent differentials - wavefront and line of sight. There is no shortage of degrees of freedom and metrology solution to do so. The size of the dome is driven by the Nasmyth footprint and the height of the pier, which houses the IFS station. The baseline assumption is that a VLT-like enclosure would provide suitable shielding and ventilation.</description>

      <title>A fast neural emulator for interstellar chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrochemical models are important tools to interpret observations of molecular and atomic species in different environments. However, these models are time-consuming, precluding a thorough exploration of the parameter space, leading to uncertainties and biased results. Using neural networks to simulate the behavior of astrochemical models is a way to circumvent this problem, providing fast calculations that are based on real astrochemical models. In this paper, we present a fast neural emulator of the astrochemical code Nautilus based on conditional neural fields. The resulting model produces the abundance of 192 species for arbitrary times between 1 and 10$^7$ years. Uncertainties well below 0.2 dex are found for all species, while the computing time is of the order of 10$^4$ smaller than Nautilus. This will open up the possibility of performing much more complex forward models to better understand the physical properties of the interstellar medium. As an example of the power of these models, we ran a feature importance analysis on the electron abundance predicted by Nautilus. We found that the electron density is coupled to the initial sulphur abundance in a low density gas. Increasing the initial sulphur abundance from a depleted scenario to the cosmic abundance leads to an enhancement of an order of magnitude of the electron density. This enhancement can potentially influence the dynamics of the gas in star formation sites.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Voronoi Tessellations to Determine Radial Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel method of determining 2D radial density profiles for astronomical systems of discrete objects using Voronoi tessellations. This Voronoi-based method was tested against the standard annulus-based method on 5 simulated systems of objects, following known Hubble density profiles of varying parameters and sizes. It was found that the Voronoi-based method returned radial density fits with lower uncertainties on the fitting parameters across all 5 systems compared to the annulus-based method. The Voronoi-based method also consistently returned more accurate estimates of the total number of objects in each system than the annulus-based method, and this accuracy increased with increasing system size. Finally, the Voronoi-based method was applied to two observed globular cluster systems around brightest cluster galaxies ESO 444-G046 and 2MASX J13272961-3123237 and the results were compared to previous results for these galaxies obtained with the annulus-based method. Again, it was found that the Voronoi-based method returned fits with lower uncertainties on the fitting parameters, and the total number of globular clusters returned are within errors of the annulus-based method estimates, however also with lower uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Use the 4S (Signal-Safe Speckle Subtraction): Explainable Machine Learning reveals the Giant Exoplanet AF Lep b in High-Contrast Imaging Data from 2011</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of exoplanet high-contrast imaging (HCI) is to separate the signal of exoplanets from their host stars, which are many orders of magnitude brighter. HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by speckle noise originating from perturbations in the Earth's atmosphere and imperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques are used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal. Often, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally subtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable machine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal for one of the most used post-processing methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function for high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures not only the speckle noise, but also the characteristic shape of the planet signal. Building upon these insights, we develop a new post-processing method (4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our model to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band and find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is largest at close separations to the star ($\leq 4 \lambda /D$) providing up to 1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast. This enhancement enables us to detect the exoplanet AF Lep b in data from 2011, 11 years before its subsequent discovery. We present updated orbital parameters for this object.</description>

      <title>Deriving the size and shape of the ALBA electron beam with optical synchrotron radiation interferometry using aperture masks: technical choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore non-redundant aperture masking to derive the size and shape of the ALBA synchrotron light source at optical wavelengths using synchrotron radiation interferometry. We show that non-redundant masks are required due to phase fluctuations arising within the experimental set-up. We also show, using closure phase, that the phase fluctuations are factorizable into element-based errors. We employ multiple masks, including 2, 3, 5, and 6 hole configurations. We develop a process for self-calibration of the element-based amplitudes (square root of flux through the aperture), which corrects for non-uniform illumination over the mask, in order to derive visibility coherences and phases, from which the source size and shape can be derived. We explore the optimal procedures to obtain the most reliable results with the 5-hole mask, based on the temporal scatter in measured coherences and closure phases. We find that the closure phases are very stable, and close to zero (within $2^o$). Through uv-modeling, we consider the noise properties of the experiment and conclude that our visibility measurements per frame are likely accurate to an rms scatter of $\sim 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the combined arm- and cavity-locking system for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser frequency noise suppression is a critical requirement for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission to detect gravitational waves. The baseline laser stabilization is achieved using cavity pre-stabilization and a post-processing technique called Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI). To enhance the margins for TDI, alternate laser locking schemes should be investigated. A novel stabilisation blending the excellent stability of the arm with the existing cavity reference has been shown theoretically to meet the first-generation TDI margins. This locking system was designed to be implemented as a firmware change and have minimal or no changes to the LISA hardware. This paper experimentally verifies the hybrid laser locking technique by utilizing two references - an optical cavity, and an interferometer with delay imparted using 10 km of optical fiber. The results indicate the viability of the combination of arm-cavity locking system for LISA. They show the key benefits envisioned by this technique; suppression of the cavity fluctuations by the arm sensor (by 21 dB in this demonstration) and reduction of Doppler pulling of the laser frequency, a key technical challenge for arm locking.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Lichen-Mediated Self-Growing Construc8on Materials for Habitat Outfitting on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As its next step in space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. To build the centrally located, monolithic habitat, NASA has a history of experimenting with lightweight inflatable habitats to reduce mass and volume. However, the physical structures used to outfit the inflatable must generally be launched by a second spacecraft. This study proposes that, rather than shipping prefabricated outfitting elements to Mars, habitat outfitting can be realized by in-situ construction using cyanobacteria and fungi as building agents. A synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, can be created to produce abundant biominerals (CaCO3) and biopolymers, which will glue Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into various structures, such as floors, walls, partitions, and furniture.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Kilopixel Silicon Microlens Arrays for Future Far-Infrared Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future far-infrared astrophysics observatories will require focal plane arrays containing thousands of ultra-sensitive, superconducting detectors, each of which needs to be optically coupled to the telescope. At longer wavelengths, many approaches have been developed including feedhorn arrays and macroscopic arrays of lenslets. However, with wavelengths as short as 25 microns, optical coupling in the far-infrared remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fabricating far-infrared monolithic silicon microlens arrays using grayscale lithography and deep reactive ion etching. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the microlens arrays are discussed. We compare the designed and fabricated lens profile, and calculate that the fabricated lenses will achieve 84% encircled power for the designed detector, which is only 3% less than the designed performance. We also present methods developed for anti-reflection coating microlens arrays and for a silicon-to-silicon die bonding process to hybridize microlens arrays with detector arrays.</description>

      <title>Ground-based image deconvolution with Swin Transformer UNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As ground-based all-sky astronomical surveys will gather millions of images in the coming years, a critical requirement emerges for the development of fast deconvolution algorithms capable of efficiently improving the spatial resolution of these images. By successfully recovering clean and high-resolution images from these surveys, the objective is to deepen the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution through accurate photometric measurements. We introduce a two-step deconvolution framework using a Swin Transformer architecture. Our study reveals that the deep learning-based solution introduces a bias, constraining the scope of scientific analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel third step relying on the active coefficients in the sparsity wavelet framework. We conducted a performance comparison between our deep learning-based method and Firedec, a classical deconvolution algorithm, based on an analysis of a subset of the EDisCS cluster samples. We demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of resolution recovery, generalisation to different noise properties, and computational efficiency. The analysis of this cluster sample not only allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method, but it also enabled us to quantify the number of clumps within these galaxies in relation to their disc colour. This robust technique that we propose holds promise for identifying structures in the distant universe through ground-based images.</description>

      <title>A 4-8 GHz Kinetic Inductance Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifier Using Four-Wave Mixing with Near Quantum-Limit Noise Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPA) have a wide instantaneous bandwidth with near quantum-limited performance and a relatively high dynamic range. Because of this, they are suitable readout devices for cryogenic detectors and superconducting qubits and have a variety of applications in quantum sensing. This work discusses the design, fabrication, and performance of a KI-TWPA based on four-wave mixing in a NbTiN microstrip transmission line. This device amplifies a signal band from 4 to 8~GHz without contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an amplifier-added noise of $ 0.5 \leq N_{added} \leq 1.5$ photons from 4.5 - 8 GHz.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. Localizing EMRIs by GW detectors can help us select candidate host galaxies, which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we demonstrate that the localization information can also be used to infer the formation channel of EMRIs, and hence allow us to extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions. By conducting mock observations of the EMRIs which can be detected by TianQin and LISA, as well as the galaxies which can be provided by the future Chinese Space Station Telescope, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of $\sim3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to $\sim10\%-40\%$. The TianQin+LISA network, by increasing the localization accuracy, can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to $\sim0.4\%-7\%$ and $\sim4\%-20\%$, respectively. Then, considering an illustrative case in which all EMRIs originate in AGNs, and combining the mock EMRI observation with a mock AGN catalog, we show that TianQin can recognize the EMRI-AGN correlation with $\sim 1300$ detections. The TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to $\sim 30$. Additionally, we propose a statistical method to directly estimate the fraction of EMRIs produced in AGNs, $f_{\rm agn}$, and show that observationally deriving this value could significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN surveys to improve the constraints on cosmological parameters and the formation channel of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend evaluating the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exoplanet Ephemerides by Leveraging Professional and Citizen Science Data: A Test Case with WASP-77A b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated ephemeris and physical parameters for the exoplanet WASP-77 A b. In this effort, we combine 64 ground- and space-based transit observations, 6 space-based eclipse observations, and 32 radial velocity observations to produce the most precise orbital solution to date for this target, aiding in the planning of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel observations and atmospheric studies. We report a new orbital period of 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days, a new mid-transit time of 2459957.337860 +- 4.3e-5 BJDTDB (Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time scale; arXiv:1005.4415) and a new mid-eclipse time of 2459956.658192 +- 6.7e-5 BJDTDB. Furthermore, the methods presented in this study reduce the uncertainties in the planet mass to 1.6654 +- 4.5e-3 Mjup and orbital period to 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days by factors of 15.1 and 10.9, respectively. Through a joint fit analysis comparison of transit data taken by space-based and citizen science-led initiatives, our study demonstrates the power of including data collected by citizen scientists compared to a fit of the space-based data alone. Additionally, by including a vast array of citizen science data from ExoClock, Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and Exoplanet Watch, we can increase our observational baseline and thus acquire better constraints on the forward propagation of our ephemeris than what is achievable with TESS data alone.</description>
