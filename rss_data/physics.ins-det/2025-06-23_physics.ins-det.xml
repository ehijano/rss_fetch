      <title>A facility for thermo-mechanical characterization of fusion magnet materials during cryogenic ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial fusion power plants demand magnet materials that retain structural integrity and thermal conductivity while operating under the bombardment of energetic neutrons at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding how thermo-mechanical properties evolve under such extreme loads is crucial for selecting materials with high radiation tolerance and predictable failure mechanisms. Presented here is a facility that combines cryogenic transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) with simultaneous ion irradiation, enabling in-situ measurements of thermal diffusivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency spectra. Employing copper as a benchmark material, an irradiation was performed at 30 K with 12.4 MeV $\text{Cu}^{6+}$ ions producing a final fluence of $1.9 \times 10^{17}$ ions/m$^2$. Over the irradiation period, thermal diffusivity nearly halved from an initial value of $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ while SAW speed did not show significant change, maintaining a value of $2162\pm18$ m/s. Given its real-time monitoring capability and the numerous candidate materials that remain uncharacterized under fusion magnet operating conditions, this facility is poised to deliver new scientific insights into fusion magnet material degradation trends, contributing to improved design criteria and operational certainty for forthcoming fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties of a Spherical Magnetic Field Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical harmonic expansions are well-established tools for estimating magnetic fields from surface measurements and are widely used in applications such as tomographic imaging, geomagnetism, and biomagnetism. Although the mathematical foundations of these expansions are well understood, the impact of real-world imperfections, on the uncertainty of the field model has received little attention. In this work, we present a systematic uncertainty propagation analysis for a magnetic field camera that estimates the field from surface measurements using a spherical array of Hall magnetometers arranged in a spherical t-design. A Monte Carlo-based approach is employed to quantify how sensor-related uncertainties, such as calibration errors and positioning inaccuracies, affect the spatial distribution of the estimated field's uncertainty. The results offer insights into the robustness of spherical harmonic methods and help identify the dominant sources of uncertainty in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>An array of bulk-acoustic-wave sensors as a high-frequency antenna for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their simplest form, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices consist of a piezoelectric crystal between two electrodes that transduce the material's vibrations into electrical signals. They are adopted in frequency control and metrology, with well-established standards at frequencies of 5~MHz and above. Their use as a resonant-mass strain antenna for high-frequency gravitational waves has been recently proposed (Goryachev and Tobar, 2014). The estimated power spectral density sensitivity at the resonant frequencies is of the order of $10^{-21}\, \textrm{strain}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$. In this paper, after introducing the science opportunity and potential of gravitational wave detection with BAWs, we describe the two-stage BAUSCIA project plan to build a multimode antenna based on commercial BAWs, followed by an optimized array of custom BAWs. We show that commercially available BAWs already provide sensitivity comparable to current experiments around 10~MHz. Finally, we outline options for optimization of custom devices to improve sensitivity in an unexplored region, probe multiple frequencies between 0.1 and 10 MHz, and target specific signals, such as post-merger emission from neutron stars or emission from various dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Development of Thin-Gap GEM-{\mu}RWELL Hybrid Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) are used for tracking in High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics because of their large area, excellent spatial resolution capabilities and low cost. However, for high energy charged particles impacting at a large angle with respect to the axis perpendicular to detector plane, the spatial resolution degrades significantly because of the long trail of ionization charges produced in clusters all along the track in the drift region of the detector. The long ionization charge trail results in registering hits from large number of strips in the readout plane which makes it challenging to precisely reconstruct the particle position using simple center of gravity algorithm. As a result, the larger the drift gap, the more severe the deterioration of spatial resolution for inclined tracks. For the same reason, the position resolution is also severely degraded in a large magnetic field, where the Lorentz E {\times} B effect causes the ionization charges to follow a curved and longer path in the detector gas volume. In this paper, we report on the development of thin-gap MPGDs as a way to maintain excellent spatial resolution capabilities of MPGD detectors over a wide angular range of incoming particles. In a thin-gap MPGD, the thickness of the gas volume in the drift region is reduced from typically {\sim} 3 mm to {\sim} 1 mm or less. We present preliminary test beam results demonstrating the improvement in spatial resolution from {\sim} 400 {\mu}m with a standard 3 mm gap {\mu}RWELL prototype to {\sim} 140 {\mu}m with a double amplification GEM-{\mu}RWELL thin-gap hybrid detector. We also discuss the impact of a thin-gap drift volume on other aspects of the performance of MPGD technologies such as the efficiency and detector stability.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions (IRFs). Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The presented methodology is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <title>New modeling of the stray light noise in the main arms of the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stray light represents a significant noise source for gravitational wave detectors, requiring an accurate modeling and mitigation to preserve the experiment's sensitivity. In this article, we present an updated and improved analysis of the stray-light induced noise in the Einstein Telescope main arm. The results presented here supersede previous studies taking into account a number of improvements, including baffle clipping effects, new numerical calculations for computing diffraction contributions and the influence of baffle edge serrations. Results are presented for both triangular and L-shaped configurations for the experiment. Furthermore, in the case of the triangular configuration, we examine non-ideal optical cavity conditions, such as beam offsets and misalignments, and the presence of point absorbers in the mirrors, which can increase scattered light noise. This can be translated into future stringent constraints on the design and operating parameters of the interferometer, thus facilitating to achieve its sensitivity targets.</description>

      <title>Concept of the UCN Source at the WWR-K Reactor (AlSUN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the concept of the ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a superfluid helium-4 converter located in the thermal column of the WWR-K research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The conceptual design is based on the idea of accumulating UCNs in the source and effectively transporting them to experimental setups. We propose to improve the UCN density in the source by separating the heat and the UCN flows from the production volume and decreasing both, the temperature of the SuperFluid $ ^{ 4 }$He (SF $ ^{ 4 }$He) converter below $\sim$1 K and the coefficient of UCN wall loss below $\sim$$ 10^{ -4 }$. To achieve the operation temperatures below 1 K we plan to use a He-3 pumping cryogenic system and minimize the thermal load on the UCN accumulation trap walls. Additional gain in the total number of accumulated UCNs can be achieved due to use of a material of a high critical velocity for the walls of the accumulation trap. The implementation of such a design critically depends on the availability of materials with specific UCN and cryogenic properties. This paper describes the conceptual design of the source, discusses its implementation methods and material requirements, and plans for material testing studies.</description>

      <title>On the Particle Image Overlap in Single Camera Defocusing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle image (PI) overlap presents a significant challenge in single-camera particle tracking and sizing techniques such as Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry (DPTV) and Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI). In DPTV, overlap obscures PI boundaries, complicating the detection and accurate estimation of PI diameter and center position, which increases uncertainty in the reconstructed particle positions. In IPI, overlap reduces the usable area of the interference pattern, limiting the accuracy of particle size determination. This study introduces a statistical model to quantify PI overlap independently from the optical setup, source density, or PI size. The model assumes uniformly distributed, uniformly sized circular PIs and is validated against experimental data featuring non-uniform sizes and mild astigmatism (up to aspect ratios of 1.66), demonstrating strong agreement. The present study reveals that the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$ serves as a strong universal scaling parameter for PI overlap. Key overlap metrics, including the number of overlaps per PI, the fraction of overlap-free PIs, and the usable PI area are analyzed as functions of the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$. The results reveal a critical threshold at $\mathcal{S} = 0.25$, where each PI experiences, on average, one overlap. The study provides practical guidance for experimental design by linking overlap metrics to controllable parameters such as source density, defocus length, and aperture diameter. The presented models serve as lookup tools to help experimenters maintain PI overlap within acceptable limits, enabling more reliable and quantitatively robust measurements in DPTV and IPI applications.</description>

      <title>Detection of subsurface structures with a vehicle-based atom gravity gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</description>

      <title>A new beamline for Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers (REBEL) and Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments (STRIPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two newly constructed experimental setups - REBEL (Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers) and STRIPE (Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments) - integrated into a single offline beamline at KU Leuven. REBEL is designed for collinear laser spectroscopy of ion bunches following isobaric separation with a multireflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer, enabling high-sensitivity measurements of mass-selected fast-ion beams. In contrast, STRIPE focuses on the deceleration, trapping, and laser cooling of ions in a segmented linear Paul trap, optimized for long interrogation times and precision spectroscopy. The shared infrastructure features stable high-voltage operation ($&lt;10$ ppm), modular vacuum sections, and a fast-beam switchyard to route ions to either experiment. Initial results include a mass-resolving power of $R \approx 12900$ in REBEL and successful ion trapping and laser cooling of ions with a kinetic energy of 10 keV in STRIPE, with improved performance achieved using a frequency-modulated cooling laser. This dual-system platform enables the development and benchmarking of advanced spectroscopy and trapping techniques and is compatible with future operation at radioactive ion beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Large volume 'chunk' lift out for 3D tomographic analysis using analytical plasma focussed ion beam -- scanning electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.</description>

      <title>Search for dark-matter axions beyond the quantum limit: the Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firmly established in astrophysical observations, dark matter evades direct detection in experiments. Axions and axion-like particles are among the leading dark-matter candidates, and numerous attempts to detect them in laboratories have been performed. Here, we propose to advance these efforts substantially, extending the sensitivity for dark-matter axions in the mass range $(38-54)~\mu$eV down to the axion-photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\lesssim \left(10^{-14}-10^{-15}\right)$ GeV$^{-1}$, motivated by generic models of Quantum Chromodynamics axion. Single-photon detectors operating at ultra-low temperatures are key elements of the experiment. The projected sensitivity will be reached in one year of data taking with magnetic field of $(1-10)$ T, making Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) the most sensitive haloscope in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Resolution Limiting Factors in Low-Energy Cascade Zenith Angle Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory includes low energy extensions such as the existing DeepCore subarray and the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which will consist of seven new strings of photosensors with denser instrumentation than the existing array. The setup will allow for the study of neutrino oscillations with greater sensitivity compared to the existing instrumentation, improve neutrino mass ordering studies, and test for the unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix with high precision. A critical component in these low-energy physics analyses is the accurate reconstruction of event information, particularly the zenith angle of incoming neutrinos. In this study, we discuss the processes that limit the zenith resolution, which include the transverse spread of the hadronic shower, in-ice photon scattering, module resolutions, and module noise. By considering approximations to these processes, we aim to approach the intrinsic zenith resolution limits for purely hadronic events.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>

      <title>Physics Prospects with MeV Neutrino-Argon Charged Current Interactions using Enhanced Photon Detection in Future LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate MeV-scale electron neutrino charged current interactions in a liquid argon time projection chamber equipped with an enhanced photon detection system. Using simulations of deposited energy in charge and light calorimetry, we explore the potential for dual calorimetric neutrino energy reconstruction. We found energy reconstruction based on light-only calorimetry has a better resolution than combined charge and light calorimetry when hadrons are produced in these events. Meanwhile, enhanced light detection offers improved nanosecond timing resolution and broad optical coverage, enabling neutron tagging and identification of delayed low-energy gamma emissions. These advancements open new avenues in low-energy neutrino physics in next-generation LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic systems for the TUCAN EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TUCAN (TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron) Collaboration is completing a new ultracold neutron (UCN) source. The UCN source will deliver UCNs to a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment. The EDM experiment is projected to be capable of an uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm, competitive with other planned projects, and a factor of ten more precise than the present world's best. The TUCAN source is based on a UCN production volume of superfluid helium (He-II), held at 1~K, and coupled to a proton-driven spallation target. The production rate in the source is expected to be in excess of $10^7$~UCN/s; since UCN losses can be small in superfluid helium, this should allow us to build up a large number of UCNs. The spallation-driven superfluid helium technology is the principal aspect making the TUCAN project unique. The superfluid production volume was recently cooled, for the first time, and successfully filled with superfluid helium. The design principles of the UCN source are described, along with some of the challenging cryogenic milestones that were recently passed.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential, which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulation studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using the SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well-designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, monitoring of the tensor polarization of the deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, where the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximately 80\%.</description>

      <title>Two-step focusing anamorphic catadioptric telescope and componentwise aberration compensations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aberration compensation with emphasis on the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. A narrow field-of-view double-plane symmetric telescope objective containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light separately in the two dimensions of the image plane, is introduced. Analytical derivation of the compensation rules is discussed for the telescope being composed of a Cassegrain-type cylindrical reflective subsystem and an economical refractive one that is determined by up to six essential parameters. Performance of a more advanced version of this telescope, which contains a less aberrative nine-parameter refractive subsystem, is studied using the ray-tracing simulator CODE~V. The telescopes of the introduced type provide two independent focal distances for the discussed focusings in the orthogonal dimensions allowing to set up a favorable field of view, and potentially can be used to achieve larger effective aperture area and resolution on a small spacecraft.</description>
