      <title>Catalytic evolution of cooperation in a population with behavioural bimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable adaptability of humans in response to complex environments is often demonstrated by the context-dependent adoption of different behavioral modes. However, the existing game-theoretic studies mostly focus on the single-mode assumption, and the impact of this behavioral multimodality on the evolution of cooperation remains largely unknown. Here, we study how cooperation evolves in a population with two behavioral modes. Specifically, we incorporate Q-learning and Tit-for-Tat (TFT) rules into our toy model, where prisoner's dilemma game is played and we investigate the impact of the mode mixture on the evolution of cooperation. While players in Q-learning mode aim to maximize their accumulated payoffs, players within TFT mode repeat what their neighbors have done to them. In a structured mixing implementation where the updating rule is fixed for each individual, we find that the mode mixture greatly promotes the overall cooperation prevalence. The promotion is even more significant in the probabilistic mixing, where players randomly select one of the two rules at each step. Finally, this promotion is robust when players are allowed to adaptively choose the two modes by real-time comparison. In all three scenarios, players within the Q-learning mode act as catalyzer that turns the TFT players to be more cooperative, and as a result drive the whole population to be highly cooperative. The analysis of Q-tables explains the underlying mechanism of cooperation promotion, which captures the ``psychologic evolution" in the players' mind. Our study indicates that the variety of behavioral modes is non-negligible, and could be crucial to clarify the emergence of cooperation in the real world.</description>

      <title>An approach to non-equilibrium statistical physics using variational Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical social and political prediction algorithm for city planning and public participation using the Impulse Pattern Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlinear-dynamical algorithm for city planning is proposed as an Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) for predicting relevant parameters like health, artistic freedom, or financial developments of different social or political stakeholders over the cause of a planning process. The IPF has already shown high predictive precision at low computational cost in musical instrument simulations, brain dynamics, and human-human interactions. The social and political IPF consists of three basic equations of system state developments, self-adaptation of stakeholders, two adaptive interactions, and external impact terms suitable for respective planning situations. Typical scenarios of stakeholder interactions and developments are modeled by adjusting a set of system parameters. These include stakeholder reaction to external input, enhanced system stability through self-adaptation, stakeholder convergence due to adaptive interaction, as well as complex dynamics in terms of fixed stakeholder impacts. A workflow for implementing the algorithm in real city planning scenarios is outlined. This workflow includes machine learning of a suitable set of parameters suggesting best-practice planning to aim at the desired development of the planning process and its output.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition from a continuous to a discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete (DTCs) and continuous time crystals (CTCs) are novel dynamical many-body states, that are characterized by robust self-sustained oscillations, emerging via spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. DTCs are periodically driven systems that oscillate with a subharmonic of the external drive, while CTCs are continuously driven and oscillate with a frequency intrinsic to the system. Here, we explore a phase transition from a continuous time crystal to a discrete time crystal. A CTC with a characteristic oscillation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ is prepared in a continuously pumped atom-cavity system. Modulating the pump intensity of the CTC with a frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}$ close to $2\,\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ leads to robust locking of $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ to $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/2$, and hence a DTC arises. This phase transition in a quantum many-body system is related to subharmonic injection locking of non-linear mechanical and electronic oscillators or lasers.</description>

      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent-based model of language change in which language is transmitted from a tutor to a pupil which itself becomes a tutor to a new pupil, and so on. Languages that are stable, expressive, and compositional arise spontaneously as a consequence of a language transmission bottleneck. Previous models have implemented an agent's mapping from signals to meanings using an artificial neural network decoder, but have relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to implement the associated encoder, mapping from meanings to signals. Here, a new model is presented in which both decoder and encoder are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning, and trained together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the substantial computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during human development.</description>
