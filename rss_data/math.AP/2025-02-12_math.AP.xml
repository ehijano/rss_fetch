      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Incoherent Branched Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves propagating through weakly disordered smooth linear media undergo a universal phenomenon called branched flow. Branched flows have been observed and studied experimentally in various systems by considering coherent waves. Recent experiments have reported the observation of optical branched flows by using an incoherent light source, thus revealing the key role of coherent phase-sensitive effects in the development of incoherent branched flows. By considering the paraxial wave equation as a generic representative model, we elaborate a stochastic theory of both coherent and incoherent branched flows. We derive closed-form equations that determine the evolution of the intensity correlation function, as well as the value and the propagation distance of the maximum of the scintillation index, which characterize the dynamical formation of incoherent branched flows. We report accurate numerical simulations that are found in quantitative agreement with the theory without free parameters. Our theory elucidates the key role of coherence and interference on branched flows, thereby providing a framework for exploring branched flow in nonlinear media, in relation with the formation of freak waves in oceans.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Weak Solutions for Biot-Stokes Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the issue of uniqueness of weak solutions for linear, inertial fluid-poroelastic-structure coupled dynamics. The model comprises a 3D Biot poroelastic system coupled to a 3D incompressible Stokes flow via a 2D interface, where kinematic, stress-matching, and tangential-slip conditions are prescribed. Our previous work provided a construction of weak solutions, these satisfying an associated finite energy inequality. However, several well-established issues related to the dynamic coupling, hinder a direct approach to obtaining uniqueness and continuous dependence. In particular, low regularity of the hyperbolic (Lam\'e) component of the model precludes the use of the solution as a test function, which would yield the necessary a priori estimate. In considering degenerate and non-degenerate cases separately, we utilize two different approaches. In the former, energy estimates are obtained for arbitrary weak solutions through a systematic decoupling of the constituent dynamics, and well-posedness of weak solutions is inferred. In the latter case, an abstract semigroup approach is utilized to obtain uniqueness via a precise characterization of the adjoint of the dynamics operator. The results here can be adapted to other systems of poroelasticity, as well as to the general theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic-parabolic coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Existence and Convergence of Least-Energy Solutions Involving the Logarithmic Schr\"odinger Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the first existence result for solutions to the critical semilinear equation involving the logarithmic Schr\"odinger operator with subcritical logarithmic nonlinearities. Additionally, we present the first existence result for least-energy solutions to the Brezis-Nirenberg type problem for the fractional pseudo-relativistic Schr\"odinger operator with subcritical and critical nonlinearities. Specifically, we demonstrate that the least-energy solutions of the fractional pseudo-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation converge, up to a subsequence, to a nontrivial least-energy solution of the limiting problem involving the logarithmic Schr\"odinger operator. Furthermore, we provide regularity result for solutions to the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear nonlinearities. Our approach relies on uniform positive bounds for elements in the Nehari manifold, least-energy solutions, the Mountain-pass structure, the Palais-Smale condition, variational methods and asymptotic expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new framework for studying the existence of generalized or strongly generalized solutions to a wide class of inclusion systems involving double-phase, possibly competing differential operators, convection, and mixed boundary conditions is introduced. The technical approach exploits Galerkin's method and a surjective theorem for multifunctions in finite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Critical exponent for the one-dimensional wave equation with a space-dependent scale invariant damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional wave equation with space-dependent damping of the form $\mu_0(1+x^2)^{-1/2}$, where $\mu_0&gt;0$,
  and time derivative nonlinearity.
  We establish global existence of mild solutions for small data compactly supported by employing energy estimates within suitable Sobolev spaces of the associated homogeneous problem.
  Furthermore, we derive a blow-up result under some positive initial data by employing the test function method. This shows that the critical exponent is given by $p_G(1+\mu_0)=1+2/\mu_0$, when $\mu_0\in (0,1]$, where $p_G$ is the Glassey exponent. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first identification of the critical exponent range for this class of equations. As by product, we extend the global existence result to a more general class of space/time nonlinearities of the form $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_x u|^{q}$ or $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_tu|^{p}|\partial_x u|^{q}$, with $p,q&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness for the nonlinear dynamical Lam\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear dynamical Lam\'e system with double wave speeds in a $d$-dimensional $(d=2,3)$ periodic domain. Moreover, the equations can be transformed into a linearly degenerate hyperbolic system. We could construct infinitely many continuous solutions in $C^{1,\alpha}$ emanating from the same small initial data for $\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{60}$. The proof relies on the convex integration scheme. We construct a new class of building blocks with compression structure by using the double wave speeds characteristic of the equations.</description>

      <title>The null condition in elastodynamics leads to non-uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the system of elastodynamic equations in two dimensions. Specifically, we focus on materials characterized by a null condition imposed on the quadratic part of the nonlinearity. We can construct non-zero weak solutions $u \in C^1([0, T] \times \mathbb{T}^2)$ that emanate from zero initial data. The proof relies on the convex integration scheme. By exploiting the characteristic double wave speeds of the equations, we construct a new class of building blocks. This work extends the application of convex integration techniques to hyperbolic systems with a null condition and reveals the rich solution structure in nonlinear elastodynamics.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions for fully fractional parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fully fractional heat equation involving the master operator: $$ (\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = f(x,t)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \R^n\times\R , $$ where $s\in(0,1)$ and $f(x,t) \geq 0$.
  First we derive H\"{o}lder and Schauder estimates for nonnegative solutions of this equation. Due to the {\em nonlocality} of the master operator, existing results (cf. \cite{ST}) rely on global bounds of the solutions $u$ to control their higher local norms. However, such results are inadequate for blow-up and rescaling analysis aimed at obtaining a priori estimates for solutions to {\em nonlocal } equations on unbounded domains, as the global norms of the rescaled functions may diverge.
  This limitation raises to a natural and challenging question:
  {\em Can local bounds of solutions replace global bounds to control their higher local norms?}
  Here, we provide an affirmative answer to this question for nonnegative solutions. To achieve this, we introduced several new ideas and novel techniques. One of the key innovations is to use a {\em directional perturbation average} to derive an important estimate for the fully fractional heat kernel, as stated in Lemma \ref{key0}. We believe this estimate, along with other new techniques introduced here, will serve as powerful tools in regularity estimates for a wide range of nonlocal equations.
  Building on this breakthrough, we employ the blow-up and rescaling arguments to establish a priori estimates for solutions to a broader class of nonlocal equations in unbounded domains, such as $$(\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = b(x,t) |\nabla_x u (x,t)|^q + f(x, u(x,t))\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \R^n\times\R.$$ Under appropriate conditions, we prove that all nonnegative solutions, along with their spatial gradients, are uniformly bounded.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma-$convergence of energy functionals in fractional Orlicz spaces beyond the $\Delta_2$ condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Young function $A$, $n\geq 1$ and $s\in(0,1)$ we consider the energy functional $$ \mathcal{J}_s(u)=(1-s)\iint_{\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n} A\left(\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|}{|x-y|^s}\right)\frac{dxdy}{|x-y|^n}. $$ Without assuming the $\Delta_2$ condition on $A$ not its conjugated function $\bar A$, we prove the following liminf inequality: if $u\in E^A(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\{u_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subset E^A(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is such that $u_k\to u$ in $E^A(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and $s_k\to 1$, then $$ \mathcal{J}(u) \leq \liminf_{k\to\infty } \mathcal{J}_{s_k}(u_k), $$ where $\mathcal{J}$ is a limit functional related with the behavior of the fractional Orlicz-Sobolev spaces as $s\to 1^+$. As a direct consequence, we obtain the $\Gamma-$convergence of the functional $\mathcal{J}_s$.
  Finally, we extend our result to the study of the so called \emph{fractional peridynamic} case.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetry Analysis, Parametric Reduction and Conservation Laws of (3+1) Dimensional Nonlinear Dispersive Soliton Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract:   The core focus of this research work is to obtain invariant solutions and conservation laws of the (3+1) dimensional ZK equation which describes the phenomenon of wave stability and solitons propagation. ZK equation is significant in fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and acoustics. ZK equation plays an important role in understanding the behavior of nonlinear, dispersive waves especially in the presence of the magnetic field. Lie symmetry analysis has been applied to the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation to derive invariant solutions. These solutions disclose how waves retain their shape as they travel, how they interact in space, and the impact of magnetic fields on wave propagation. Using the Lie symmetry, (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation reduces into various ordinary differential equations. It also concludes with the conservation laws and non-linear self adjoint-ness property for the (3+1)-dimensional ZK Equation.</description>

      <title>Control on Hilbert Space and Mean Field Control: the Common Noise Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide an equivalent of the theory developed in P.~Cardaliaguet, F.~Delarue, J.M.~Lasry, P.L.~Lions \cite{CDLL}, following the approach of control on Hilbert spaces introduced by the authors in \cite{BGY-2}. We include the common noise in this paper, so the alternative is now complete. Since we consider a control problem, our theory applies only to Mean field control and not to mean field games. The assumptions are adapted to guarantee a unique optimal control, so they insure that the cost functional is strictly convex and coercive.</description>

      <title>Neural network-motivated regularity analysis of inverse problems and application to inverse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Lipschitz regularity estimates for an approximate inverse of a general compact operator that depends non-linearly on a vector parameter. The regularity estimates are motivated by the desire to develop neural networks (NN) that compute that approximate inverse and the convergence of the NNs follows from the Lipschitz regularity estimates. Such compact operators arise in inverse wave scattering applications with unbounded domains, and we illustrate our theory by showing that the particular assumptions of our regularity analysis hold for the problem of identifying cracks from far field data. Numerical results using a NN for parameter recovery demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to relax convexity assumption on some classical results in mean curvature flow. In the first half of the paper, we prove a generalized version of Hamilton's differential Harnack inequality which holds for mean convex solutions to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1}{H}$ where $\lambda_1$ is the smallest principal curvature. Then, we use classical maximum principle to provide several characterizations of family of shrinking spheres for closed, mean convex ancient solution to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1 + .. + \lambda_k}{H}$ for some $1 \leq k \leq d-1$, where $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq .. \leq \lambda_d$ are the principal curvatures.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on singular capillary cones with free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimizing singular cones with free boundary associated with the capillarity problem. Precisely, we provide a stability criterion $\`a$ la Jerison-Savin for capillary hypersurfaces and show that, in dimensions up to $4$, minimizing cones with non-sign-changing mean curvature are flat. We apply this criterion to minimizing capillary drops and, additionally, establish the instability of non-trivial axially symmetric cones in dimensions up to $6$.
  The main results are based on a Simons-type inequality for a class of convex, homogeneous, symmetric functions of the principal curvatures, combined with a boundary condition specific to the capillary setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs energy $E(\Phi,A)=\int_M|d_A\Phi|^2+|F_A|^2$ in the large mass limit, proving convergence to the codimension-three area functional in the sense of De Giorgi's $\Gamma$-convergence. More precisely, for a compact manifold with boundary $M$ and any family of pairs $\Phi_m\in\Omega^0(M;\mathfrak{su}(2))$ and $A_m\in \Omega^1(M;\mathfrak{su}(2))$ indexed by a mass parameter $m\to\infty$, satisfying $$E(\Phi_m,A_m)\leq Cm\quad\text{and}\quad\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{m}\int_M(m-|\Phi_m|)^2=0,$$ we prove that the $(n-3)$-currents dual to $\frac{1}{2\pi m}\mathrm{tr}(d_{A_m}\Phi_m\wedge F_{A_m})$ converge subsequentially to a relative integral $(n-3)$-cycle $T$ of mass \begin{equation}
  \mathbb{M}(T)\leq \liminf_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi m}E(\Phi_m,A_m), \end{equation} and show conversely that any integral $(n-3)$-current $T$ with $[T]=0\in H_{n-3}(M,\partial M;\mathbb{Z})$ admits such an approximation, with equality in the above inequality. In the special case of pairs $(\Phi_m,A_m)$ satisfying the generalized monopole equation $*d_{A_m}\Phi_m=F_{A_m}\wedge \Theta$ for a calibration form $\Theta\in \Omega^{n-3}(M)$, we deduce that the limit $\nu=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi m}|d_{A_m}\Phi_m|^2$ of the Dirichlet energy measures satisfies $\nu\leq |T|$, with equality if and only if $T$ is calibrated by $\Theta$, giving evidence for predictions of Donaldson-Segal in the settings of $G_2$-manifolds and Calabi-Yau $3$-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.00348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an elliptic problem with the Dirichlet boundary condition. We operate in Sobolev spaces and the main analytic tool we use is the Lax-Milgram lemma. First, we present the variational approach of the problem which allows us to apply different functional analysis techniques. Then we study thoroughly the well-posedness of the problem. We conclude our work with a solution of the problem using numerical analysis techniques and the free software freefem++.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the spectral gap and an extension of the Bonnet-Myers theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a fairly general class of Riemannian manifolds M, we prove lower estimates in terms of the Ricci curvature for the spectral bound (when M has infinite volume) and for the spectral gap (when M has finite volume) for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As a byproduct of our results we obtain an extension of the Bonnet-Myers theorem on the compactness of the manifold. We also prove lower bounds for the spectral gap for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators on weighted manifolds. As an application we prove lower bounds for the spectral gap of perturbations of some radial measures on R n .</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the viscous surface wave in an infinitely deep ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an incompressible viscous fluid in an infinitely deep ocean, being bounded above by a free moving boundary. The governing equations are the gravity-driven incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable density and no surface tension is taken into account on the free surface. After using the Lagrangian transformation, we write the main equations in a perturbed form in a fixed domain. In the first part, we describe a spectral analysis of the linearized equations around a hydrostatic equilibrium $(\rho_0(x_3), 0, P_0(x_3))$ for a smooth increasing density profile $\rho_0$. Precisely, we prove that there exist infinitely many normal modes to the linearized equations by following the operator method initiated by Lafitte and Nguyen. In the second part, we study the nonlinear Rayleigh-Taylor instability around the above profile by constructing a \textit{wide class} of initial data for the nonlinear perturbation problem departing from the equilibrium, based on the finding of infinitely many normal modes. Our nonlinear result follows the previous framework of Guo and Strauss and also of Grenier with a refinement.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct the fractional powers of the sub-Laplacian in Carnot groups through an analytic continuation approach. In addition, we characterize the powers of the fractional sub-Laplacian in the Heisenberg group, and as a byproduct we compute the $k$-th order momenta with respect to the heat kernel.</description>

      <title>A duality method for mean-field limits with singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to derive mean-field limits for first- and second-order particle systems with singular interactions. It is based on a duality approach combined with the analysis of linearized dual correlations, and it allows to cover for the first time arbitrary square-integrable interaction forces at possibly vanishing temperature. In case of first-order systems, it allows to recover in particular the mean-field limit to the 2d Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The approach also provides convergence rates.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonlinear dispersive equations of Schr\"odinger-type involving fractional powers $0&lt;s\le 1$ of the Laplacian and a defocusing power-law nonlinearity. We conduct numerical simulations in the case of small, energy supercritical $s$ and provide evidence for a novel type of highly oscillatory singularity within the solution.</description>

      <title>Around the Quantum Lenard-Balescu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the mean-field regime, a gas of quantum particles with Boltzmann statistics can be described by the Hartree-Fock equation. This dynamics becomes trivial if the initial distribution of particle is invariant by translation. However, the first correction is given on time of order $O(N)$ by the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation. In the first part of the present article, we justify this equation until time of order $O((\log N)^{1-\delta})$ (for any $\delta\in(0,1)$).
  A similar phenomenon exists in the classical setting (with a similar validity time obtained by Duerinckx \cite{Duerinckx}). In a second time, we prove the convergence for dimension $d\geq 2$ of the solutions of the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation to the solutions of its classical counterpart in the semi-classical limit. This problem can be interpreted as a grazing collision limit: the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation looks like a cut-off Boltzmann equation, when the classical one looks like the Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of boundary layers in the entire subsonic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the physical importance, there are limited mathematical theories for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with strong boundary layers. This is mainly due to the absence of a stream function structure, unlike the extensively studied incompressible fluid dynamics in two dimensions. This paper aims to establish the structural stability of boundary layer profiles in the form of shear flow for the two-dimensional steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Our estimates are uniform across the entire subsonic regime, where the Mach number $m\in (0,1)$. As a byproduct, we provide the first result concerning the low Mach number limit in the presence of Prandtl boundary layers. The proof relies on the quasi-compressible-Stokes iteration introduced in [38], along with a subtle analysis of the interplay between density and velocity variables in different frequency regimes, and the identification of cancellations in higher-order estimates.</description>

      <title>Estimating and using information in inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, one attempts to infer spatially variable functions from indirect measurements of a system. To practitioners of inverse problems, the concept of "information" is familiar when discussing key questions such as which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and detectors, because we have "the most information" for these places. Although referenced in many publications, the "information" that is invoked in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity.
  Herein, we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem. We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>
