      <title>Differential cross-section measurements of $D^{\pm}$ and $D_{s}^{\pm}$ meson production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of $D^{\pm}$ and $D_{s}^{\pm}$ charmed mesons is measured using the $D^{\pm}/D_{s}^{\pm} \to \phi(\mu\mu)\pi^{\pm}$ decay channel with 137 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during the years 2016-2018. The charmed mesons are reconstructed in the range of transverse momentum $12 &lt; p_\mathrm{T} &lt; 100$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta| &lt; 2.5$. The differential cross-sections are measured as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and compared with next-to-leading-order QCD predictions. The predictions are found to be consistent with the measurements in the visible kinematic region within the large theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Energy scale and resolution for anti-$k_t$ jets with radius parameters $R=0.2$ and 0.6 measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets with different radius parameters $R$ are an important tool to probe quantum chromodynamics processes at different angular scales. Jets with small $R=0.2$ are instrumental in measurements of the substructure of large-$R$ jets resulting from collimated hadronic decays of energetic $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons, top quarks, and of potential new resonances. Measurements are presented of the energy scale and resolution of jets with radius parameters $R=0.2$ and 0.6 obtained with the ATLAS detector using $37 \text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, with their associated uncertainties. A new in situ method to measure jet energy scale differences between data and Monte Carlo simulations is presented. The systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale for central jets ($|\eta| &lt; 1.2$) typically vary from 1% to about 5% as a function of $|\eta|$ at very low transverse momentum, $p_{\text{T}}$, of around 20 GeV for both $R=0.2$ and 0.6 jets. The relative energy resolution ranges from $(35 \pm 6)$% at $p_{\text{T}} = 20$ GeV to $(6 \pm 0.5)$% at $p_{\text{T}} = 300$ GeV for central $R=0.2$ jets, and is found to be slightly worse for $R=0.6$ jets. Finally, the effect of close-by hadronic activity on the jet energy scale is investigated and is found to be well modelled by the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>First Constraint on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background through the CE$\nu$NS process from the LZ experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the limits on the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) flux and the fundamental DSNB parameters measured from the first science run of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment, a dual-phase xenon detector located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, USA. This is the first time the DSNB limit is measured through the process of the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). Using an exposure of 60~live days and a fiducial mass of 5.5~t, the upper limit on the DSNB $\nu_x$ (each of $\nu_\mu$, $\nu_\tau$, $\bar\nu_\mu$, $\bar\nu_\tau$) flux is $686-826$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at the 90\% confidence level for neutrino energies E$&gt;$19.3~MeV, assuming the flux for each $\nu_x$ flavor is the same. The interval accounts for the uncertainty in existing DSNB models. The present result is comparable to the existing best limit and further improvements are expected after collecting data from an estimated 1,000-day exposure in the future.</description>

      <title>The HIBEAM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of baryon number is an essential ingredient for baryogenesis - the preferential creation of matter over antimatter - needed to account for the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe. However, such a process has yet to be experimentally observed. The HIBEAM/NNBAR program is a proposed two-stage experiment at the European Spallation Source to search for baryon number violation. The program will include high-sensitivity searches for processes that violate baryon number by one or two units: free neutron-antineutron oscillation via mixing, neutron-antineutron oscillation via regeneration from a sterile neutron state and neutron disappearance; the effective process of neutron regeneration is also possible. The program can be used to discover and characterize mixing in the neutron, antineutron and sterile neutron sectors. The experiment addresses topical open questions such as the origins of baryogenesis and the nature of dark matter, and is sensitive to scales of new physics substantially in excess of those available at colliders. A goal of the program is to open a discovery window to neutron conversion probabilities (sensitivities) by up to three orders of magnitude compared with previous searches, which is a rare opportunity. A conceptual design report for NNBAR has recently been published.</description>

      <title>Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak supervision combines the advantages of training on real data with the ability to exploit signal properties. However, training a neural network using weak supervision often requires an excessive amount of signal data, which severely limits its practical applicability. In this study, we propose addressing this limitation through data augmentation, increasing the training data's size and diversity. Specifically, we focus on physics-inspired data augmentation methods, such as $p_{\text{T}}$ smearing and jet rotation. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of weak supervision, enabling neural networks to learn efficiently from substantially less data.</description>

      <title>A tale of $Z$+jet: SMEFT effects and the Lam-Tung relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on dimension-six light-quark dipole operators within the Standard Model (SM) effective field theory, based on measurements of $Z$ production at SLC and LEP, as well as $Z$+jet production at the LHC. Our new constraints exclude the parameter space that could potentially explain the observed discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the Lam-Tung relation. With these updated limits, we model-independently determine the maximum possible influence that beyond-SM contributions could have on the angular coefficients $A_0$ and $A_2$, which enter the Lam-Tung relation.</description>

      <title>Global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering with dispersive constraints: beyond the S0 wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering for the S2, P, D, F, and G partial waves up to at least 1.8 GeV, easy to implement for phenomenological use. With earlier S0-wave parameterizations, slightly updated here, they reproduce previous partial wave dispersion analyses up to the $\pi\omega$ threshold. In addition, these new parameterizations have improved their description of recent P-wave data, the inelasticity in various waves, and their fulfillment of Roy-like and forward dispersion relations. The latter now test very high partial waves and have an improved matching with the Regge regime, extending those with P-wave contributions up to 1.6 GeV. Above 1.6 GeV and up to 1.8 GeV, or sometimes somewhat beyond, the parameterizations are simple unconstrained fits to data.</description>

      <title>On the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OKA Collaboration has obtained a new upper limit on the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay probability which is 65 times lower than the one currently listed by PDG. However it is still about $10^{4}$ times worse than the theoretical prediction. It was suggested that production of pionium $A_{2\pi}$ in the final state of the semileptonic $K^+$ decay with subsequent $A_{2\pi} \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ decay will increase the value of theoretical branching ratio due to the absence of five-particle phase space suppression. The estimates done in our paper show that despite the gain in the phase space the decay $K^+ \to A_{2\pi}\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ appeares to be strongly suppressed because of the smallness of the pionium wave function at zero $\pi$ mesons separation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of light-by-light scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process, and search for axion-like particles in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of light-by-light scattering (LbL, $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) and the Breit--Wheeler process (BW, $\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) are reported in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$, was collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2018. Events with an exclusively produced $\gamma\gamma$ or $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ pair with invariant masses $m^{\gamma\gamma,\mathrm{ee}}$ $&gt;$ 5 GeV, along with other fiducial criteria, are selected. The measured BW fiducial production cross section, $\sigma_\text{fid}$($\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) = 263.5 $\pm$ 1.8 (stat) $\pm$ 17.8 (syst) $\mu$b, as well as the differential distributions for various kinematic observables, are in agreement with leading-order quantum electrodynamics predictions complemented with final-state photon radiation. The measured differential BW cross sections allow discriminating between different theoretical descriptions of the photon flux of the lead ion. In the LbL final state, 26 exclusive diphoton candidate events are observed compared with 12.0 $\pm$ 2.9 expected for the background. Combined with previous results, the observed significance of the LbL signal with respect to the background-only hypothesis is above five standard deviations. The measured fiducial LbL scattering cross section, $\sigma_\text{fid} (\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma)$ = 107 $\pm$ 24 (stat) $\pm$ 13 (syst) nb, is in agreement with next-to-leading-order predictions. Limits on the production of axion-like particles coupled to photons are set over the mass range 5-100 GeV, including the most stringent limits to date in the range of 5-10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Neural network biased corrections: Cautionary study in background corrections for quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal anisotropies of charged particles with high transverse momentum in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A measurement is presented of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) azimuthal anisotropy coefficients for charged particles produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $0.44$ nb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2018. The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for charged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$), 1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and multi-particle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event fluctuations and non-flow effects in the measurements of azimuthal anisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\text{T}}$ of approximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals. Positive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both methods, though the application of three-subevent technique to the multi-particle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest $p_{\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\text{T}}$ ($p_{\text{T}} \gtrapprox 10$ GeV), charged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation. These jets, and hence the measurements presented here, are sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>High-Dynamic Range Broadband Terahertz Time-Domain Spectrometer Based on Organic Crystal MNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high power and broadband THz-TDS setup utilizing the nonlinear organic crystal MNA both as emitter and detector. The THz source is based on optical rectification of near infra-red laser pulses at a central wavelength of 1036 nm from a commercial, high-power Yb-based laser system and reaches a high THz average power of 11 mW at a repetition rate of 100 kHz and a broad and smooth bandwidth of more than 9 THz. The conversion efficiency is high (0.13%) in spite of the high excitation average power of 8 W. We validate the high dynamic range and reliability of the source for applications in linear spectroscopy by measuring the broadband THz properties of chi(2) nonlinear crystals up to 8 THz. This new high-repetition rate source is very promising for ultra-broadband THz spectroscopy at high dynamic range and/or reduced measurement times.</description>

      <title>PALM -- Precision Attenuation Length Measurement in Liquid Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future neutrino experiments at low energies such as JUNO or THEIA will use large volume homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors. The optical attenuation length of the liquid is of uttermost importance for the successful realization of these experiments. At TU Munich a new optical spectrometer (Precision Attenuation Length Measurement (PALM)) has been set up in order to measure the light attenuation of liquids which can be used for these types of experiments up to around 100 m in the wavelength region between 400 nm and 1000 nm. The setup features an optical imaging system with a long focal length, which allows for in-situ monitoring of the beam stability during the measurement. The setup capability as well as the reproducibility of its results has been demonstrated at two different wavelengths of 430 nm and 500 nm.</description>

      <title>Study of the Radiation Hardness of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter Optical Instrumentation with Run 2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the radiation hardness of the hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment in the LHC Run 2. Both the plastic scintillators constituting the detector active media and the wavelength-shifting optical fibres collecting the scintillation light into the photodetector readout are elements susceptible to radiation damage. The dedicated calibration and monitoring systems of the detector (caesium radioactive sources, laser and minimum bias integrator) allow to assess the response of these optical components. Data collected with these systems between 2015 and 2018 are analysed to measure the degradation of the optical instrumentation across Run 2. Moreover, a simulation of the total ionising dose in the calorimeter is employed to study and model the degradation profile as a function of the exposure conditions, both integrated dose and dose rate. The measurement of the relative light output loss in Run 2 is presented and extrapolations to future scenarios are drawn based on current data. The impact of radiation damage on the cell response uniformity is also analysed.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 operators in $W^+W^-$ production via gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dimension-8 operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC for the incoming gluon-gluon channel. To this end, we have identified all dimension-8 CP-even operators contributing to the process in question, and computed the corresponding tree-level helicity amplitudes for fully-leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons. These are implemented in the program MCFM-RE, which automatically incorporates the effect of a jet-veto to reduce the otherwise overwhelming $t\bar t$ background. We find that, unless we break the hierarchy of the effective field theory (EFT), the interference of the dimension-8 operators with the Standard Model is negligible across the considered distributions. This justifies including the square of dimension-6 operators when performing EFT fits with this channel. We then present new constraints on CP-even and CP-odd dimension-6 operators within the EFT regime. Lastly, we postulate a scenario in which the hierarchy of the EFT is broken, justified by the strong constraints on dimension-6 operators from existing on-shell Higgs data. In this scenario, we discuss the constraints that can be reasonably set on CP-even dimension-8 operators with current and future data. We remark that the effect of the jet-veto on the ability to constrain new physics in the $W^+W^-$ channel is quite dramatic and must be properly taken into account.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy asymmetric scalar tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar tetraquarks $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ with asymmetric contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$ are explored using the QCD sum rule method. These states are modeled as the diquark-antidiquarks composed of the axial-vector components. The masses and current couplings of $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The predictions obtained for the masses of these four-quark mesons prove that they are unstable against the strong two-meson fall-apart decays to conventional mesons. In the case of the tetraquark $ T_{b}$ this is the decay $T_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The processes $T_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are kinematically allowed decay modes of the tetraquark $ T_{c}$. The widths of corresponding processes are evaluated by employing the QCD three-point sum rule approach which are necessary to estimate strong couplings at the tetraquark-meson-meson vertices of interest. The mass $ m=(15697 \pm 95)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_b]=(36.0 \pm 10.2)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b}$ as well as the parameters $ \widetilde{m}=(9680 \pm 102)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[T_c]=(54.7 \pm 9.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $T_{c}$ provide useful information to search for and interpret new exotic states.</description>

      <title>High precision X-ray spectroscopy of kaonic neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-precision kaonic neon X-ray transitions measurement performed by the SIDDHARTA-2 collaboration at the DA$\Phi$NE collider is reported. Both the X-ray energies and yields for high-n transitions were measured, demonstrating the feasibility of sub-eV Xray spectroscopy for kaonic atoms using low-Z gaseous targets. The measurement provides valuable insights into the de-excitation processes in kaonic atoms, providing new input data for the refinement of the corresponding theoretical models, and a framework for testing Quantum Electrodynamics in strange exotic atoms.</description>

      <title>Flavor Violations in $B$-Mesons within Non-Minimal SU(5)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent anomalies in $B$-meson decays, such as deviations in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$, suggest possible lepton flavor universality violation and new exotic interactions. In this work, we explore these anomalies within a non-minimal SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) framework, which introduces a 45-dimensional Higgs representation predicting exotic scalar particles, including the leptoquark $R_2$ and diquark $S_6$. The $R_2$ leptoquark addresses charged current anomalies in $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions, the $S_6$ diquark contributes to nonleptonic neutral current processes, such as $B\to K\pi$ while at the loop level, the exchange of a leptoquark and diquark contributes to $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$ offering solutions to longstanding puzzles.</description>

      <title>A Review of NEST Models for Liquid Xenon and Exhaustive Comparison to Other Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper will discuss the microphysical simulation of interactions in liquid xenon, the active detector medium in many leading rare-event searches for new physics, and describe experimental observables useful for understanding detector performance. The scintillation and ionization yield distributions for signal and background will be presented using the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST), which is a toolkit based on experimental data and simple, empirical formulae, which mimic previous microphysics modeling, but are guided by data. The NEST models for light and charge production as a function of the particle type, energy, and electric field will be reviewed, as well as models for energy resolution and final pulse areas. NEST will be compared to other models or sets of models, and vetted against real data, with several specific examples pulled from XENON, ZEPLIN, LUX, LZ, PandaX, and table-top experiments used for calibrations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of strange baryon production in charged-particle jets in pp and p-Pb collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enhancement of the ratio of strange to non-strange hadrons with increasing charged-particle multiplicity density is often interpreted as a signature of the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. However, this effect has also been observed in smaller systems, such as pp and p-Pb collisions. Understanding this effect requires a detailed description of the production mechanisms of strange hadrons in and out of jets. In this manuscript are presented published results on the production of $\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}$, $\Lambda (\bar\Lambda)$, $\Xi^\pm$ and $\Omega^\pm$ hadrons in charged-particle jets and the underlying event in pp and p-Pb collisions measured by ALICE. In addition, a new analysis of in-jet fragmentation into $\Lambda$ and $\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}$ hadrons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV using LHC Run 3 data is shown.</description>

      <title>Correlating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays and flavor observables in leptoquark models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate minimal scalar leptoquark models that dynamically generate neutrino Majorana masses at the one-loop level and examine their implications for low-energy processes. We show that these models can produce viable neutrino masses, consistent with neutrino oscillation and cosmological data. By using leptoquark couplings fixed by neutrino data, we predict additional contributions to neutrinoless double-beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$), which are chirality enhanced and compete with the standard contributions from the Majorana masses. Our analysis demonstrates that these effects are sizable for leptoquark masses as large as $\mathcal{O}(300~\mathrm{TeV})$, potentially increasing or decreasing the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life, and creating an ambiguity between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ and flavor observables, such as kaon decays and $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, emphasizing that the latter is complementary to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering at $\sqrt{s} = 6$ GeV up to $ \sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV (proton-proton; proton-antiproton; proton-neutron)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, a simultaneous analysis is carried out of 90 sets of data. These sets include the data were obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and high energies at FNAL, ISR, $SP\bar{P}S$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the data of $A_N$. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is found. The importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the CNI region and at large $t$ are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron and the additional term with a large slope have energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term with $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that the additional terms with large slope are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term and oscillation term are proportional to matter distributions. Also, a good description of proton-neutron differential scattering with 526 experimental points is obtained on the basis of the amplitudes taken from the analysis of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering. A good description of the $A_N$ data was also obtained.</description>

      <title>Production and study of antideuterium with the GBAR beamline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of circulating antideuterons ($\mathrm{\overline{d}}$) in the AD/ELENA facility at CERN is under active investigation. Approximately 100 $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ per bunch could be delivered as a $100\,\mathrm{keV}$ beam based on measured cross-sections. These $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ could be further decelerated to $12\,\mathrm{keV}$ using the GBAR scheme, enabling the synthesis of antideuterium ($\mathrm{\overline{D}}$) via charge exchange with positronium, a technique successfully demonstrated with $6\,\mathrm{keV}$ antiprotons for antihydrogen production. The AD/ELENA facility is currently studying the possibility of increasing the $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ rate using an optimized new target geometry. Assuming this is feasible, we propose further enhancing the anti-atom production by using laser-excited positronium in the $2P$ state within a cavity, which is expected to increase the $\mathrm{\overline{D}}(2S)$ production cross-section by almost an order of magnitude for $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ with $2\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy. We present the projected precision for measuring the antideuterium Lamb shift and extracting the antideuteron charge radius, as a function of the beam flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will replace the current CMS Endcap Calorimeter during Long-Shutdown 3. The Endcap Concentrator (ECON) ASICs represent key elements in the readout chain, processing trigger (ECON-T) and data (ECON-D) streams from the HGCROC to the lpGBT. The ECONs will operate in a radiation environment with a High-Energy Hadron (${E\geq20MeV}$) flux up to $2\cdot10^{7} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. This contribution describes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)-based functional verification of the ECON ASICs focusing on the re-use of existing components to manage the complexity of the verification environment.</description>
