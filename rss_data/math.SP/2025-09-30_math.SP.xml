      <title>Optimisation of Steklov transmission eigenvalues and minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the variational properties of Steklov transmission eigenvalues, which can be seen as eigenvalues of the sum of two Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators on two different sides of a given curve contained in a surface. Inspired by the analogous results for Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalues, we show that critical metrics for this problem correspond to the so-called stationary configurations in the Euclidean ball, i.e. pieces of minimal surfaces inside the ball whose normals at the boundary sum up to a vector normal to the boundary sphere. They exhibit strong similarities with free boundary minimal surfaces, and for that reason we call them free curve minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we study the maximisation problem for these eigenvalues in two contexts. First, in the unconstrained setting, we show that there are no smooth maximal metrics. Second, for the first nontrivial eigenvalue, we explicitly characterize rotationally symmetric maximal metrics on the sphere as those arising from the configurations of stacked catenoids with flat caps.</description>

      <title>Dimension-dependent bounds for the SDIEP via phase optimisation and Paley-type constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the cycle-walk (Fourier) template of Gnacik and the author to quantify when a~$\delta$-Sule\u{\i}manova spectrum $(1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n)$ (with $\lambda_j\le 0$) is realised by a symmetric doubly stochastic matrix. For the canonical cycle basis we compute the \emph{exact} size-dependent threshold \[ \delta_n \;=\; 1-\frac{1}{2\cos^2\!\Big(\frac{\pi}{4n}\rho(n)\Big)}, \quad \rho(n)\in\{0,1,2,4\}\ \text{determined by } n\bmod 8, \] which improves $1/2$ if and only if $8\nmid n$; we also prove sharpness for that template. We then introduce an \emph{optimally phase-aligned} cycle basis which removes the `$8\mid n$' artefact and yields better sufficient bound \[ \delta_n^{\rm (ph)} \;=\; \begin{cases} \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/n)}, &amp; n\equiv 0\pmod{4},\\[2mm] \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/2n)}, &amp; n\equiv 2\pmod{4},\\[2mm] \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/4n)}, &amp; n\ \text{odd}, \end{cases} \] so that $\delta_n^{\rm (ph)}&lt;\tfrac12$ for \emph{every} $n\ge3$ and $\delta_n^{\rm (ph)}=\delta_n$ unless $8\mid n$. Next, on abelian $2$-groups, the Walsh--Hadamard basis has coherence $M=1$ and hence suffices for \emph{all} Sule\u{\i}manova lists ($\delta=0$); the same conclusion holds in every Hadamard order (\emph{e.g.}, Paley families).</description>

      <title>Ergodic Hankel operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of operators: ergodic families of self-adjoint Hankel operators realised as integral operators on the half-line. Inspired by the spectral theory of differential and finite-difference operators with ergodic coefficients, we develop a spectral theory of ergodic Hankel operators. For these operators, we define the Integrated Density of States (IDS) measure and establish its fundamental properties. In particular, we determine the total mass of the IDS measure in the positive semi-definite case. We also consider in more detail two classes of ergodic Hankel operators for which we are able to make further progress: periodic Hankel operators and the random Kronig--Penney--Hankel (rKPH) model. For periodic Hankel operators, we prove that the IDS measure is a sum of a pure point and absolutely continuous components, and describe the structure of both components. For the rKPH model, we prove the counterparts of the cornerstone results of the spectral theory of random Schr\"odinger operators: Lifshitz tails at the edges of the spectrum, the Wegner bound and Anderson localisation in a natural asymptotic regime. We conclude with some open problems.</description>

      <title>Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for Schrodinger operator: the Method of Microlocal Wronskian and Gram Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new formulation of the well known Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS) of order 2 for a Schrodinger operator within the algebraic and microlocal framework of B. Helffer and J. Sjostrand; BS holds precisely when the Gram matrix consisting of scalar products of some WKB solutions with respect to the "flux norm" is not invertible. This condition is obtained using the microlocal Wronskian and does not rely on traditional matching techniques. It is simplified by using action-angle variables. The interest of this procedure lies in its possible generalization to more general frameworks, including self-adjoint 1-D h-PDO or matrixvalued Hamiltonians, like Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Convergence of graph Dirichlet energies and graph Laplacians on intersecting manifolds of varying dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\Gamma$-convergence of graph Dirichlet energies and spectral convergence of graph Laplacians on unions of intersecting manifolds of potentially different dimensions. Our investigation is motivated by problems of machine learning, as real-world data often consist of parts or classes with different intrinsic dimensions. An important challenge is to understand which machine learning methods adapt to such varied dimensionalities. We investigate the standard unnormalized and the normalized graph Dirichlet energies. We show that the unnormalized energy and its associated graph Laplacian asymptotically only sees the variations within the manifold of the highest dimension. On the other hand, we prove that the normalized Dirichlet energy converges to a (tensorized) Dirichlet energy on the union of manifolds that adapts to all dimensions simultaneously. We also establish the related spectral convergence and present a few numerical experiments to illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Spectra of generators of Markovian evolution in the thermodynamic limit: From non-Hermitian to full evolution via tridiagonal Laurent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that generators of single-particle, translation-invariant Lindblad operators on the infinite line are unitarily equivalent to direct integrals of finite-range bi-infinite Laurent operator with finite-range perturbations. This representation enables rigorous calculation of spectra for local dissipation such as dephasing and incoherent hopping, and yields proofs of gaplessness, absence of residual spectrum and a condition for convergence of finite volume spectra to their infinite volume counterparts. The analysis relies on new results on the spectra of direct integrals of non-normal operators which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Convexity on Manifolds without Focal points and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study strict convexity on simply connected Riemannian manifolds without focal points, a class of manifolds which contains not only Hadamard manifolds but also examples of manifolds whose sectional curvatures change sign. Using the geometrically defined convex functions on such manifolds, namely the distance function and the Busemann function, strictly convex functions with various desired additional properties are constructed. From the former, we derive interesting consequences such as the continuity of the isoperimetric profile function without conditions on the sectional curvature and, if the manifolds are also K\"ahler, Steinness as well as a lower bound on the volume growth of metric balls. Our primary applications concern the spectrum of the Laplacian. We prove that the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum contains a certain infinite interval assuming only the existence of a point with respect to which the radial curvatures are nonpositive. This is a substantial generalisation of the corresponding result for Hadamard manifolds. In the latter case of Busemann functions, we use the geometry at infinity to give a new construction of a strictly convex function assuming that the Ricci curvature is negative. We then apply this to show that the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous on a class of manifolds for which all the horospheres have the same constant mean curvature. In particular, for a well-studied subclass for which the condition on Ricci curvature is automatically satisfied, we completely determine the spectrum. This construction also enables us to recover the classical result on the spectrum in the case of symmetric spaces of noncompact type and higher rank even though the mean curvatures of horospheres there are not constant.</description>
