      <title>Comment on "Spin-trap isomers in deformed, odd-odd nuclei in the light rare-earth region near N = 98"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry studies of odd-odd light rare-earth nuclei by Orford et al. [Phys. Rev. C 102, 011303(R) (2020)] suggested the existence of new isomers in the neutron rich isotopes $^{162}$Tb and $^{164}$Tb. More recently, Stryjczyk et al. [Phys. Rev. C 111, 049801 (2025)] commented on the former, citing inconsistencies between the available experimental data and the proposed presence of an isomer in $^{162}$Tb. To further examine the possibility of isomeric states in $^{162,164}$Tb, we employed the well-tested empirical Two Quasiparticle Rotor Model to construct their low-lying level structure. The resulting level schemes support the potential existence of low-lying isomeric states in both isotopes and we propose their corresponding spin-parities, orbital configurations, and excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Comments on Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in rather general terms the properties of space-like baryon transition form factors. In particular, we argue why these are necessarily complex-valued, what can be deduced from the respective phase motion and why dealing with real valued transition form factors in general leads to misleading results. For illustration the transition form factors for the Roper resonance as derived in the J\"ulich-Bonn-Washington framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shell and cluster structures in $^{20}$Ne in the variation of multiple bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structures of $^{20}$Ne in the variation of the multiple bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). In this method, the multiple AMD bases are superposed and optimized simultaneously in the total-energy variation. This scheme is beneficial for describing the various configurations in $^{20}$Ne. In the results, we confirm the shell and cluster structures in the $K^\pi=0^+_{1-4}$ bands, such as the deformed states in the $K^\pi=0^+_{1,4}$ bands with the $\alpha$ cluster development, and the spherical shell-like states in the $K^\pi=0^+_2$ band, the latter of which is difficult to describe in the previous AMD calculations imposing the quadrupole deformation. We evaluate the monopole and quadrupole transitions in these states. The negative parity states of $^{20}$Ne with $K^\pi=0^-$ and $2^-$ are discussed in relation to the shell and cluster structures. As a result, six kinds of the $K^\pi$ bands in $^{20}$Ne are described comprehensively in the microscopic framework of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Probing the two-quasiparticle $K^\pi=8^+$ isomeric structure and enhanced stability in the proton drip-line nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by recent experimental discoveries [{Phys. Lett. B \textbf{847}, 138310 (2023)} and {Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 072502 (2024)}], two-quasiparticle $K^\pi=8^+$ isomeric structure (related to the neutron $h_{9/2}$ and $f_{7/2}$ orbitals) in $^{160}_{76}$Os$_{84}$ that lies at the two-proton drip line has been studied by means of the configuration-constrained potential-energy-surface calculations. Calculated results indicate that, for such an isomer, the excitation energy can be well reproduced and its oblate shape can be enhanced by the polarization effects of the two high-$K$ orbits. Comparing with experimental data, two sets of the widely used Woods-Saxon parameters, especially, the spin-orbit coupling one, are evaluated and argued. It is found that, considering the uncertainty of the spin-orbit coupling strength, the energy crossing or inversion of the $h_{9/2}$ and $f_{7/2}$ neutrons can occur, which may lead to three kinds of different evolution-trends of two-quasiparticle excitation energies with the changing quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$. With decreasing spin-orbit coupling interaction, the structure of the $K^\pi=8^+$ isomeric state will evolute from $\nu h_{9/2}f_{7/2}$ ($\nu 9/2^-[505] \otimes 7/2^-[503]$) to the mixing of $\nu h_{9/2}f_{7/2}$ and $\nu h_{9/2}^2$ ($\nu 9/2^-[505] \otimes 7/2^-[514]$) to $\nu h_{9/2}^2$, indicating that its structural probes is still of interest and an arbitrary assignment may be risky. The related theoretical calculations and experimental evidences e.g., the transition properties, are desirable. In addition, similar to that in superheavy nuclei, it is suggested that the stability inversion between high-$K$ isomeric states and ground states might occur in this proton drip-line mass region, e.g., in the hitherto unknown nucleus $^{162}_{78}$Pt$_{84}$.</description>

      <title>Ab initio charge form factors and radii of light isoscalar nuclei: Role of the two-body charge density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make \textit{ab initio} predictions of charge form factors (FFs) and radii for the isoscalar nuclei $^6$Li and $^8$Be using the Jacobi-coordinate No-Core Shell Model. The calculations employ chiral semilocal momentum-space regularized two- and three-nucleon interactions, together with consistently regularized one- and two-nucleon electromagnetic charge operators. With the short-range charge density fixed to the $^4$He charge radius, the predicted FFs and the $^6$Li radius show good agreement with available experimental data. We find that two-nucleon charge density contributions are essential for describing the FFs, particularly at intermediate and large momentum transfers. Although their influence on the charge radii is limited, these contributions remain crucial for attaining accurate predictions. The present results highlight the importance of two-nucleon charge operators in addressing the long-standing underestimation of nuclear charge radii in \textit{ab initio} calculations based on modern chiral interactions.</description>

      <title>Heavy hadron spectrum from 2+1+1 flavor MILC lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07360v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and various mass differences of heavy hadrons containing one or more bottom quarks using MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. For the valence quarks, we employ a combination of lattice actions: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and the $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter (up/down) quarks. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks corresponding to various quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Long Range Outlook for Short-Range Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short range correlated (SRC) N N pairs are pairs of nucleons with high relative momentum (prel &gt; kF where kF ~ 250 MeV/c is the Fermi momentum in medium to heavy nuclei) and lower center of mass momentum. The motivation for studying SRC pairs ranges from a desire to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the many-body nuclear wave-function at high-resolution to searching for explicit QCD-dynamics effects within the nuclear medium, not to mention connections to many other open problems in nuclear physics.
  Exploring short-range correlations was one of the physics motivations for building CEBAF (now Jefferson Lab). Scientists used the high luminosity and high energy of this cutting-edge machine to find kinematics that cleanly showed the signals of short-range correlations. This paved the way in the last two decades for tremendous progress understanding these correlations. This paper reviews recent progress and highlights outstanding questions and areas that need further study.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuation energies over a spatially inhomogeneous field background in a chiral soliton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on chiral soliton models, the quantum fluctuation energies of quarks over a spatially inhomogeneous meson field background have been thoroughly studied. We have used a systematic calculation scheme initiated by Schwinger, in which the loop quantum fluctuation energies are evaluated by a nontrivial level summation over the eigenvalue spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian of the system. The effective Hamiltonian can be constructed by one loop effective action of fluctuations of quarks over a static chiral soliton field background. The corresponding Dirac equation is obtained. In a static and spatially spherical case and by the hedgehog ansatz the radial part and the angular part of the grand spin of the wave function for the Dirac equation can be separated. Due to the soliton background the eigenvalue spectrum are distorted. The scattering phase shift can be determined by solve the radial equations at different momentum. The density of states in momentum space can be derived. The effective Hamiltonian has been diagonalized in a Hilbert space where the eigenfunctions are labeled by the parity, grand spin and energy. The renormalization scheme can be carried out by a Born subtraction of the phase shift and the compensating Feynman diagram renormalization. Finally the finite quantum fluctuation energies over chiral soliton background at different parities and grand spins have been numerically evaluated, compared and discussed.</description>

      <title>Shell model description of the $N=82$ isotonic chain with a new effective interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic study of low-lying states and electromagnetic properties of the semi-magic $N = 82$ isotonic chain with proton number $Z=51$-77, using the full configuration interaction shell model with a newly developed high-quality effective interaction. The calculations are performed in a large model space that includes all proton orbitals between $Z = 50$ and 82: $0g_{7/2}$, $1d_{5/2}$, $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$, and $0h_{11/2}$. The effective interaction is derived through the principal component analysis approach, starting from 160 two-body matrix elements and 5 single-particle energies and considering up to 30 degrees of freedom. Those are optimized by fitting to 204 available experimental energy levels. The resulting root-mean-square deviation is as low as 102 keV. The new interaction successfully reproduces the binding energies, low-lying spectra, electric quadrupole transition probabilities $B(E2)$, and magnetic dipole moments across both even-even and odd-mass isotones. The nuclear structure of low-lying states is analyzed in detail. Additionally, predictions are made for several more proton-rich nuclei beyond current experimental reach, including $^{155}\mathrm{Ta}$, $^{156}\mathrm{W}$, $^{157}\mathrm{Re}$, $^{158}\mathrm{Os}$, and $^{159}\mathrm{Ir}$.</description>

      <title>Validity of relativistic hydrodynamics beyond local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium by constructing formal solutions of the Boltzmann moment equations in the relaxation time approximation. These solutions naturally decompose into a divergent gradient series and exponentially decaying non-perturbative modes that encode initial conditions. The non-perturbative contributions are essential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series, and the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium.
  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of non-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient expansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect both initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that hydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium, but because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective behavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable success of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

Abstract: The double pole singularity of the $S$-matrix, the so-called exceptional point, associated with the $5/2^-$ doublet of resonances in the spectrum of $^{7}$Be has been identified in the framework of the Gamow shell model. The exceptional point singularity is demonstrated by the coalescence of wave functions and spectral functions of the two resonances, as well as by the singular behavior of spectroscopic factors and electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ Asymptotics of the Leading-Twist Flavor Singlet Quark TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the small-$x$ behavior of the flavor-singlet, leading-twist quark Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) using the Light-Cone Operator Treatment. This formalism allows us to express TMD operators at small $x$ in terms of polarized dipole amplitudes, enabling a systematic approach to their small-$x$ evolution. We derive the evolution equations for these TMDs and solve them within the large-$N_c$ approximation under the linearized, Double-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA), where $N_c$ represents the number of quark colors. Expanding on previous work on unpolarized and helicity TMDs, we present the small-$x$ asymptotics for a comprehensive set of TMDs, including the Sivers function, helicity worm-gear, transversity, pretzelosity, Boer-Mulders, and transversity worm-gear distributions. Our results provide a complete picture of the small-$x$ asymptotic behavior for all leading-twist flavor-singlet quark TMDs. We also discuss the implications of our findings for phenomenological applications and outline potential avenues for further research, particularly in understanding non-linear effects and extending beyond the DLA and large-$N_c$ approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early stage of a heavy-ion collision is marked by rapid entropy production and the transition from a gluon saturated initial condition to a plasma of quarks and gluons that evolves hydrodynamically. However, during the early times of the hydrodynamic evolution, the chemical composition of the QCD medium is still largely unknown. We present a study of quark chemical equilibration in the (Q)GP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. Motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models, we initialize the QCD medium as a completely gluon dominated state. Local quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is then simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each independent quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. We present the results of complete heavy-ion collision simulations using this partial chemical equilibrium model, and show the effects on hadronic and electromagnetic observables. In particular, we show that the development of flow is sensitive to the equilibration timescale, providing an empirical way to probe the chemical equilibration of the QCD medium.</description>

Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>
