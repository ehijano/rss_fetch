      <title>Asymptotically well-balanced geostrophic reconstruction finite volumes numerical schemes for the 2D rotating NLSWE in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of large-scale geophysical fluids is primarily governed by the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient.
  This phenomenon, known as geostrophic equilibrium, is the basis for the geostrophic model, which has proven to be extremely useful for understanding and forecasting large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.
  In the present work, we develop second- and third-order finite-volume numerical schemes applied to the 2D rotating shallow-water equations in spherical coordinates. These schemes are designed to preserve the geostrophic equilibrium in the limit as the Rossby number tends to zero.
  The final goal is to design reliable and efficient forecasting models for simulating meteotsunamis, long-wave events generated in the ocean by atmospheric pressure disturbances. These disturbances produce long waves of small amplitude that gradually amplify as they approach the coast.
  The numerical results for various analytical and real-world test cases underscore the importance of maintaining geostrophic equilibrium over time.</description>

      <title>A Storm-Centric 250 m NEXRAD Level-II Dataset for High-Resolution ML Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based precipitation nowcasting relies on high-fidelity radar reflectivity sequences to model the short-term evolution of convective storms. However, the development of models capable of predicting extreme weather has been constrained by the coarse resolution (1-2 km) of existing public radar datasets, such as SEVIR, HKO-7, and GridRad-Severe, which smooth the fine-scale structures essential for accurate forecasting. To address this gap, we introduce Storm250-L2, a storm-centric radar dataset derived from NEXRAD Level-II and GridRad-Severe data. We algorithmically crop a fixed, high-resolution (250 m) window around GridRad-Severe storm tracks, preserve the native polar geometry, and provide temporally consistent sequences of both per-tilt sweeps and a pseudo-composite reflectivity product. The dataset comprises thousands of storm events across the continental United States, packaged in HDF5 tensors with rich context metadata and reproducible manifests.</description>

      <title>A purely analytical and physical wind turbine wake model accounting for atmospheric stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A purely analytical wake model for wind turbines is derived, anchored exclusively in physical interactions between atmospheric turbulence and turbine dynamics, and thus inherently accounting for atmospheric stratification. Unlike empirical models relying on assumed wake deficit shapes or tunable coefficients, this model predicts the wake deficit solely from measurable properties of the inflow, namely, turbulence intensity and the turbulence integral time scale. Systematic validation against Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for both IEA 15MW and NREL 5MW turbines, simulated in Meso-NH under stable, neutral, and unstable conditions, demonstrates excellent agreement across atmospheric regimes. Importantly, the model requires these specific turbulence statistics as input but shows only weak sensitivity to the integral time scale, ensuring robustness even with moderate uncertainties in inflow characterisation. Comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art Super-Gaussian analytical model highlights superior performance of the present approach, particularly for unstable and neutral stratification. These results show that the predictive accuracy gained by incorporating richer inflow physics justifies the need for more comprehensive atmospheric inputs, providing a clear pathway for physically grounded, calibration-free wake modeling in operational wind energy contexts.</description>

      <title>DAWP: A framework for global observation forecasting via Data Assimilation and Weather Prediction in satellite observation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning (CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP. Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in global precipitation forecasting.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence forecast for ground-based astronomy and free-space optical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting optical turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere has been an ambitious challenge for the astronomical scientific community for several decades. While earlier research primarily focused on whether it was possible to predict optical turbulence and its vertical distribution, current efforts are more concentrated on the accuracy achievable at different timescales, the efficiency of various forecasting methods and the contributions of new statistical approaches, such as auto-regression and machine learning to this field. In this contribution, I will present the state of the art of the research conducted by our group, positioned within the international research scenery. Most of our past activity has been primarily focused on ground-based astronomy but recent advancements in space research opened new opportunities for applications in the free-space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ensembles for Statistics of Tails at Conditionally Optimal Advance Split Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate science needs more efficient ways to study high-impact, low-probability extreme events, which are rare by definition and costly to simulate in large numbers. Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting use small perturbations to turn moderate events into a severe ones, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years, and thus enhance sample size. But the viability of this approach hinges on two open questions: (1) are boosted events representative of the yet-unrealized events? (2) How does this depend on the specific form of perturbation, i.e., timing and structure? Timing in particular is crucial for sudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a concrete optimization problem for the advance split time (AST) hyperparameter, and study it on an idealized but physically informative model system: passive tracer fluctuations in a turbulent channel, which captures key elements of midlatitude storm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can RES methods, in particular ``ensemble boosting'' equipped with a probability estimator and ``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting'', accurately and efficiently sample extreme events? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how does it depend on the event definition, in particular the target location and surrounding flow conditions? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?
  Our answers support RES as a viable method: (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail estimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales depending on location. (3) A ``thresholded entropy'' statistic is a good proxy for AST optimality, bypassing the tedious threshold-setting that often hinders RES methods. Our work clarifies aspects of the response function of transient extreme events to perturbations, giving a guide for designing efficient, reliable sampling strategies.</description>

      <title>Observation-guided Interpolation Using Graph Neural Networks for High-Resolution Nowcasting in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1km) and temporal (10 min) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed architecture combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We evaluate two models, one trained using local nowcasting analyses and one trained without, on multiple surface variables and compare it against operational high-resolution NWP (ICON-CH1) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. Results over the test period show that both GNNs consistently outperform ICON-CH1 when verified against INCA analyses across most variables and lead times. Relative to the INCA forecast system, scores against INCA analyses show AI gains beyond 2h (with early-lead disadvantages attributable to INCA's warm start from the analysis), while verification against held-out stations shows no systematic degradation at short lead-times for AI models and frequent outperformance across surface variables. A comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores for precipitation, pairwise significance testing and event-based evaluation, demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains. These results indicate that high-resolution, observation-guided GNNs can match or exceed the skill of established forecasting systems for short lead times, including when they are trained without nowcasting analyses.</description>
