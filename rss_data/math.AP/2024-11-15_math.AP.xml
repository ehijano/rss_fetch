      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and convergence problem of density functions of Boussinesq operator on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the maximal-in-time estimates and Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and convergence problem of density functions related to Boussinesq operator on manifolds. Firstly, we present the pointwise convergence of density function related to Boussinesq operator with $\gamma_{0}\in\mathfrak{S}^{\beta}(\dot{H}^{\frac{1}{4}}(\mathbf{R}))(\beta&lt;2)$ with the aid of the maximal-in-time estimate related to Boussinesq operator with orthonormal function on $\R$. Secondly, we present the pointwise convergence of density function related to Boussinesq operator with $\gamma_{0}\in\mathfrak{S}^{\beta}(\dot{H}^{s})(\frac{d}{4}\leq s&lt;\frac{d}{2},\, 0&lt;\alpha\leq d, 1\leq\beta&lt;\frac{\alpha}{d-2s})$ with the aid of the maximal-in-time estimates related to Boussinesq operator with orthonormal function on the unit ball $\mathbf{B}^{d}(d\geq1)$ established in this paper; we also present the Hausdorff dimension of the divergence set of density function related to Boussinesq operator $dim_{H}D(\gamma_{0})\leq (d-2s)\beta$. Thirdly, we show the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and Schatten bound with space-time norms related to Boussinesq operator on $\mathbf{T}$ with the aid of the noncommutative-commutative interpolation theorems established in this paper, which are just Lemmas 3.1-3.4 in this paper; we also prove that Theorems 1.5, 1.6 are optimal. Finally, by using full randomization, we present the probabilistic convergence of density function related to Boussinesq operator on $\R$, $\mathbf{T}$ and $\Theta=\{x\in\R^{3}:|x|&lt;1\}$ with $\gamma_{0}\in\mathfrak{S}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a one-dimensional fractional diffusion equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse problem of finding a time-dependent multiplier of the right-hand side of a time-fractional one-dimensional diffusion equation with variables coefficients in the case where the usual Cauchy, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary, and an integral overdetermination conditions are given. The overdetermination condition has the form of an integral with a weight over a spatial segment from the solution of the direct problem, in which the weight function is a spatially dependent known factor of the right-hand side of the equation. This made it possible to construct a solution to the inverse problem in explicit form and prove its correctness in the class of regular solutions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equation in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equation in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A(z)\,{\rm grad}\, u(z) = 0$, $z=x+iy$, with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of its solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>

      <title>Global attractor and robust exponential attractors for some classes of fourth-order nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to some classes of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs with non-monotone nonlinearities, which include the Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation (with all relevant fields and spin torques) and the convective Cahn--Hilliard/Allen--Cahn (CH-AC) equation with a proliferation term, in dimensions $d=1,2,3$. Firstly, we show the global well-posedness, as well as the existence of global and exponential attractors with finite fractal dimensions for these problems. In the case of the exchange-dominated LLBar equation and the CH-AC equation without convection, an estimate for the rate of convergence of the solution to the corresponding stationary state is given. Finally, we show the existence of a robust family of exponential attractors when $d\leq 2$. As a corollary, exponential attractor of the LLBar equation is shown to converge to that of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation in the limit of vanishing exchange damping, while exponential attractor of the convective CH-AC equation is shown to converge to that of the convective Allen--Cahn equation in the limit of vanishing diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Weak* Solutions: A Convergent Front Tracking Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variation of the Front Tracking (FT) method for modeling solutions to hyperbolic systems in one space dimension, a Modified FT scheme. Instead of using non-entropic shocks, we approximate simple waves by jumps which exactly match the states, while approximating the wave speed. Our construction makes use of compression curve as well. We work with weak* solutions introduced in \cite{}. Consequently, we are able to analyze residuals rather than errors, and obtain cleaner convergence results. Through this paper, we intend to set up a scheme that is capable of handling strong shocks consistently. We develop this scheme primarily to prove (in a future work) existence of large amplitude solutions of the p-system. Therefore, we treat the p-system more carefully and construct a completely self-sufficient scheme, which has a limit as long as the approximate weak* solutions have uniformly bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Behavior towards Shock Profiles for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of shock profiles in one spatial dimension for the isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson (NSP) system, which describes the dynamics of ions in a collision-dominated plasma. The NSP system admits a one-parameter family of smooth traveling waves, called shock profiles, for a given far-field condition satisfying the Lax entropy condition. In this paper, we prove that if the initial data is sufficiently close to a shock profile in $H^2$-norm, then the global solution of the Cauchy problem tends to the smooth manifold formed by the parametrized shock profiles as time goes to infinity. This is achieved using the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, which does not require the zero mass condition.</description>

      <title>A Method to Extrapolate the Data for the Inverse Magnetisation Problem with a Planar Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particular instance of the inverse magnetisation problem is considered. It is assumed that the support of a magnetic sample (a source term in the Poisson equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$) is contained in a bounded planar set parallel to the measurement plane. Moreover, only one component of the magnetic field is assumed to be known (measured) over the same planar region in the measurement plane. We propose a method to extrapolate the measurement data to the whole plane relying on the knowledge of the forward operator and the geometry of the problem. The method is based on the spectral decomposition of an auxiliary matrix-function operator. The results are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>The Nelson conjecture and chain rule property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\ge 1$ and let $\mathbf v \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d$ be a compactly supported vector field with $\mathbf v \in L^p(\mathbb R^d)$ and $\operatorname{div} \mathbf v = 0$ (in the sense of distributions). It was conjectured by Nelson that it $p=2$ then the operator $\mathsf{A}(\rho) := \mathbf v \cdot \nabla \rho$ with the domain $D(\mathsf A)=C_0^\infty(\mathbb R^d)$ is essentially skew-adjoint on $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$. A counterexample to this conjecture for $d\ge 3$ was constructed by Aizenmann. From recent results of Alberti, Bianchini, Crippa and Panov it follows that this conjecture is false even for $d=2$.
  Nevertheless, we prove that for $d=2$ the condition $p\ge 2$ is necessary and sufficient for the following chain rule property of $\mathbf v$: for any $\rho \in L^\infty(\mathbb R^2)$ and any $\beta\in C^1(\mathbb R)$ the equality $\operatorname{div}(\rho \mathbf v) = 0$ implies that $\operatorname{div}(\beta(\rho) \mathbf v) = 0$.
  Furthermore, for $d=2$ we prove that $\mathbf v$ has the renormalization property if and only if the stream function (Hamiltonian) of $\mathbf v$ has the weak Sard property, and that both of the properties are equivalent to uniqueness of bounded weak solutions to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding continuity equation. These results generalize the criteria established for $d=2$ and $p=\infty$ by Alberti, Bianchini and Crippa.</description>

      <title>A note on Ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics with perfectly conducting boundary conditions in the quarter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem in the quarter space for the system of equations of ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics for compressible fluids with perfectly conducting wall boundary conditions. On the two parts of the boundary the solution satisfies different boundary conditions, which make the problem an initial-boundary value problem with non-uniformly characteristic boundary.
  We identify a subspace ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$ of the Sobolev space $H^3(\Omega)$, obtained by addition of suitable boundary conditions on one portion of the boundary, such that for initial data in ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$ there exists a solution in the same space ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$, for all times in a small time interval. This yields the well-posedness of the problem combined with a persistence property of full $H^3$-regularity, although in general we expect a loss of normal regularity near the boundary. Thanks to the special geometry of the quarter space the proof easily follows by the "reflection technique".</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering problems for non-linear wave equations on Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an inverse scattering problem for a semilinear wave equation can be solved on a manifold having an asymptotically Minkowskian infinity, that is, scattering functionals determine the topology, differentiable structure and the conformal type of the manifold. Moreover, the metric and the coefficient of the non-linearity are determined up to a multiplicative transformation. The manifold on which the inverse problem is considered is allowed to be an open, globally hyperbolic manifold which may have bifurcate event horizons or several infinities (i.e., ends) of which at least one has to be of the asymptotically Minkowskian type. The results are applied also for FLRW space-times that have no particle horizons. To formulate the inverse problems we define a new type of data, non-linear scattering functionals, which are defined also in the cases when the classically defined scattering operator is not well defined. This makes it possible to solve the inverse problems also in the case when some of the incoming waves lead to a blow-up of the scattered solution.</description>

Abstract: We give $L^p$ estimates for the second derivatives of weak solutions to the Dirichlet problem for equation $\Div(\mathbf{A}\nabla u) = f$ in $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with Sobolev coefficients. In particular, for $f\in L^2(\Omega) \bigcap L^s(\Omega)$ $$\|\Delta u\|_{2} \leq \begin{cases} c_1\|f\|_2 + c_2 \|\nabla \mathbf{A}\|_q^2\|f\|_s, &amp; \text{if } 1 &lt; s &lt; d/2, \frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{q}+ \frac{1}{s} - \frac{2}{d}\\ c_1\|f\|_2 + c_2 \|\nabla \mathbf{A}\|_4^2\|f\|_s, &amp; \text{if } s &gt; d/2 \end{cases}.$$</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for a degenerate triangular reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study a reaction diffusion system with $m$ unknown concentration. The non-linearity in our study comes from an underlying reversible chemical reaction and triangular in nature. Our objective is to understand the large time behaviour of solution where there are degeneracies. In particular we treat those cases when one of the diffusion coefficient is zero and others are strictly positive. We prove convergence to equilibrium type of results under some condition on stoichiometric coefficients in dimension $1$,$2$ and $3$ in correspondence with the existence of classical solution. For dimension greater than 3 we prove similar result under certain closeness condition on the non-zero diffusion coefficients and with the same condition imposed on stoichiometric coefficients. All the constant occurs in the decay estimates are explicit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a quasi-incompressible Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes system (qCHNS) for two-phase flows with unmatched densities. The order parameter is the volume fraction difference of the two fluids, while mass-averaged velocity is adopted. This leads to a quasi-incompressible model where the pressure also enters the equation of the chemical potential. We establish local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions by the Banach fixed point theorem and the maximal regularity theory.</description>

      <title>Structure-informed operator learning for parabolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for learning the solution map of a backward parabolic Cauchy problem. The solution depends continuously but nonlinearly on the final data, source, and force terms, all residing in Banach spaces of functions. We utilize Fr\'echet space neural networks (Benth et al. (2023)) to address this operator learning problem. Our approach provides an alternative to Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), using basis functions to span the relevant function spaces rather than relying on finite-dimensional approximations through censoring. With this method, structural information encoded in the basis coefficients is leveraged in the learning process. This results in a neural network designed to learn the mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Our numerical proof-of-concept demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, highlighting some advantages over DeepONets.</description>

      <title>Lattice-based stochastic models motivate non-linear diffusion descriptions of memory-based dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of memory and cognition in the movement of individuals (e.g. animals) within a population, is thought to play an important role in population dispersal. In response, there has been increasing interest in incorporating spatial memory effects into classical partial differential equation (PDE) models of animal dispersal. However, the specific detail of the transport terms, such as diffusion and advection terms, that ought to be incorporated into PDE models to accurately reflect the memory effect remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose a straightforward lattice-based model where the movement of individuals depends on both crowding effects and the historic distribution within the simulation. The advantage of working with the individual-based model is that it is straightforward to propose and implement memory effects within the simulation in a way that is more biologically intuitive than simply proposing heuristic extensions of classical PDE models. Through deriving the continuum limit description of our stochastic model, we obtain a novel nonlinear diffusion equation which encompasses memory-based diffusion terms. For the first time we reveal the relationship between memory-based diffusion and the individual-based movement mechanisms that depend upon memory effects. Through repeated stochastic simulation and numerical explorations of the mean-field PDE model, we show that the new PDE model accurately describes the expected behaviour of the stochastic model, and we also explore how memory effects impact population dispersal.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonlinear scalar field on strongly charged asymptotically AdS black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge and the choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black hole let us suspect that similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Regularization in Kazantsev-Kraichnan Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a passive vector field which is transported and stretched by a divergence-free Gaussian velocity field, delta-correlated in time and poorly correlated in space (spatially nonsmooth). Although the advection of a scalar field (Kraichnan's passive scalar model) is known to enjoy regularizing properties, the potentially competing stretching term in vector advection may induce singularity formation. We establish that the regularization effect is actually retained in certain regimes. While this is true in any dimension $d\ge 3$, it notably implies a regularization result for linearized 3D Euler equations with stochastic modeling of turbulent velocities, and for the induction equation in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Analysis and discretization of the Ohta-Kawasaki equation with forcing and degenerate mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ohta-Kawasaki equation models the mesoscopic phase separation of immiscible polymer chains that form diblock copolymers, with applications in directed self-assembly for lithography. We perform a mathematical analysis of this model under degenerate mobility and an external force, proving the existence of weak solutions via an approximation scheme for the mobility function. Additionally, we propose a fully discrete scheme for the system and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of its discrete solution, showing that it inherits essential structural-preserving properties. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to compare the Ohta-Kawasaki system with the classical Cahn-Hilliard model, highlighting the impact of the repulsion parameter on the phase separation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: [1] M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N. Nadirashvili. On the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on surfaces. Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48. [2] T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, P. Michor, and N. Nadirashvili. Bounds on the multiplicity of eigenvalues for fixed membranes. Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k(M))$ of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In [1], $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In [2], $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in [1,2] are not very detailed, and often rely on figures or special configurations of nodal sets. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof that $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations up to $\mathbf{\mathbb{R}^9}$: full quantitative proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides quantitative proofs of the results obtained in [Cabr\'e, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)], a work that proved the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n\leq 9$. Some results in that paper were established through compactness proofs, arguing by contradiction -- the boundary regularity arguments being specially delicate. Here we provide proofs that do not rely on compactness and, in particular, allow to quantify the H\"older regularity exponent. For this, we use two new estimates from [Cabr\'e, arXiv:2211.13033] which control the solution in $L^1$ by the $L^1$ norm of its radial derivative.
  For expository purposes, we provide self-contained proofs of the full H\"older regularity results. They only involve basic Analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Atomistic-to-continuum convergence for quasi-static crack growth in brittle materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the atomistic-to-continuum limit for a model of a quasi-static crack evolution driven by time-dependent boundary conditions. We consider a two-dimensional atomic mass spring system whose interactions are modeled by classical interaction potentials, supplemented by a suitable irreversibility condition accounting for the breaking of atmoic bonding. In a simultaneous limit of vanishing interatomic distance and discretized time step, we identify a continuum model of quasi-static crack growth in brittle fracture featuring an irreversibility condition, a global stability, and an energy balance. The proof of global stability relies on a careful adaptation of the jump-transfer argument by Francfort and Larsen to the atomistic setting.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric inviscid fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal paper (Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 282, (1984).), the regularity of the free boundary of two-phase fluid in two dimensions via the so-called ACF energy functional was investigated. It was shown the $C^1$ regularity of the free boundaries and asserted that the two free boundaries coincide under some additional assumptions. Later on the standard technique of Harnack inequality could be applied to improve the regularity to $C^{1,\eta}$. A recent significant breakthrough in the regularity of two-phase fluid is due to De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, who investigated the free boundary of the two-phase fluid with the two-phase functional (De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, Invent. Math., 225, (2021).), and the $C^{1,\eta}$ regularity of the whole free boundaries was given in dimension two. Moreover, the free boundaries of the two-phase fluids do not coincide and the zero level set may process positive Lebesgue measure. In this paper, we consider the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric fluid and show the free boundary is $C^{1,\eta}$ smooth. The Lebesgue measure of the zero level set of may also be positive, and the main difference lies in the degenerate elliptic operator and the free boundary conditions. More precisely, we use partial boundary Harnack inequalities and establish a linearized problem, whose regularity of the solutions implies the flatness decay of the two-phase free boundaries. Then the iteration argument gives the smoothness of the free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Long time derivation of the Boltzmann equation from hard sphere dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of Boltzmann's kinetic equation from the hard-sphere system for rarefied gas, which is valid for arbitrarily long time as long as the solution to the Boltzmann equation exists. This extends Lanford's landmark theorem (1975) which justifies such derivation for sufficiently short time, and is a crucial step towards resolving Hilbert's sixth problem.
  The general strategy follows the paradigm introduced by the first two authors for the long-time derivation of the wave kinetic equation in wave turbulence theory. This is based on propagating a long-time cumulant ansatz, which keeps memory of the full collision history of the relevant particles. The heart of the matter is proving the smallness of these cumulants in L1, which can be reduced to combinatorial properties for the associated Feynman diagrams, called collision history (CH) molecules. The latter is then proved by devising an elaborate cutting algorithm, which is a major novelty of this work.</description>

      <title>Weak parabolic Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity for non-local Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give equivalent conditions for the weak parabolic Harnack inequality for general regular Dirichlet forms without killing part, in terms of local heat kernel estimates or growth lemmas. With a tail estimate on the jump measure, we obtain from these conditions the H\"older continuity of caloric and harmonic functions. Our results generalize the theory of Chen, Kumagai and Wang, in the sense that the upper jumping smoothness condition is canceled. We also derive the complete forms of Harnack inequalities from the globally non-negative versions, and obtain continuity of caloric functions with worse tails.</description>

      <title>On hydrostatic limit of Beris-Edwards system in a thin strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the 3D co-rotational Beris-Edwards system modeling the hydrodynamic motion of nematic liquid crystals in a thin strip. The system contains the incompressible Navier-Stokes, coupled with a parabolic system for matrix-valued functions, the $Q$-tensors.
  We show that under a suitable scaling, corresponding, in the Navier-Stokes part, to the hydrostatic scaling, one obtains in the limit a partly decoupled system. For the fluid part we obtain the Prandtl system while for the $Q$-tensors we obtain a non-standard system, involving fluids components and a non-standard combination of partly dissipative equations and algebraic constraints.
  We prove the convergence of the rescaled system and the well-posedness of the limit in Sobolev spaces.</description>

The method of cluster expansions of the groups of operators of the Liouville equations for observables and a state is used to establish the generating operators of expansions representing solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy (Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) as well as of the dual BBGKY hierarchy, respectively.</description>
