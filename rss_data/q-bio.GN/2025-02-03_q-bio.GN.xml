      <title>Constructing Cell-type Taxonomy by Optimal Transport with Relaxed Marginal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of single-cell data has facilitated the study of many different biological conditions at the cellular level. Cluster analysis has been widely applied to identify cell types, capturing the essential patterns of the original data in a much more concise form. One challenge in the cluster analysis of cells is matching clusters extracted from datasets of different origins or conditions. Many existing algorithms cannot recognize new cell types present in only one of the two samples when establishing a correspondence between clusters obtained from two samples. Additionally, when there are more than two samples, it is advantageous to align clusters across all samples simultaneously rather than performing pairwise alignment. Our approach aims to construct a taxonomy for cell clusters across all samples to better annotate these clusters and effectively extract features for downstream analysis. A new system for constructing cell-type taxonomy has been developed by combining the technique of Optimal Transport with Relaxed Marginal Constraints (OT-RMC) and the simultaneous alignment of clusters across multiple samples. OT-RMC allows us to address challenges that arise when the proportions of clusters vary substantially between samples or when some clusters do not appear in all the samples. Experiments on more than twenty datasets demonstrate that the taxonomy constructed by this new system can yield highly accurate annotation of cell types. Additionally, sample-level features extracted based on the taxonomy result in accurate classification of samples.</description>

      <title>Survey and Improvement Strategies for Gene Prioritization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.</description>

      <title>A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.</description>

      <title>pasta: Pattern Analysis for Spatial Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.</description>
