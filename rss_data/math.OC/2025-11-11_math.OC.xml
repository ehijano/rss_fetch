      <title>An Overview of Some Extensions of Mean Field Games beyond Perfect Homogeneity and Anonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean field games (MFG) paradigm was introduced to provide tractable approximations of games involving very large populations. The theory typically rests on two key assumptions: homogeneity, meaning that all players share the same dynamics and cost functions, and anonymity, meaning that each player interacts with others only through their empirical distribution. While these assumptions simplify the analysis, they can be restrictive for many applications. Fortunately, several extensions of the standard MFG framework that relax these assumptions have been developed in the literature. The purpose of these notes is to offer a pedagogical introduction to such models. In particular, we discuss multi-population MFGs, graphon MFGs, major-minor MFGs, and Stackelberg MFGs, as well as variants involving cooperative players.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Global Search Framework for the Design Optimization of Fabrication-Constrained Freeform Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although freeform devices with complex internal structures promise drastic increases in performance, the discreteness of the set of available materials presents challenges for gradient-based optimization necessary for the efficient exploration of the high-dimensional freeform parameter space. Several schemes have been devised to utilize a continuous latent parameter space that maps to actual discrete designs, but none thus far simultaneously achieves full differentiability and strictly feasible material choices during optimization. Here, we propose the Gaussian ensemble gradient descent framework, which transforms the piecewise-constant fabrication-constrained cost function by convolution with a Gaussian kernel to render it differentiable. The transformed cost and gradient are estimated through ensemble sampling, which is combined with variance reduction methods that greatly improve the sampling efficiency in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Furthermore, the use of ensemble sampling within a gradient descent framework leads to the effective hybridization of the exploration and exploitation strengths of population- and gradient-based methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Cloven Traveling Salesman: Cycle Covers and the Integrality Gap of Small ATSP Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel enumeration algorithm for computing the integrality gap of small instances of the subtour elimination formulation for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). The core idea is to enumerate pairs of vertex-disjoint cycle covers that can be filtered and mapped to half-integer vertices of the subtour elimination polytope. The two-cycle covers are encoded as lexicographically ordered partitions of $n$ numbers, with an encoding that prevents the generation of several isomorphic vertices. However, since not every cycle cover pair can be mapped to a vertex of the subtour elimination polytope, we have designed an efficient property-checking procedure to control whether a given point is a vertex of the asymmetric subtour elimination polytope. The proposed approach turns upside down the algorithms presented in the literature that first generate every possible vertex and later filter isomorphic vertices. With our approach, we can replicate state-of-the-art results for n&lt;=9 in a tiny fraction of time, and we compute for the first time the exact integrality gap of half-integer vertices of the asymmetric subtour elimination polytope for n=10, 11, 12.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization on Spherical Surfaces: Continuous and Discrete Models - A Beginner-Friendly Expository Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository paper provides a unified and pedagogical introduction to optimal quantization for probability measures supported on spherical surfaces, emphasizing both continuous and discrete settings. We first present a detailed geometric and analytical foundation of quantization on the unit sphere, including definitions of great and small circles, spherical triangles, geodesic distance, Slerp interpolation, the Fr\'echet mean, spherical Voronoi regions, centroid conditions, and quantization dimensions. Building upon this framework, we develop explicit continuous and discrete quantization models on spherical curves -great circles, small circles, and great circular arcs -supported by rigorous derivations and pedagogical exposition. For uniform continuous distributions, we compute optimal sets of $n$-means and the associated quantization errors on these curves; for discrete distributions, we analyze antipodal, equatorial, tetrahedral, and finite uniform configurations, illustrating convergence to the continuous model. The central conclusion is that for a uniform probability distribution supported on a one-dimensional geodesic subset of total length $L$, the optimal $n$-means form a uniform partition and the quantization error satisfies $V_n = L^2/(12n^2)$. The exposition emphasizes geometric intuition, detailed derivations, and clear step-by-step reasoning, making it accessible to beginning graduate students and researchers entering the study of quantization on manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Zeroth-order Resilient Algorithm for Distributed Online Optimization against Byzantine Edge Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order resilient distributed online algorithm for networks under Byzantine edge attacks. We assume that both the edges attacked by Byzantine adversaries and the objective function are time-varying. Moreover, we focus on the scenario where the complete time-varying objective function cannot be observed, and only its value at a certain point is available. Using deterministic difference, we design a zeroth-order distributed online optimization algorithm against Byzantine edge attacks and provide an upper bound on the dynamic regret of the algorithm. Finally, a simulation example is given justifying the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the smooth Lorentzian optimal transport problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we want to establish some general results in the Lorentzian optimal transport theory that have well-known Riemannian counterparts. As a first result, we will provide non-trivial assumptions on the measures to ensure strong (Kantorovich) duality, i.e. the existence of a maximizing pair in the dual optimal transport formulation. We will also show that, under suitable assumptions, optimality of a causal coupling is characterized by $c$-cyclical monotonicity. The second result deals with the regularity of $c$-convex functions and (weak) Kantorovich potentials. We show that, in general, regularity results known in the Riemannian context do not extend to the Lorentzian setting. Under suitable assumptions on the measures, we will prove nevertheless that these (weak) potentials are locally semconvex on an open set of full measure. As our last result, we will prove that, under quite general assumptions, for any two intermediates measures along a displacement interpolation, there exists a $C^{1,1}_{loc}$-regular maximizing pair in the dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Both Consensus and Optimality in Decentralized Nonconvex Optimization with Multiple Local Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable decentralized optimization in large-scale systems hinges on efficient communication. A common way to reduce communication overhead is to perform multiple local updates between two communication rounds, as in federated learning. However, extending this strategy to fully decentralized settings poses fundamental challenges. Existing decentralized algorithms with multiple local updates guarantee accurate convergence only under strong convexity, limiting applicability to the nonconvex problems prevalent in machine learning. Moreover, many methods require exchanging and storing auxiliary variables, such as gradient-tracking vectors or correction terms, to ensure convergence under data heterogeneity, incurring high communication and memory costs. In this paper, we propose MILE, a fully decentralized algorithm that guarantees both consensus and optimality under multiple local updates in general nonconvex settings. This is achieved through a novel periodic-system-based formulation and a lifting-based analysis, which together yield a closed-form expression for the state evolution across local updates, a theoretical advance not achieved previously. This closed-form characterization allows us to establish, for the first time, guaranteed consensus and optimality in decentralized nonconvex optimization under multiple local updates, in contrast to prior results that only ensure optimality of the average state. We prove that MILE achieves an $O(1/T)$ convergence rate under both exact and stochastic gradients, while requiring only a single variable exchange per interacting agent pair, minimizing communication and memory costs. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets confirm its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical Approach to Trajectory Optimization for Stacker Cranes Regarding Energy Saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to give insights into the trajectory optimization w.r.t. energy consumption and recuperation for stacker cranes in a high-bay warehouse. Based on an analytical necessary optimality condition, a targeted numerical implementation is set up to perform systematic computations of optimal trajectories which are further categorized. Particularly, the differences between energy consumption and recuperation as well as for up and down movements are pointed out. Although examined for a concrete, experimentally validated model of stacker cranes, the methodical approach could be adapted to other electrical machines possessing a power flow model, i.e. a functional relation between the kinematics (velocity, acceleration for instance) and the resultant power. In addition, boundaries of the velocity, the acceleration and the jerk are incorporated. Such a systematic analysis of energy optimal trajectories can be further used for improving the job scheduling in a warehouse.</description>

      <title>An efficient proximal algorithm for squared L1 over L2 regularized sparse recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a squared $L_1/L_2$ regularized model for sparse signal recovery from noisy measurements. We first establish the existence of optimal solutions to the model under mild conditions. Next, we propose a proximal method for solving a general fractional optimization problem which has the squared $L_1/L_2$ regularized model as a special case. We prove that any accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by the proposed method is a critical point of the fractional optimization problem. Under additional KL assumptions on some potential function, we establish the sequential convergence of the proposed method. When this method is specialized to the squared $L_1/L_2$ regularized model, the proximal operator involved in each iteration admits a simple closed form solution that can be computed with very low computational cost. Furthermore, for each of the three concrete models, the solution sequence generated by this specialized algorithm converges to a critical point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm for sparse recovery based on squared $L_1/L_2$ regularization.</description>

      <title>Convex semidefinite tensor optimization and quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cone of positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrices is fundamental in convex optimization, and we extend this notion to tensors, defining PSD tensors, which correspond to separable quantum states. We study the convex optimization problem over the PSD tensor cone. While this convex cone admits a smooth reparameterization through tensor factorizations (analogous to the matrix case), it is not self-dual. Moreover, there are currently no efficient algorithms for projecting onto or testing membership in this cone, and the semidefinite tensor optimization problem, although convex, is NP-hard. To address these challenges, we develop methods for computing lower and upper bounds on the optimal value of the problem. We propose a general-purpose iterative refinement algorithm that combines a lifted alternating direction method of multipliers with a cutting-plane approach. This algorithm exploits PSD tensor factorizations to produce heuristic solutions and refine the solutions using cutting planes. Since the method requires a linear minimization oracle over PSD tensors, we design a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on convex relaxations and valid inequalities. Our framework allows us to study the white-noise mixing threshold, which characterizes the entanglement properties of quantum states. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Competitive optimal portfolio selection under mean-variance criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a portfolio selection problem involving multi competitive agents, each exhibiting mean-variance preferences. Unlike classical models, each agent's utility is determined by their relative wealth compared to the average wealth of all agents, introducing a competitive dynamic into the optimization framework. To address this game-theoretic problem, we first reformulate the mean-variance criterion as a constrained, non-homogeneous stochastic linear-quadratic control problem and derive the corresponding optimal feedback strategies. The existence of Nash equilibria is shown to depend on the well-posedness of a complex, coupled system of equations. Employing decoupling techniques, we reduce the well-posedness analysis to the solvability of a novel class of multi-dimensional linear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). We solve a new type of nonlinear BSDEs (including the above linear one as a special case) using fixed-point theory. Depending on the interplay between market and competition parameters, three distinct scenarios arise: (i) the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium, (ii) the absence of any Nash equilibrium, and (iii) the existence of infinitely many Nash equilibria. These scenarios are rigorously characterized and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Decentralized Optimization via Double-Communication Symmetric ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on decentralized composite optimization over networks without a central coordinator. We propose a novel decentralized Symmetric ADMM algorithm that incorporates multiple communication rounds within each iteration, derived from a new constraint formulation that enables information exchange beyond immediate neighbors. While increasing per-iteration communication, our approach significantly reduces the total number of iterations and overall communication cost. We further design optimal communication rules that minimize the number of rounds and variables transmitted per iteration. The proposed algorithms are shown to achieve linear convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing decentralized optimization methods. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized optimization framework that achieves a net reduction in total communication by leveraging fixed multi-round communication within each iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An energy community is modeled as a cooperative game, where a veto player is needed beyond the prosumers to manage the community, and the worth of a coalition is its benefit compared to the selfish behaviour of the prosumers. Properties of the game such as superadditivity, monotonicity, convexity and balancedness are analyzed both in the presence and absence of admission fees. Then, the least core and its value are studied in detail, underlying the differences between the cases where the game is balanced or not. In particular, exact formulas and computable bounds for the least core value are provided. Finally, the maximum and minimum reward in the least core for the veto player are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Convexity and strict convexity for compositional neural networks in high-dimensional optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems. In particular, their compositional structure has been shown to enable efficient approximation of high-dimensional functions, helping to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in optimal control problems. In this work, we build upon the theoretical framework developed by Kang &amp; Gong (SIAM J. Control Optim. 60(2):786-813, 2022), particularly their results on NN approximations for compositional functions in optimal control. Theorem 6.2 in Kang &amp; Gong (SIAM J. Control Optim. 60(2):786-813, 2022) establishes that, under suitable assumptions on the compositional structure and its associated features, optimal control problems with strictly convex cost functionals admit a curse-of-dimensionality-free approximation of the optimal control by NNs. We extend this result in two directions. First, we analyze the strict convexity requirement on the cost functional and demonstrate that reformulating a discrete-time optimal control problem with linear transitions and stage costs as a terminal cost problem ensures the necessary strict convexity. Second, we establish a generalization of Theorem 6.2 in Kang &amp; Gong (SIAM J. Control Optim. 60(2):786-813, 2022) which provides weak error bounds for optimal control approximations by NNs when the cost functional is only convex rather than strictly convex.</description>

      <title>Subdifferentials of Convex Operators Valued in the Space of Integrable Functions with Application to Risk-Averse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differentiability properties of convex operators defined on a Banach space with values in an $\Lc_p$ space and of their compositions with monotonic convex functionals on this space. We develop new tools for operators enjoying an additional feature known as the local property. The new approach and results go beyond the classical theory of normal integrands and lattice-valued operators. We further describe the subdifferentials of compositions of such operators with convex monotonic functionals. The new results are applied to obtain novel optimality conditions in the subdifferential form for a broad class of risk-averse stochastic optimization problems with risk functionals as objectives, with partial information, and with stochastic dominance constraints. While our analysis is motivated by the theory and methods of risk-averse optimization, it addresses problems of a more general structure and has potential for further applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the decay of an objective functional using a new control technique within Pontryagin's framework. Convergence analysis is carried out on the infinite-dimensional space of Tokamak plasma dynamical state as described by weakly decoupled nonlinear partial differential equations. An adjoint-based optimal control is derived to minimize the deviation from a predefined dynamical trajectory leading to the desired target state at stationary regime, by turning Pontryagin's transversality conditions into a continuum of horizons. A feedback controller is proposed to steer the system efficiently in real time, as opposed to an open-loop controller resulting from the classical Pontryagin's setting. An algorithm synthesizing the constraint-free optimal controller is used for profile tracking based on experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Scenario-Spatial Decomposition Approach With a Performance Guarantee for the Combined Bidding of Cascaded Hydropower and Renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a scalable co-optimization strategy for the joint bidding of cascaded hydropower, wind, and solar energy units, treated as a unified entity in the day-ahead market. Although hydropower flexibility can manage the stochasticity of renewable energy, the underlying bidding problem is complex due to intricate coupling constraints and nonlinear dynamics. A decomposition in both scenario and spatial dimensions is proposed, enabling the use of distributed optimization. The proposed distributed algorithm is eventually a heuristic due to non-convexities arising from the system's physical dynamics. To ensure a performance guarantee, trustworthy upper and lower bounds on the global optimum are derived, and a mathematical proof is provided to demonstrate their existence and validity. This approach reduces the average runtime by up to 35% compared to alternative distributed methods and by 57% compared to the centralized optimization. Moreover, it consistently delivers solutions, whereas both centralized and alternative distributed approaches fail as the size of the optimization problem grows.</description>

Abstract: We report about the algorithm, implementation and results submitted to the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024 by Team Twente, which scored third in the competition. Our approach combines mixed-integer programming, constraint programming and simulated annealing in a 3-phase solution approach based on decomposition into subproblems. Next to describing our approach and describing our design decisions, we share our insights and, for the first time, lower bounds on the optimal solution values for the benchmark instances.

      <title>Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term. We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape calculus.</description>

      <title>Variational models of robust optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two variational formulations for a model of robust optimal transport, that is, the problem of designing optimal transport networks that are resilient to potential damages, balancing construction costs against the benefit of maintaining partial functionality when parts of the network are damaged. We propose a Eulerian formulation, where the network is modeled by a rectifiable measure and recovery plans are represented by 1-dimensional normal currents. This framework allows for changes in the direction of the transportation in response to damages but restricts damages to be characteristic functions of closed sets. We also propose a Lagrangian formulation, where the network is a traffic plan (that is, a measure on the space of Lipschitz curves) and recovery plans are sub-traffic plans. This approach prescribes the network's orientation but allows for a wider class of damages. We prove existence of minimizers in both settings. The two models are compared through examples that illustrate their main differences: the Eulerian formulation's necessity for an unoriented network to achieve existence, the Lagrangian formulation's ability to handle general damages and its requirement for a positive distance between the supports of the source and target measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within each cluster.</description>

      <title>Centralized Reduction of Decentralized Stochastic Control Models and their weak-Feller Regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems involving general state/measurement/action spaces are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized (single-agent) stochastic control. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with standard Borel spaces under two different but tightly related information structures: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern (OSDISP), and the $K$-step periodic information sharing pattern (KSPISP). We will show that the one-step delayed and $K$-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized Markov Decision Process (MDP), generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability and topological questions. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller. The existence and separated nature of optimal policies under both information structures are then established. The weak Feller regularity also facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results, as shown in the paper.</description>

      <title>Spanning and Splitting: Integer Semidefinite Programming for the Quadratic Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP) one wants to find the minimizer of a quadratic function over all possible spanning trees of a graph. We present a formulation of the QMSTP as a mixed-integer semidefinite program exploiting the algebraic connectivity of a graph. Based on this formulation, we derive a doubly nonnegative relaxation for the QMSTP and investigate classes of valid inequalities to strengthen the relaxation using the Chv\'atal-Gomory procedure for mixed-integer conic programming. Solving the resulting relaxations is out of reach for off-the-shelf software. We therefore develop and implement a version of the Peaceman-Rachford splitting method that allows to compute the new bounds for graphs from the literature. The computational results demonstrate that our bounds significantly improve over existing bounds from the literature in both quality and computation time, in particular for graphs with more than 30 vertices. This work is further evidence that semidefinite programming is a valuable tool to obtain high-quality bounds for problems in combinatorial optimization, in particular for those that can be modelled as a quadratic problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly account for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving a nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Joint Bundle Design and Pricing for Extended Warranty Providers Servicing Multi-Tier Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended warranties (EWs) constitute a significant source of revenue for capital-intensive products. Such products comprise multiple subsystems, enabling flexible EW design. For example, providers can bundle tailored sets of subsystems within different EW contracts, facilitating the creation of a service menu with differentiated warranty options. From the perspective of a third-party EW provider servicing multi-tier products, we develop a novel model to jointly optimize bundle design and pricing for EW options in order to maximize the expected total profit. Specifically, the problem involves determining which contracts-each containing a differentiated bundle of subsystems-to recommend for the multi-tier products and identifying the appropriate price for each contract. As the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of subsystems, we devise two solution approaches. The first approach leverages a mixed-integer second-order cone programming reformulation, which guarantees optimality but is applicable only for a small number of subsystems. The second approach utilizes an iterative two-step process, offering enhanced computational efficiency for scenarios involving a large number of subsystems. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in scenarios characterized by high failure probabilities and a large number of subsystems.</description>

      <title>Integrated demand-side management and timetabling for an urban rail transit line: A Benders decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intelligent upgrading of metropolitan rail transit systems has made it feasible to implement demand-side management policies that integrate multiple operational strategies in practical operations. However, the tight interdependence between supply and demand necessitates a coordinated approach combining demand-side management policies and supply-side resource allocations to enhance the urban rail transit ecosystem. In this study, we propose a mathematical and computational framework that optimizes train timetables, passenger flow control strategies, and trip-shifting plans through the pricing policy. Our framework incorporates an emerging trip-booking approach that transforms waiting at the stations into waiting at home, thereby mitigating station overcrowding. Additionally, it ensures service fairness by maintaining an equitable likelihood of delays across different stations. We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming model, aiming to minimize passengers' waiting time and government subsidies required to offset revenue losses from fare discounts used to encourage trip shifting. To improve the computational efficiency, we develop a Benders decomposition-based algorithm within the branch-and-cut method, which decomposes the model into train timetabling with partial passenger assignment and passenger flow control subproblems. We propose valid inequalities based on our model's properties to strengthen the linear relaxation bounds at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Computational results from proof-of-concept and real-world case studies on the Beijing metro show that our solution method outperforms commercial solvers in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game of Controls with State Reflections: Existence and Limit Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies mean field game (MFG) of controls by featuring the joint distribution of the state and the control with the reflected state process along an exogenous stochastic reflection boundary. We contribute to the literature with a customized relaxed formulation and some new compactification arguments to establish the existence of a Markovian mean field equilibrium (MFE) in the weak sense. We consider an enlarged canonical space, utilizing the dynamic Skorokhod mapping, to accommodate the stochastic reflection boundary process. A fixed-point argument on the extended space using an extension transformation technique is developed to tackle challenges from the joint measure flow of the state and the relaxed control that may not be continuous. Furthermore, the bidirectional connections between the MFG and the $N$-player game are established in the context of joint law dependence and state reflections. We first show that any weak limit of empirical measures induced by $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in $N$-player games must be supported exclusively on the set of relaxed mean field equilibria, analogous to the propagation of chaos in mean field control problems. We then prove the convergence result that a Markovian MFE in the weak sense can be approximated by a sequence of constructed $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in the weak sense in $N$-player games when $N$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control For Anti-Abeta Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease using a Reaction-Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that severely impairs survival and quality of life. While anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) therapies can slow disease progression, their efficacy depends on personalized dosing that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks such as amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Mathematical modeling offers a powerful tool for understanding AD dynamics and optimizing treatment, yet most models focus solely on temporal behavior, overlooking spatial heterogeneity within the brain. In this study, we propose a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion model to describe Abeta plaque dynamics. We formulate an optimal control problem to minimize plaque concentration while balancing therapeutic efficacy and treatment risk. Under reasonable assumptions, we establish well-posedness and uniqueness of the optimal solution. A Finite Element Method (FEM) based numerical framework is developed to compute personalized treatment strategies. Our model is calibrated using longitudinal Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling estimation of patient-specific parameters such as growth rate and effective diffusivity. Results show that optimized treatment strategies consistently outperform constant dosing regimens across patient groups, achieving substantial reductions in cumulative amyloid burden while minimizing side effects. This integrated, data-driven framework advances personalized, spatially informed therapeutic optimization for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>A Bi-Objective Markov Decision Process Design approach to redundancy allocation with dynamic maintenance for a parallel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliability of a system can be improved by the addition of redundant elements, giving rise to the well-known redundancy allocation problem (RAP). We propose a novel extension to the RAP called the Bi-Objective Integrated Design and Dynamic Maintenance Problem (BO-IDDMP) which allows for future dynamic maintenance decisions to be incorporated. This leads to a problem with first-stage redundancy design decisions and second-stage sequential maintenance decisions under uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a continuous-time Markov Decision Process Design framework to formulate a problem with non-trivial dynamics, as well as its first use alongside bi-objective optimization. A general heuristic optimization methodology for bi-objective MDP Design problems is developed, and then applied to the BO-IDDMP. The efficiency and accuracy of our methodology are demonstrated against an exact mixed-integer linear programming solver. The heuristic is shown to be orders of magnitude faster in the majority of cases, and in only 2 out of 84 cases produces a solution that is dominated by the exact method. The inclusion of dynamic maintenance policies is shown to yield stronger and better-populated Pareto fronts, allowing more flexibility for the decision-maker. The impacts of varying parameters unique to our problem are also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOSs) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOSs, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOSs are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary matrix coefficient assignment for block matrix linear control systems by static output feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work has introduced a generalized formulation of the problem of eigenvalue spectrum assignment for block matrix systems. In this problem, it is required to construct a feedback that provides that the matrix of the closed-loop system is similar to a block companion matrix with arbitrary predetermined block matrix coefficients. Sufficient conditions for the resolvability of this problem by linear static output feedback are obtained when the coefficients of the system have a special form, namely, the state matrix is a lower block Frobenius matrix or a lower block Hessenberg matrix, and the input and output block matrix coefficients contain some zero blocks. These conditions are controllability-like rank conditions. Sufficient conditions are constructive. It is proved that, in particular cases, when the system has block scalar matrix coefficients, these conditions can be weakened. The results generalize the previous results obtained for the case of one-dimensional blocks and for the case of systems given by a linear differential equation of higher orders with a multidimensional state. Based on the main results, algorithms are developed that ensure the construction of a gain matrix. The algorithms are implemented on a modeling examples.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Momentum Tracking with Local Updates: Achieving Optimal Communication and Iteration Complexities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Local Momentum Tracking (LMT), a novel distributed stochastic gradient method for solving distributed optimization problems over networks. To reduce communication overhead, LMT enables each agent to perform multiple local updates between consecutive communication rounds. Specifically, LMT integrates local updates with the momentum tracking strategy and the Loopless Chebyshev Acceleration (LCA) technique. We demonstrate that LMT achieves linear speedup with respect to the number of local updates as well as the number of agents for minimizing smooth objective functions with and without the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. Notably, with sufficiently many local updates $Q\geq Q^*$, LMT attains the optimal communication complexity. For a moderate number of local updates $Q\in[1,Q^*]$, LMT achieves the optimal iteration complexity. To our knowledge, LMT is the first distributed stochastic gradient method with local updates that enjoys such properties.</description>

      <title>Adaptive directional decomposition methods for nonconvex constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonconvex constrained optimization problems with both equality and inequality constraints, covering deterministic and stochastic settings. We propose a novel first-order algorithm framework that employs a decomposition strategy to balance objective reduction and constraint satisfaction, together with adaptive update of stepsizes and merit parameters. Under certain conditions, the proposed adaptive directional decomposition methods attain an iteration complexity of order \(O(\epsilon^{-2})\) for finding an \(\epsilon\)-KKT point in the deterministic setting. In the stochastic setting, we further develop stochastic variants of approaches and analyze their theoretical properties by leveraging the perturbation theory. We establish the high-probability oracle complexity to find an $\epsilon$-KKT point of order \( \tilde O(\epsilon^{-4}, \epsilon^{-6}) \) (resp. \(\tilde O(\epsilon^{-3}, \epsilon^{-5}) \)) for gradient and constraint evaluations, in the absence (resp. presence) of sample-wise smoothness. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained complexity bounds are comparable to, or improve upon, the state-of-the-art results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dual representations for quasiconvex compositions with applications to systemic risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of finding dual representations for quasiconvex systemic risk measures in financial mathematics, we study quasiconvex compositions in an abstract infinite-dimensional setting. We calculate an explicit formula for the penalty function of the composition in terms of the penalty functions of the ingredient functions. The proof makes use of a nonstandard minimax inequality (rather than equality as in the standard case) that is available in the literature. In the second part of the paper, we apply our results in concrete probabilistic settings for systemic risk measures, in particular, in the context of Eisenberg-Noe clearing model. We also provide novel economic interpretations of the dual representations in these settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the null controllability of nonlinear wave systems. Initially, we employ a combination of the Galerkin method and a fixed point theorem to establish the null controllability for semi-linear wave equations with nonlinear functions that are dependent on velocities, under the geometric control condition. Subsequently, utilizing a novel iterative method, we demonstrate the null controllability for a class of quasi-linear wave systems in a constructive manner. Lastly, we present a control result for a class of fully nonlinear wave systems, serving as an application.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Training Dynamics of Private Fine-tuning with Langevin diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that differentially private full fine-tuning (DP-FFT) can distort pre-trained backbone features based on both theoretical and empirical results. We identify the cause of the distortion as the misalignment between the pre-trained backbone and the randomly initialized linear head. We prove that a sequential fine-tuning strategy can mitigate the feature distortion: first-linear-probing-then-fine-tuning (DP-LP-FFT). A new approximation scheme allows us to derive approximate upper and lower bounds on the training loss of DP-LP and DP-FFT, in a simple but canonical setting of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation. Experiments on real-world datasets and architectures are consistent with our theoretical insights. We also derive new upper bounds for 2-layer linear networks without the approximation. Moreover, our theory suggests a trade-off of privacy budget allocation in multi-phase fine-tuning methods like DP-LP-FFT.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA).
  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer Federated Learning: Reaching Equilibrium with Less Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches assume collaborative clients with aligned objectives working towards a shared global model. However, in many real-world scenarios, clients act as rational players with individual objectives and strategic behaviors, a concept that existing FL frameworks are not equipped to adequately address. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multiplayer Federated Learning (MpFL), a novel framework that models the clients in the FL environment as players in a game-theoretic context, aiming to reach an equilibrium. In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their own utility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, we propose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithm in which each player/client performs local updates independently and periodically communicates with other players. We theoretically analyze PEARL-SGD and prove that it reaches a neighborhood of equilibrium with less communication in the stochastic setup compared to its non-local counterpart. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bilevel Optimization: Efficient Algorithms with Near-Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is convex, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess empirical risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM, up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. We also provide population loss bounds for bilevel stochastic optimization. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the non-convex setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Graph Geometry via Fixed-Point Schr\"odinger-Type Activation: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for neural architectures whose internal representations evolve as stationary states of dissipative Schr\"odinger-type dynamics on learned latent graphs. Each layer is defined by a fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type equation depending on a weighted Laplacian encoding latent geometry and a convex local potential. We prove existence, uniqueness, and smooth dependence of equilibria, and show that the dynamics are equivalent under the Bloch map to norm-preserving Landau--Lifshitz flows. Training over graph weights and topology is formulated as stochastic optimization on a stratified moduli space of graphs equipped with a natural K\"{a}hler--Hessian metric, ensuring convergence and differentiability across strata. We derive generalization bounds -- PAC-Bayes, stability, and Rademacher complexity -- in terms of geometric quantities such as edge count, maximal degree, and Gromov--Hausdorff distortion, establishing that sparsity and geometric regularity control capacity. Feed-forward composition of stationary layers is proven equivalent to a single global stationary diffusion on a supra-graph; backpropagation is its adjoint stationary system. Finally, directed and vector-valued extensions are represented as sheaf Laplacians with unitary connections, unifying scalar graph, directed, and sheaf-based architectures. The resulting model class provides a compact, geometrically interpretable, and analytically tractable foundation for learning latent graph geometry via fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type activations.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When does a variational quantum algorithm converge to a globally optimal solution? Despite the large literature around variational approaches to quantum computing, the answer is largely unknown. We address this open question by developing a convergence theory for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). By leveraging the terminology of quantum control landscapes, we prove a sufficient criterion that characterizes when convergence to a ground state of a Hamiltonian can be guaranteed for almost all initial parameter settings. More specifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows for moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded manner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates, then the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop constructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two commonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\"atze. Finally, we discuss regularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as for condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem.</description>

      <title>Learning from Delayed Feedback in Games via Extra Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of social regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our WOFTRL recovers the good performances that social regret is constant in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies last-iterate converge to the Nash equilibrium in poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and strengthened by our experiments.</description>
