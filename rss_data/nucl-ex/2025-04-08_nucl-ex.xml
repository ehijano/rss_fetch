      <title>Astromeric nature of $^{119m}$Ag unveiled through direct mass measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03944v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of elements heavier than iron produced via the astrophysical rapid-neutron capture process depends sensitively on the atomic mass of the involved nuclei as well as the behavior of a few special types of nuclear isomers called astromers. High-precision mass measurements of $^{119}$Cd, $^{119}$Ag and their respective isomeric states have been performed with the Phase Imaging-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (PI-ICR) method with a precision of $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ using the Canadian Penning Trap (CPT). The ground state mass excess, as well as the excitation energy, agrees with recent Penning Trap measurements from JYFLTRAP. Network calculations using these new measurements revealed that, contrary to previous expectations, $^{119m}$Ag behaves as an astromer which significantly affects the population of $^{119}$Ag.</description>

      <title>Long-range transverse momentum correlations and radial flow in Pb$-$Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter presents measurements of long-range transverse-momentum correlations using a new observable, $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$, which serves as a probe of radial flow and medium properties in heavy-ion collisions. Results are reported for inclusive charged particles, pions, kaons, and protons across various centrality intervals in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, recorded by the ALICE detector. A pseudorapidity-gap technique, similar to that used in anisotropic-flow studies, is employed to suppress short-range correlations. At low $p_\mathrm{T}$, a characteristic mass ordering consistent with hydrodynamic collective flow is observed. At higher $p_\mathrm{T}$ ($&gt; 3$ GeV/$c$), protons exhibit larger $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$ than pions and kaons, in agreement with expectations from quark-recombination models. These results are sensitive to the bulk viscosity and the equation of state of the QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of substructure-dependent suppression of large-radius jets with charged particles in Pb+Pb collisions with ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure in Pb+Pb collisions provide key insights into the mechanism of jet quenching in the hot and dense QCD medium created in these collisions. This Letter presents a measurement of the suppression of large-radius jets with a radius parameter of $R = 1.0$ and its dependence on the jet substructure. The measurement uses 1.72 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb data and 255 pb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ data, both at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Large-radius jets are reconstructed by reclustering $R = 0.2$ calorimetric jets and are measured for transverse momentum above $200$ GeV. Jet substructure is evaluated using charged-particle tracks, and the overall level of jet suppression is quantified using the jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$). The jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is measured as a function of jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, the charged $k_t$ splitting scale ($\sqrt{d_{12}}$), and the angular separation ($dR_{12}$) of two leading sub-jets. The jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ gradually decreases with increasing $\sqrt{d_{12}}$, implying significantly stronger suppression of large-radius jets with larger $k_t$ splitting scale. The jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ gradually decreases for $dR_{12}$ in the range $0.01{-}0.2$ and then remains consistent with a constant for $dR_{12} \gtrsim 0.2$. The observed significant dependence of jet suppression on the jet substructure will provide new insights into its role in the quenching process.</description>

      <title>Observation of coherent $\phi$(1020) meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first observation of coherent $\phi$(1020) meson photoproduction off heavy nuclei is presented using ultraperipheral lead-lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV. The data were collected by the CMS experiment and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.68 $\mu$b$^{-1}$. The $\phi$(1020) meson signals are reconstructed via the K$^+$K$^-$ decay channel. The production cross section is presented as a function of the $\phi$(1020) meson rapidity in the range 0.3 $\lt$ $\lvert y\rvert$ $\lt$ 1.0, probing gluons that carry a fraction of the nucleon momentum ($x$) around $10^{-4}$. The observed cross section exhibits little dependence on rapidity and is significantly suppressed, by a factor of ${\sim}$5, compared to a baseline model that treats a nucleus as a collection of free nucleons. Theoretical models that incorporate either nuclear shadowing or gluon saturation predict suppression of the $\phi$(1020) meson cross section with only a small dependence on rapidity, but the magnitude of the predicted suppression varies greatly. Models considering only nuclear shadowing effects result in the best agreement with the experimental data. This study establishes a powerful new tool for exploring nuclear effects and nuclear gluonic structure in the small-$x$ regime at a unique energy scale bridging the perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics domains.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector heavy tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a unique probe to nuclear cluster structure $-$ a long-standing challenge in nuclear structure physics. Through the microscopic Brink model, we establish a quantitative framework to decode complicated cluster structures encoded in the cluster wave function, revealing non-negligible cluster components stemming from the rich structural degrees of freedom for the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. By combining this approach with advanced analytical calculation techniques, we demonstrate that the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC(3, 2) and Pearson coefficient $\rho (\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\ \delta d_{\perp})$ serve as robust discriminators between $5\alpha$ and $\alpha$+$^{16}$O cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne. Our findings suggest that ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally isolate $\alpha$-clustering configurations via flow correlations, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the baryon time-like electromagnetic form factors in the electron-positron annihilation reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the experimental measurements of the electron-positron annihilation reactions into a baryon ($B$) and anti-baryon ($\bar{B}$) pair, the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons in the time-like region can be investigated within the vector meson dominance model. The theoretical model parameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the process $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental data on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be well reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also estimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like baryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously proposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form factor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in the line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for the charmed baryon $\Lambda^+_c$. These features can be naturally explained by incorporating contributions from excited vector states. More precise measurements of the $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$ reaction offer a valuable opportunity to probe the properties of excited vector states, which are at present poorly known. Additionally, comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of baryon timelike electromagnetic form factors can provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms of electron-positron annihilation processes.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluation of the deuteron-deuteron thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic deuterium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deuteron-deuteron (D-D) thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic environments (considering the electron screening effects) is re-evaluated using the S-factor functions which
  were obtained by fitting to low-energy data on D-D reactions.
  For this purpose, a fitted S-factor model based on the NACRE compilation is employed.
  This limited the energy range of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) for
  the $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.
  The corresponding Maxwellian-averaged thermonuclear reaction
  rates of relevance in astrophysical plasmas at temperatures in the
  range from $10^{6}$ K to $10^{10}\left(\textrm{or }1.3\times10^{8}\right)$ K are provided in tabular formats.
  In these evaluations,
  the screening energy is assumed to be $100, 400, 750, 1000$ eV and $1250$ eV.
  This series of values has been selected based on theoretical and experimental studies conducted so far.</description>

      <title>Finite density signatures of confining and chiral dynamics in QCD thermodynamics and fluctuations of conserved charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate thermodynamic observables such as pressure, baryon number, entropy and energy density, as well as the second and fourth order baryon number cumulants in the phase structure of QCD. The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in quantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing and small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned observables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density.</description>

      <title>Influence of incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir at $E_{lab}$ = 64-84 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation functions of several evaporation residues populated via complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir system have been measured at energies $\approx$ 64-84 MeV, and analyzed in the framework of theoretical model code PACE4. It has been found that the $xn$ channels are predominantly populated via complete fusion; however, some of the $pxn$ channels decay via their precursor. A significant enhancement has been observed in the case of $\alpha$-emitting channels over PACE4 calculations, indicating the onset of a reaction mechanism not included in this code, e.g., incomplete fusion. For better insights into the onset and influence of incomplete fusion, the percentage fraction of incomplete fusion has been deduced and analyzed in terms of different entrance-channel parameters. The findings of the present study underline the importance of projectile energy, entrance-channel mass-asymmetry, and the Coulomb factor of interacting partners. The impact of projectile break-up on complete fusion has also been discussed in the framework of the Universal Fusion Function, where suppression of $\approx$ 12$\%$ has been observed in the fusion function. The finding of the present work reinstates that the fusion suppression is affected by the projectile $\alpha$-break-up threshold.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Coherent Neutrino Nucleus Elastic Scattering Cross Section at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino nucleus elastic scattering ({\nu}Ael) with reactor neutrinos is an interaction under full quantum-mechanical coherence. It has not yet been experimentally observed. We present new results on the studies of {\nu}Ael cross section with an electro-cooled p-type point-contact germanium detector at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino laboratory. A total of (242)357 kg-days of Reactor ON(OFF) data at a detector threshold of 200 eVee in electron equivalent unit are analyzed. The Lindhard model parametrized by a single variable k which characterizes the quenching function was used. Limits at 90% confidence level are derived on the ratio {\rho} relative to standard model (SM) cross section of {\rho}&lt;4.7 at the predicted value of k=0.162, while k&lt;0.285 at the SM-value of {\rho}=1. Prospects on future positive measurements are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP), leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>
