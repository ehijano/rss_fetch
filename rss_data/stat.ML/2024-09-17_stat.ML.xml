      <title>Bounds on the Generalization Error in Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish empirical risk minimization principles for active learning by deriving a family of upper bounds on the generalization error. Aligning with empirical observations, the bounds suggest that superior query algorithms can be obtained by combining both informativeness and representativeness query strategies, where the latter is assessed using integral probability metrics. To facilitate the use of these bounds in application, we systematically link diverse active learning scenarios, characterized by their loss functions and hypothesis classes to their corresponding upper bounds. Our results show that regularization techniques used to constraint the complexity of various hypothesis classes are sufficient conditions to ensure the validity of the bounds. The present work enables principled construction and empirical quality-evaluation of query algorithms in active learning.</description>

      <title>Topological Tensor Eigenvalue Theorems in Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for tensor eigenvalue analysis in the context of multi-modal data fusion, leveraging topological invariants such as Betti numbers. While traditional approaches to tensor eigenvalues rely on algebraic extensions of matrix theory, this work provides a topological perspective that enriches the understanding of tensor structures. By establishing new theorems linking eigenvalues to topological features, the proposed framework offers deeper insights into the latent structure of data, enhancing both interpretability and robustness. Applications to data fusion illustrate the theoretical and practical significance of the approach, demonstrating its potential for broad impact across machine learning and data science domains.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Representations with Hypergraph Wavelets: Applications to Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many data-driven applications, higher-order relationships among multiple objects are essential in capturing complex interactions. Hypergraphs, which generalize graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of nodes, provide a flexible and powerful framework for modeling such higher-order relationships. In this work, we introduce hypergraph diffusion wavelets and describe their favorable spectral and spatial properties. We demonstrate their utility for biomedical discovery in spatially resolved transcriptomics by applying the method to represent disease-relevant cellular niches for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Conditional sampling within generative diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusions are a powerful class of Monte Carlo samplers that leverage bridging Markov processes to approximate complex, high-dimensional distributions, such as those found in image processing and language models. Despite their success in these domains, an important open challenge remains: extending these techniques to sample from conditional distributions, as required in, for example, Bayesian inverse problems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing computational approaches to conditional sampling within generative diffusion models. Specifically, we highlight key methodologies that either utilise the joint distribution, or rely on (pre-trained) marginal distributions with explicit likelihoods, to construct conditional generative samplers.</description>

      <title>Learning large softmax mixtures with warm start EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed multinomial logits are discrete mixtures introduced several decades ago to model the probability of choosing an attribute from $p$ possible candidates, in heterogeneous populations. The model has recently attracted attention in the AI literature, under the name softmax mixtures, where it is routinely used in the final layer of a neural network to map a large number $p$ of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^L$ to a probability vector. Despite its wide applicability and empirical success, statistically optimal estimators of the mixture parameters, obtained via algorithms whose running time scales polynomially in $L$, are not known. This paper provides a solution to this problem for contemporary applications, such as large language models, in which the mixture has a large number $p$ of support points, and the size $N$ of the sample observed from the mixture is also large. Our proposed estimator combines two classical estimators, obtained respectively via a method of moments (MoM) and the expectation-minimization (EM) algorithm. Although both estimator types have been studied, from a theoretical perspective, for Gaussian mixtures, no similar results exist for softmax mixtures for either procedure. We develop a new MoM parameter estimator based on latent moment estimation that is tailored to our model, and provide the first theoretical analysis for a MoM-based procedure in softmax mixtures. Although consistent, MoM for softmax mixtures can exhibit poor numerical performance, as observed other mixture models. Nevertheless, as MoM is provably in a neighborhood of the target, it can be used as warm start for any iterative algorithm. We study in detail the EM algorithm, and provide its first theoretical analysis for softmax mixtures. Our final proposal for parameter estimation is the EM algorithm with a MoM warm start.</description>

      <title>Learning Capacity: A Measure of the Effective Dimensionality of a Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit a formal correspondence between thermodynamics and inference, where the number of samples can be thought of as the inverse temperature, to define a "learning capacity'' which is a measure of the effective dimensionality of a model. We show that the learning capacity is a tiny fraction of the number of parameters for many deep networks trained on typical datasets, depends upon the number of samples used for training, and is numerically consistent with notions of capacity obtained from the PAC-Bayesian framework. The test error as a function of the learning capacity does not exhibit double descent. We show that the learning capacity of a model saturates at very small and very large sample sizes; this provides guidelines, as to whether one should procure more data or whether one should search for new architectures, to improve performance. We show how the learning capacity can be used to understand the effective dimensionality, even for non-parametric models such as random forests and $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers.</description>

      <title>CHARM: Creating Halos with Auto-Regressive Multi-stage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize the amount of information extracted from cosmological datasets, simulations that accurately represent these observations are necessary. However, traditional simulations that evolve particles under gravity by estimating particle-particle interactions (N-body simulations) are computationally expensive and prohibitive to scale to the large volumes and resolutions necessary for the upcoming datasets. Moreover, modeling the distribution of galaxies typically involves identifying virialized dark matter halos, which is also a time- and memory-consuming process for large N-body simulations, further exacerbating the computational cost. In this study, we introduce CHARM, a novel method for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial, mass, and velocity statistics of halos directly from the large-scale distribution of the dark matter density field. We develop multi-stage neural spline flow-based networks to learn this mapping at redshift z=0.5 directly with computationally cheaper low-resolution particle mesh simulations instead of relying on the high-resolution N-body simulations. We show that the mock halo catalogs and painted galaxy catalogs have the same statistical properties as obtained from $N$-body simulations in both real space and redshift space. Finally, we use these mock catalogs for cosmological inference using redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, bispectrum, and wavelet-based statistics using simulation-based inference, performing the first inference with accelerated forward model simulations and finding unbiased cosmological constraints with well-calibrated posteriors. The code was developed as part of the Simons Collaboration on Learning the Universe and is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/CHARM}.</description>

      <title>Batched Online Contextual Sparse Bandits with Sequential Inclusion of Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed Bandits (MABs) are increasingly employed in online platforms and e-commerce to optimize decision making for personalized user experiences. In this work, we focus on the Contextual Bandit problem with linear rewards, under conditions of sparsity and batched data. We address the challenge of fairness by excluding irrelevant features from decision-making processes using a novel algorithm, Online Batched Sequential Inclusion (OBSI), which sequentially includes features as confidence in their impact on the reward increases. Our experiments on synthetic data show the superior performance of OBSI compared to other algorithms in terms of regret, relevance of features used, and compute.</description>

      <title>Active Learning to Guide Labeling Efforts for Question Difficulty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in research on Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Transformer-based neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance, primarily through supervised methods but with an isolated study in unsupervised learning. While supervised methods focus on predictive performance, they require abundant labeled data. On the other hand, unsupervised methods do not require labeled data but rely on a different evaluation metric that is also computationally expensive in practice. This work bridges the research gap by exploring active learning for QDE, a supervised human-in-the-loop approach striving to minimize the labeling efforts while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models. The active learning process iteratively trains on a labeled subset, acquiring labels from human experts only for the most informative unlabeled data points. Furthermore, we propose a novel acquisition function PowerVariance to add the most informative samples to the labeled set, a regression extension to the PowerBALD function popular in classification. We employ DistilBERT for QDE and identify informative samples by applying Monte Carlo dropout to capture epistemic uncertainty in unlabeled samples. The experiments demonstrate that active learning with PowerVariance acquisition achieves a performance close to fully supervised models after labeling only 10% of the training data. The proposed methodology promotes the responsible use of educational resources, makes QDE tools more accessible to course instructors, and is promising for other applications such as personalized support systems and question-answering tools.</description>

      <title>Consistent Spectral Clustering in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering, as an unsupervised technique, plays a pivotal role in various data analysis applications. Among clustering algorithms, Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces has been extensively studied. However, with the rapid evolution of data complexity, Euclidean Space is proving to be inefficient for representing and learning algorithms. Although Deep Neural Networks on hyperbolic spaces have gained recent traction, clustering algorithms or non-deep machine learning models on non-Euclidean Spaces remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces to address this gap. Hyperbolic Spaces offer advantages in representing complex data structures like hierarchical and tree-like structures, which cannot be embedded efficiently in Euclidean Spaces. Our proposed algorithm replaces the Euclidean Similarity Matrix with an appropriate Hyperbolic Similarity Matrix, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to clustering in Euclidean Spaces. Our contributions include the development of the spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces and the proof of its weak consistency. We show that our algorithm converges at least as fast as Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we present experimental results on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, highlighting the superior performance of Hyperbolic Spectral Clustering over its Euclidean counterpart. This work opens up avenues for utilizing non-Euclidean Spaces in clustering algorithms, offering new perspectives for handling complex data structures and improving clustering efficiency.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Flow for Unpaired Data Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and Schr\"odinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schr\"odinger Bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a flow of path measures, which we call the Schr\"odinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schr\"odinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Beta-Sigma VAE: Separating beta and decoder variance in Gaussian variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational autoencoder (VAE) is an established generative model but is notorious for its blurriness. In this work, we investigate the blurry output problem of VAE and resolve it, exploiting the variance of Gaussian decoder and $\beta$ of beta-VAE. Specifically, we reveal that the indistinguishability of decoder variance and $\beta$ hinders appropriate analysis of the model by random likelihood value, and limits performance improvement by omitting the gain from $\beta$. To address the problem, we propose Beta-Sigma VAE (BS-VAE) that explicitly separates $\beta$ and decoder variance $\sigma^2_x$ in the model. Our method demonstrates not only superior performance in natural image synthesis but also controllable parameters and predictable analysis compared to conventional VAE. In our experimental evaluation, we employ the analysis of rate-distortion curve and proxy metrics on computer vision datasets. The code is available on https://github.com/overnap/BS-VAE</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"{o}dinger bridge establishes a dynamic transport map between two target distributions via a reference process, simultaneously solving an associated entropic optimal transport problem. We consider the setting where samples from the target distributions are available, and the reference diffusion process admits tractable dynamics. We thus introduce Coupled Bridge Matching (BM$^2$), a simple \emph{non-iterative} approach for learning Schr\"{o}dinger bridges with neural networks. A preliminary theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of BM$^2$ is carried out, supported by numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Distributed Clustering based on Distributional Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for clustering in a distributed network called Distributed Clustering based on Distributional Kernel (K) or KDC that produces the final clusters based on the similarity with respect to the distributions of initial clusters, as measured by K. It is the only framework that satisfies all three of the following properties. First, KDC guarantees that the combined clustering outcome from all sites is equivalent to the clustering outcome of its centralized counterpart from the combined dataset from all sites. Second, the maximum runtime cost of any site in distributed mode is smaller than the runtime cost in centralized mode. Third, it is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed clustering framework that employs a distributional kernel. The distribution-based clustering leads directly to significantly better clustering outcomes than existing methods of distributed clustering. In addition, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Kernel Bounded Cluster Cores, which is the best clustering algorithm applied to KDC among existing clustering algorithms. We also show that KDC is a generic framework that enables a quadratic time clustering algorithm to deal with large datasets that would otherwise be impossible.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Viewpoint on Differential Privacy: Hypothesis Testing, Representation and Blackwell's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is widely considered the formal privacy for privacy-preserving data analysis due to its robust and rigorous guarantees, with increasingly broad adoption in public services, academia, and industry. Despite originating in the cryptographic context, in this review paper we argue that, fundamentally, differential privacy can be considered a \textit{pure} statistical concept. By leveraging a theorem due to David Blackwell, our focus is to demonstrate that the definition of differential privacy can be formally motivated from a hypothesis testing perspective, thereby showing that hypothesis testing is not merely convenient but also the right language for reasoning about differential privacy. This insight leads to the definition of $f$-differential privacy, which extends other differential privacy definitions through a representation theorem. We review techniques that render $f$-differential privacy a unified framework for analyzing privacy bounds in data analysis and machine learning. Applications of this differential privacy definition to private deep learning, private convex optimization, shuffled mechanisms, and U.S.~Census data are discussed to highlight the benefits of analyzing privacy bounds under this framework compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Understanding Simplicity Bias towards Compositional Mappings via Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining compositional mappings is important for the model to generalize well compositionally. To better understand when and how to encourage the model to learn such mappings, we study their uniqueness through different perspectives. Specifically, we first show that the compositional mappings are the simplest bijections through the lens of coding length (i.e., an upper bound of their Kolmogorov complexity). This property explains why models having such mappings can generalize well. We further show that the simplicity bias is usually an intrinsic property of neural network training via gradient descent. That partially explains why some models spontaneously generalize well when they are trained appropriately.</description>

      <title>Model Selection Through Model Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to select the best model of the data. Based on the exclusive properties of the nested models, we find the most parsimonious model containing the risk minimizer predictor. We prove the existence of probable approximately correct (PAC) bounds on the difference of the minimum empirical risk of two successive nested models, called successive empirical excess risk (SEER). Based on these bounds, we propose a model order selection method called nested empirical risk (NER). By the sorted NER (S-NER) method to sort the models intelligently, the minimum risk decreases. We construct a test that predicts whether expanding the model decreases the minimum risk or not. With a high probability, the NER and S-NER choose the true model order and the most parsimonious model containing the risk minimizer predictor, respectively. We use S-NER model selection in the linear regression and show that, the S-NER method without any prior information can outperform the accuracy of feature sorting algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that aided with prior knowledge of the true model order. Also, in the UCR data set, the NER method reduces the complexity of the classification of UCR datasets dramatically, with a negligible loss of accuracy.</description>

      <title>OML-AD: Online Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous and occur naturally in a variety of applications -- from data recorded by sensors in manufacturing processes, over financial data streams to climate data. Different tasks arise, such as regression, classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>RandALO: Out-of-sample risk estimation in no time flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating out-of-sample risk for models trained on large high-dimensional datasets is an expensive but essential part of the machine learning process, enabling practitioners to optimally tune hyperparameters. Cross-validation (CV) serves as the de facto standard for risk estimation but poorly trades off high bias ($K$-fold CV) for computational cost (leave-one-out CV). We propose a randomized approximate leave-one-out (RandALO) risk estimator that is not only a consistent estimator of risk in high dimensions but also less computationally expensive than $K$-fold CV. We support our claims with extensive simulations on synthetic and real data and provide a user-friendly Python package implementing RandALO available on PyPI as randalo and at https://github.com/cvxgrp/randalo.</description>

      <title>BEnDEM:A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Denoising Energy Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, ENERGY-BASED DENOISING ENERGY MATCHING, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to EnDEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate EnDEM and BEnDEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-welling potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BEnDEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</description>

      <title>Scaling Continuous Kernels with Sparse Fourier Domain Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address three key challenges in learning continuous kernel representations: computational efficiency, parameter efficiency, and spectral bias. Continuous kernels have shown significant potential, but their practical adoption is often limited by high computational and memory demands. Additionally, these methods are prone to spectral bias, which impedes their ability to capture high-frequency details. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages sparse learning in the Fourier domain. Our method enables the efficient scaling of continuous kernels, drastically reduces computational and memory requirements, and mitigates spectral bias by exploiting the Gibbs phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Theory for Semiparametric Data Fusion with Individual-Level Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the goal of conducting inference about a smooth finite-dimensional parameter by utilizing individual-level data from various independent sources. Recent advancements have led to the development of a comprehensive theory capable of handling scenarios where different data sources align with, possibly distinct subsets of, conditional distributions of a single factorization of the joint target distribution. While this theory proves effective in many significant contexts, it falls short in certain common data fusion problems, such as two-sample instrumental variable analysis, settings that integrate data from epidemiological studies with diverse designs (e.g., prospective cohorts and retrospective case-control studies), and studies with variables prone to measurement error that are supplemented by validation studies. In this paper, we extend the aforementioned comprehensive theory to allow for the fusion of individual-level data from sources aligned with conditional distributions that do not correspond to a single factorization of the target distribution. Assuming conditional and marginal distribution alignments, we provide universal results that characterize the class of all influence functions of regular asymptotically linear estimators and the efficient influence function of any pathwise differentiable parameter, irrespective of the number of data sources, the specific parameter of interest, or the statistical model for the target distribution. This theory paves the way for machine-learning debiased, semiparametric efficient estimation.</description>

      <title>On LASSO Inference for High Dimensional Predictive Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LASSO introduces shrinkage bias into estimated coefficients, which can adversely affect the desirable asymptotic normality and invalidate the standard inferential procedure based on the $t$-statistic. The desparsified LASSO has emerged as a well-known remedy for this issue. In the context of high dimensional predictive regression, the desparsified LASSO faces an additional challenge: the Stambaugh bias arising from nonstationary regressors. To restore the standard inferential procedure, we propose a novel estimator called IVX-desparsified LASSO (XDlasso). XDlasso eliminates the shrinkage bias and the Stambaugh bias simultaneously and does not require prior knowledge about the identities of nonstationary and stationary regressors. We establish the asymptotic properties of XDlasso for hypothesis testing, and our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Applying our method to real-world applications from the FRED-MD database -- which includes a rich set of control variables -- we investigate two important empirical questions: (i) the predictability of the U.S. stock returns based on the earnings-price ratio, and (ii) the predictability of the U.S. inflation using the unemployment rate.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Covariance Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling spatiotemporal interactions in multivariate time series is key to their effective processing, but challenging because of their irregular and often unknown structure. Statistical properties of the data provide useful biases to model interdependencies and are leveraged by correlation and covariance-based networks as well as by processing pipelines relying on principal component analysis (PCA). However, PCA and its temporal extensions suffer instabilities in the covariance eigenvectors when the corresponding eigenvalues are close to each other, making their application to dynamic and streaming data settings challenging. To address these issues, we exploit the analogy between PCA and graph convolutional filters to introduce the SpatioTemporal coVariance Neural Network (STVNN), a relational learning model that operates on the sample covariance matrix of the time series and leverages joint spatiotemporal convolutions to model the data. To account for the streaming and non-stationary setting, we consider an online update of the parameters and sample covariance matrix. We prove the STVNN is stable to the uncertainties introduced by these online estimations, thus improving over temporal PCA-based methods. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that STVNN is competitive for multivariate time series processing, it adapts to changes in the data distribution, and it is orders of magnitude more stable than online temporal PCA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Automated Data Quality Enhancement without Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, ensuring the quality of datasets has become increasingly crucial across various domains. We propose a comprehensive framework designed to automatically assess and rectify data quality issues in any given dataset, regardless of its specific content, focusing on both textual and numerical data. Our primary objective is to address three fundamental types of defects: absence, redundancy, and incoherence. At the heart of our approach lies a rigorous demand for both explainability and interpretability, ensuring that the rationale behind the identification and correction of data anomalies is transparent and understandable. To achieve this, we adopt a hybrid approach that integrates statistical methods with machine learning algorithms. Indeed, by leveraging statistical techniques alongside machine learning, we strike a balance between accuracy and explainability, enabling users to trust and comprehend the assessment process. Acknowledging the challenges associated with automating the data quality assessment process, particularly in terms of time efficiency and accuracy, we adopt a pragmatic strategy, employing resource-intensive algorithms only when necessary, while favoring simpler, more efficient solutions whenever possible. Through a practical analysis conducted on a publicly provided dataset, we illustrate the challenges that arise when trying to enhance data quality while keeping explainability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and rectifying missing values, duplicates and typographical errors as well as the challenges remaining to be addressed to achieve similar accuracy on statistical outliers and logic errors under the constraints set in our work.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Deconvolution with Profiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many experimental contexts, it is necessary to statistically remove the impact of instrumental effects in order to physically interpret measurements. This task has been extensively studied in particle physics, where the deconvolution task is called unfolding. A number of recent methods have shown how to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning. However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold (POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept highlighting its promising capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning, known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative, utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network edges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns about their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and experimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from medicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred. For example, in a three-class classification problem within additive manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of activation function selection in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Partial Distribution Matching via Partial Wasserstein Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution matching (DM), which is a fundamental machine learning problem seeking to robustly align two probability distributions. Our approach is established on a relaxed formulation, called partial distribution matching (PDM), which seeks to match a fraction of the distributions instead of matching them completely. We theoretically derive the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality for the partial Wasserstain-1 (PW) discrepancy, and develop a partial Wasserstein adversarial network (PWAN) that efficiently approximates the PW discrepancy based on this dual form. Partial matching can then be achieved by optimizing the network using gradient descent. Two practical tasks, point set registration and partial domain adaptation are investigated, where the goals are to partially match distributions in 3D space and high-dimensional feature space respectively. The experiment results confirm that the proposed PWAN effectively produces highly robust matching results, performing better or on par with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Universally Consistent K-Sample Tests via Dependence Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.08883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The K-sample testing problem involves determining whether K groups of data points are each drawn from the same distribution. Analysis of variance is arguably the most classical method to test mean differences, along with several recent methods to test distributional differences. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of a transformation that allows K-sample testing to be carried out using any dependence measure. Consequently, universally consistent K-sample testing can be achieved using a universally consistent dependence measure, such as distance correlation and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. This enables a wide range of dependence measures to be easily applied to K-sample testing.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Federated Learning in Federated Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has demonstrated great potential in revolutionizing distributed machine learning, and tremendous efforts have been made to extend it beyond the original focus on supervised learning. Among many directions, federated contextual bandits (FCB), a pivotal integration of FL and sequential decision-making, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, existing FCB approaches have largely employed their tailored FL components, often deviating from the canonical FL framework. Consequently, even renowned algorithms like FedAvg remain under-utilized in FCB, let alone other FL advancements. Motivated by this disconnection, this work takes one step towards building a tighter relationship between the canonical FL study and the investigations on FCB. In particular, a novel FCB design, termed FedIGW, is proposed to leverage a regression-based CB algorithm, i.e., inverse gap weighting. Compared with existing FCB approaches, the proposed FedIGW design can better harness the entire spectrum of FL innovations, which is concretely reflected as (1) flexible incorporation of (both existing and forthcoming) FL protocols; (2) modularized plug-in of FL analyses in performance guarantees; (3) seamless integration of FL appendages (such as personalization, robustness, and privacy). We substantiate these claims through rigorous theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simulation algorithm to simulate from a (multivariate) characteristic function, which is only accessible in a black-box format. The method is based on a generative neural network, whose loss function exploits a specific representation of the Maximum-Mean-Discrepancy metric to directly incorporate the targeted characteristic function. The algorithm is universal in the sense that it is independent of the dimension and that it does not require any assumptions on the given characteristic function. Furthermore, finite sample guarantees on the approximation quality in terms of the Maximum-Mean Discrepancy metric are derived. The method is illustrated in a simulation study.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Statistical Theory of Deep Learning: Approximation, Training Dynamics, and Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we review the literature on statistical theories of neural networks from three perspectives: approximation, training dynamics and generative models. In the first part, results on excess risks for neural networks are reviewed in the nonparametric framework of regression (and classification in Appendix~{\color{blue}B}). These results rely on explicit constructions of neural networks, leading to fast convergence rates of excess risks. Nonetheless, their underlying analysis only applies to the global minimizer in the highly non-convex landscape of deep neural networks. This motivates us to review the training dynamics of neural networks in the second part. Specifically, we review papers that attempt to answer ``how the neural network trained via gradient-based methods finds the solution that can generalize well on unseen data.'' In particular, two well-known paradigms are reviewed: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and Mean-Field (MF) paradigm. Last but not least, we review the most recent theoretical advancements in generative models including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and in-context learning (ICL) in the Large Language Models (LLMs) from two perpsectives reviewed previously, i.e., approximation and training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Half-VAE: An Encoder-Free VAE to Bypass Explicit Inverse Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference and inverse problems are closely related concepts, both fundamentally involving the deduction of unknown causes or parameters from observed data. Bayesian inference, a powerful class of methods, is often employed to solve a variety of problems, including those related to causal inference. Variational inference, a subset of Bayesian inference, is primarily used to efficiently approximate complex posterior distributions. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which combine variational inference with deep learning, have become widely applied across various domains. This study explores the potential of VAEs for solving inverse problems, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without relying on an explicit inverse mapping process. Unlike other VAE-based ICA methods, this approach discards the encoder in the VAE architecture, directly setting the latent variables as trainable parameters. In other words, the latent variables are no longer outputs of the encoder but are instead optimized directly through the objective function to converge to appropriate values. We find that, with a suitable prior setup, the latent variables, represented by trainable parameters, can exhibit mutually independent properties as the parameters converge, all without the need for an encoding process. This approach, referred to as the Half-VAE, bypasses the inverse mapping process by eliminating the encoder. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the Half-VAE to solve ICA without the need for an explicit inverse mapping process.</description>

      <title>Model-independent variable selection via the rule-based variable priority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics, and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification, and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show, among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection.</description>

      <title>Triadic Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TTERGM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM) are powerful statistical models that can be used to infer the temporal pattern of edge formation and elimination in complex networks (e.g., social networks). TERGMs can also be used in a generative capacity to predict longitudinal time series data in these evolving graphs. However, parameter estimation within this framework fails to capture many real-world properties of social networks, including: triadic relationships, small world characteristics, and social learning theories which could be used to constrain the probabilistic estimation of dyadic covariates. Here, we propose triadic temporal exponential random graph models (TTERGM) to fill this void, which includes these hierarchical network relationships within the graph model. We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Frank-Wolfe (FW) method is a popular approach for solving optimization problems with structured constraints that arise in machine learning applications. In recent years, stochastic versions of FW have gained popularity, motivated by large datasets for which the computation of the full gradient is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present two new variants of the FW algorithms for stochastic finite-sum minimization. Our algorithms have the best convergence guarantees of existing stochastic FW approaches for both convex and non-convex objective functions. Our methods do not have the issue of permanently collecting large batches, which is common to many stochastic projection-free approaches. Moreover, our second approach does not require either large batches or full deterministic gradients, which is a typical weakness of many techniques for finite-sum problems. The faster theoretical rates of our approaches are confirmed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary challenge facing modern scientific research is the limited availability of gold-standard data which can be costly, labor-intensive, or invasive to obtain. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML), scientists can now employ ML algorithms to predict gold-standard outcomes with variables that are easier to obtain. However, these predicted outcomes are often used directly in subsequent statistical analyses, ignoring imprecision and heterogeneity introduced by the prediction procedure. This will likely result in false positive findings and invalid scientific conclusions. In this work, we introduce PoSt-Prediction Adaptive inference (PSPA) that allows valid and powerful inference based on ML-predicted data. Its "assumption-lean" property guarantees reliable statistical inference without assumptions on the ML prediction. Its "data-adaptive" feature guarantees an efficiency gain over existing methods, regardless of the accuracy of ML prediction. We demonstrate the statistical superiority and broad applicability of our method through simulations and real-data applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high-dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG leverages a decoder to transform latent variables from a simple distribution into samples approximating the target Boltzmann distribution, while the diffusion-based encoder provides an accurate estimate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence during training. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of complex distribution tasks, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Conformal Off-Policy Prediction for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-Policy Prediction (OPP), i.e., predicting the outcomes of a target policy using only data collected under a nominal (behavioural) policy, is a paramount problem in data-driven analysis of safety-critical systems where the deployment of a new policy may be unsafe. To achieve dependable off-policy predictions, recent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal prediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees under the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the distribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to single-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards). In this work, we introduce MA-COPP, the first conformal prediction method to solve OPP problems involving multi-agent systems, deriving joint prediction regions for all agents' trajectories when one or more ego agents change their policies. Unlike the single-agent scenario, this setting introduces higher complexity as the distribution shifts affect predictions for all agents, not just the ego agents, and the prediction task involves full multi-dimensional trajectories, not just reward values. A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or exhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead required by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region. We achieve this by showing that an over-approximation of the true joint prediction region (JPR) can be constructed, without enumeration, from the maximum density ratio of the JPR trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of MA-COPP in multi-agent systems from the PettingZoo library and the F1TENTH autonomous racing environment, achieving nominal coverage in higher dimensions and various shift settings.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Language Models: Assessment through Rank-Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have shown promising performance in natural language generation. However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein F-tests for Fr\'echet regression on Bures-Wasserstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression analysis with random covariance matrix as outcome and Euclidean covariates in the framework of Fr\'echet regression on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. Such regression problems have many applications in single cell genomics and neuroscience, where we have covariance matrix measured over a large set of samples. Fr\'echet regression on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold is formulated as estimating the conditional Fr\'echet mean given covariates $x$. A non-asymptotic $\sqrt{n}$-rate of convergence (up to $\log n$ factors) is obtained for our estimator $\hat{Q}_n(x)$ uniformly for $\left\|x\right\| \lesssim \sqrt{\log n}$, which is crucial for deriving the asymptotic null distribution and power of our proposed statistical test for the null hypothesis of no association. In addition, a central limit theorem for the point estimate $\hat{Q}_n(x)$ is obtained, giving insights to a test for covariate effects. The null distribution of the test statistic is shown to converge to a weighted sum of independent chi-squares, which implies that the proposed test has the desired significance level asymptotically. Also, the power performance of the test is demonstrated against a sequence of contiguous alternatives. Simulation results show the accuracy of the asymptotic distributions. The proposed methods are applied to a single cell gene expression data set that shows the change of gene co-expression network as people age.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Systems Under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS) offer a versatile framework for constructing predictive distributions, allowing for calibrated inference and informative decision-making. However, their applicability has been limited to scenarios adhering to the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) model assumption. This paper extends CPS to accommodate scenarios characterized by covariate shifts. We therefore propose Weighted CPS (WCPS), akin to Weighted Conformal Prediction (WCP), leveraging likelihood ratios between training and testing covariate distributions. This extension enables the construction of nonparametric predictive distributions capable of handling covariate shifts. We present theoretical underpinnings and conjectures regarding the validity and efficacy of WCPS and demonstrate its utility through empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our simulation experiments indicate that WCPS are probabilistically calibrated under covariate shift.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning for Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical researchers and decision-makers spanning various domains frequently seek profound insights into the long-term impacts of interventions. While the significance of long-term outcomes is undeniable, an overemphasis on them may inadvertently overshadow short-term gains. Motivated by this, this paper formalizes a new framework for learning the optimal policy that effectively balances both long-term and short-term rewards, where some long-term outcomes are allowed to be missing. In particular, we first present the identifiability of both rewards under mild assumptions. Next, we deduce the semiparametric efficiency bounds, along with the consistency and asymptotic normality of their estimators. We also reveal that short-term outcomes, if associated, contribute to improving the estimator of the long-term reward. Based on the proposed estimators, we develop a principled policy learning approach and further derive the convergence rates of regret and estimation errors associated with the learned policy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Mallows-DPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the Mallows-DPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with Mallows-DPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Safety Alignment for Large Language Models via Optimal Dualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a dualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on aggregate expert error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis for Randomized Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically established algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO), where we assume the objective function $f$ follows GP. One notable drawback of GP-UCB is that the theoretical confidence parameter $\beta$ increased along with the iterations is too large. To alleviate this drawback, this paper analyzes the randomized variant of GP-UCB called improved randomized GP-UCB (IRGP-UCB), which uses the confidence parameter generated from the shifted exponential distribution. We analyze the expected regret and conditional expected regret, where the expectation and the probability are taken respectively with $f$ and noises and with the randomness of the BO algorithm. In both regret analyses, IRGP-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret upper bound without increasing the confidence parameter if the input domain is finite. Finally, we show numerical experiments using synthetic and benchmark functions and real-world emulators.</description>
