      <title>Computations of classical Mahowald invariants at prime 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the definition of Mahowald invariants and discuss the computational method of Mark Brehens introduced in [arXiv:math/0507182]. Then we examine the relationship between the algebraic Mahowald invariants and the \( E \)-filtered Mahowald invariants, and compute the Mahowald invariants for most elements up to the 26-stem.</description>

      <title>An Enriched Approach to the Strictification of $(\infty,1)$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a functor which takes in an $(\infty,1)$-category and outputs an $(\omega,1)$-category, the natural maximally "strict" version of an $(\infty,1)$-category. We do this by modeling $(\infty,1)$-categories as categories enriched in $\infty$-groupoids, and then "locally strictifying" (applying the strictification of $\infty$-groupoids to each hom space) to obtain a category enriched in $\omega$-groupoids with respect to the Gray tensor product, followed by "globally strictifying" (strictifying the enrichment from the Gray tensor product to the cartesian product) to obtain a category cartesian-enriched in $\omega$-groupoids, which is equivalently an $(\omega,1)$-category. We conjecture that this functor is conservative, and prove this for two dual special cases: $2$-truncated and $2$-connected $(\infty,1)$-categories. Along the way, we construct a sort of "incoherent walking $(\omega,1)$-equivalence," which gives a simpler description of the coherent path lifting condition for fibrations of $(\omega,1)$-categories, only involving cells of dimension $\le 3$.</description>

      <title>TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</description>

      <title>Theta-invariants of $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences to spherical 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Bott and Cattaneo's $\Theta$-invariant of 3-manifolds applied to $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences from 3-manifolds to a fixed spherical 3-manifold. The $\Theta$-invariants are defined by integrals over configuration spaces of two points with local systems and by choosing some invariant tensors. We compute upper bounds of the dimensions of the space spanned by the Bott--Cattaneo $\Theta$-invariants and of that spanned by Garoufalidis and Levine's finite type invariants of type 2. The computation is based on representation theory of finite groups.</description>

      <title>The LMO Spectrum: Factorization Homology and the E_3-Structure of the Jacobi Diagram Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the LMO spectrum, a categorification of the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant for 3-manifolds, using factorization homology. The theoretical foundation is our main algebraic result (Theorem A): the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, $\AJac$, possesses a homotopy $E_3$-algebra structure. This is a necessary condition for consistency within factorization homology, and the proof relies on the formality of the little 3-disks operad. A universal surgery formula is derived from the excision axiom (Theorem B), providing a computational basis independent of conjectural models. As an application (Theorem C), we construct an ``$H_1$-decorated LMO invariant'' that distinguishes the lens spaces $L(156, 5)$ and $L(156, 29)$, a pair that the classical LMO invariant fails to separate.</description>
