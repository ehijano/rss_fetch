      <title>Satellite Visibility During the April 2024 Total Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 8 April 2024, tens of millions of people across North America will be able to view a total solar eclipse. Such astronomical events have been important throughout history, but with nearly 10,000 satellites in orbit, we question whether total eclipses will now reveal a sky full of satellites, fundamentally changing this experience for humanity. Using the current population of Starlink satellites, we find that the brightest satellites would be naked-eye visible in dark skies, but the high sky brightness during totality will make them undetectable to the unaided eye. Our model does not take into account the effects of chance reflections from large, flat surfaces like solar panels, which we expect will cause glints and flares that could be visible from large satellites and abandoned rocket bodies. Time-lapse all-sky imaging might reveal satellites during the eclipse.</description>

      <title>Species Syzygy: Which Animal Has Seen the Most Total Solar Eclipses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Total Solar Eclipse (TSE) is a shocking and sublime experience. In just a week hundreds of millions of Homo Sapiens will attempt to see the 2024 eclipse as it stretches across the North American continent. However, while Homo Sapiens may be uniquely positioned to understand and predict eclipses, they are not the only species capable of observing them. The precise alignment of the Moon, Earth and Sun all existed well before humans. In the same way we share this planet capable of hosting life, the fantastic astronomical experiences available on it are not exclusive either. We present a framework to calculate the number of Total Solar Eclipses experienced by a species at any point in Earth's history. This includes factoring in the evolution of the Sun-Moon-Earth system, the duration the species is extant, and average population. We normalize over the geographic range by calculating an Astronomical World Eclipse Surface cOverage MEtric (AWESOME) time. To illustrate this framework we look at the case study of the family Limulidae (Horseshoe Crabs) and estimate the number of individuals that have seen an eclipse. We compare it to the number of current Homo Sapiens that view eclipses, and predict if it is possible for another species to take the ''top'' spot before the final total solar eclipse in ~ 380 million years.</description>

      <title>Combined spin orientation and phase function of asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large surveys provide numerous non-targeted observations of small bodies (SSOs). The upcoming LSST of the Rubin observatory will be the largest source of SSO photometry in the next decade. With non-coordinated epochs of observation, colors, and therefore taxonomy and composition, can only be computed by comparing absolute magnitudes obtained in each filter by solving the phase function (evolution of brightness of the small body against the solar phase angle). Current models in use in the community (HG, HG12* , HG1G2) however fail to reproduce the long-term photometry of many targets due to the change in aspect angle between apparitions.
  We aim at deriving a generic yet simple phase function model accounting for the variable geometry of the SSOs over multiple apparitions.
  We propose the sHG1G2 phase function model in which we introduce a term describing the brightness changes due to spin orientation and polar oblateness. We apply this new model to 13,245,908 observations of 122,675 SSOs. These observations were acquired in the g and r filters with the Zwicky Transient Facility. We retrieve them and implement the new sHG1G2 model in Fink, a broker of alerts designed for the LSST.
  The sHG1G2 model leads to smaller residuals than other phase function models, providing a better description of the photometry of asteroids. We determine the absolute magnitude H and phase function coefficients (G1, G2) in each filter, the spin orientation (RA_0,DEC_0), and the polar-to-equatorial oblateness R for 95,593 Solar System Objects (SSOs), which constitutes about a tenfold increase in the number of characterised objects compared to current census.
  The application of the sHG1G2 model on ZTF alert data using the FINK broker shows that the model is appropriate to extract physical properties of asteroids from multi-band and sparse photometry, such as the forthcoming LSST survey.</description>

      <title>The Public Photometry Pipelines for Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, exoplanet atmospheric characterization has became what some might call the cosmology of astronomy. In an attempt to extract and understand the weak planetary signals (a few percent down to a few tens of ppm times that of their host-star signals), researchers have developed dozens of idealized planetary atmospheric models. Physical interpretations hinge on pretending that we understand stellar signals (as well behaved mostly temporarily static spherical cows), as well as planetary signals (as unidimensional objects, or sometimes quasi-multidimensional objects). The discovery of small and cool planets has lead to analyze planetary signals well below the designed photometric precision of current instrumentation. The challenge is up there, and keep us busy, so all is well. Here we present yet another open-source tool to analyze exoplanet data of time-series observations. The {\puppies} code is available via PyPI (\texttt{pip install exo-puppies}) and conda, the documentation is located at https://puppies.rtfd.io</description>

      <title>In Violation of the Prime Directive: Simulating detriments to Delta-Quadrant civilizations from the starship Voyager's impact on planetary rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seven years that the starship Voyager spent in the Delta Quadrant, it used many questionable techniques to engage with alien civilizations and ultimately find its way home. From detailed studies of their logs and opening credits, we simulate Voyager's practice of orbiting a planet, to examine the effect on planetary rings. We outline a feasible planetary system and simulate the extent to which its rings would be disrupted. We find that Voyager's orbit could inflate the height of the rings in the vicinity of the spacecraft by a factor of 2, as well as increase the relative speeds of neighboring planetesimals within the rings. This increase in ring thickness has the potential to alter shadows on any moons of this planet, impacting ring-shadow based religions. Additionally, the acceleration of these planetesimals could rival their gravity, bucking any alien inhabitants and their tiny civilizations off of their planetesimal homeworlds. Finally, we posit that due to increased collisions amongst the planetesimals (which may harbor tiny intelligent life) the trajectory of these civilizations may be forever altered, violating the prime directive.</description>

      <title>Vulcan: Retreading a Tired Hypothesis with the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of planets in the solar system over the last three centuries has, perhaps surprisingly, been less of a fixed value than one would think it should be. In this paper, we look at the specific case of Vulcan, which was both a planet before Pluto was a planet and discarded from being a planet before Pluto was downgraded. We examine the historical context that led to its discovery in the 19th century, the decades of observations that were taken of it, and its eventual fall from glory. By applying a more modern understanding of astrophysics, we provide multiple mechanisms that may have changed the orbit of Vulcan sufficiently that it would have been outside the footprint of early 20th century searches for it. Finally, we discuss how the April 8, 2024 eclipse provides a renewed opportunity to rediscover this lost planet after more than a century of having been overlooked.</description>

      <title>A reanalysis of the LHS 1140 b atmosphere observed with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-Earth LHS 1140 b is an interesting target for atmospheric observations since it is close to the habitable zone of its star and falls in the gap of the radius distribution of small exoplanets, in the region thought to correspond to the transition between planets with and without atmospheres. Observations of the primary transit with WFC3 on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed a modulation in the planet transmission spectrum compatible with the presence of water; however this modulation may be also due to stellar activity-related phenomena. Here we present a detailed analysis of the WFC3/HST observations to probe the nature of this modulation and to understand if it can be attributable to the presence of unocculted spots on the stellar surface. Our analysis strongly suggests that LHS1140 is a rather quiet star with subsolar [Fe/H] and enriched in alpha elements. Therefore, we rule out the possibility that the planetary spectrum is affected by the presence of spots and faculae. This analysis shows the importance of a proper modelling of the stellar spectrum when analyzing transit observations. Finally, we modelled the planetary atmosphere of LHS1140 b to retrieve its atmospheric composition. However, the low resolution and the narrow spectral range of HST observations prevented us from definitively determining whether the spectral features are attributable to the presence of water or of other molecules in the planetary atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Debris Disk Host Star HD 21997 is a High-Frequency Delta Scuti Pulsator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD 21997 is host to a prototypical "hybrid" debris disk characterized by debris disk-like dust properties and a CO gas mass comparable to a protoplanetary disk. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite time series photometry to demonstrate that HD 21997 is a high-frequency delta Scuti pulsator. If the mode identification can be unambiguously determined in future works, an asteroseismic age of HD 21997 may become feasible.</description>

      <title>Predissociation dynamics of the hydroxyl radical (OH) based on a five-state spectroscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) potential energy curves (PECs) and spin-orbit couplings for the X $^2\Pi$, A $^2 \Sigma^+$, 1 $^2 \Sigma^-$, 1 $^4 \Sigma^-$, and 1 $^4 \Pi$ states of OH are computed and refined against empirical energy levels and transitions to produce a spectroscopic model. Predissociation lifetimes are determined by discretising continuum states in the variational method nuclear motion calculation by restricting the calculation to finite range of internuclear separations. Varying this range give a series of avoided crossings between quasi-bound states associated with the A $^2 \Sigma^+$ and continuum states, from which predissociation lifetimes are extracted. 424 quasi-bound A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state rovibronic energy levels are analysed and 374 predissociation lifetimes are produced, offering good coverage of the predissociation region. Agreement with measured lifetimes is satisfactory and a majority of computed results were within experimental uncertainty. A previously unreported A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state predissociation channel which goes via the X $^2\Pi$ is identified in the calculations. A python package, binslt, is produced to calculate predissociation lifetimes, associated line broadening parameters, and uncertainties from Duo *.states files is made available. The PECs and other curves from this work will be used to produce a rovibronic ExoMol linelist and temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections for the hydroxyl radical.</description>

      <title>Unobserving the Moon: the spurious possibility of orbital decoupling due to solar neutrino Arago spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's wave nature of matter makes diffraction theory applicable for particles, such as neutrinos, as well. During a solar eclipse, some of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun are diffracted by the Moon, resulting in a diffraction pattern that can be observed on Earth. In this paper we consider the theoretically emerging solar neutrino Arago spot as a means to measure the location of the Moon with high accuracy and consider its implication on the orbit of the Moon given Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Our results indicate that the Moon is not at immediate risk of orbital decoupling due to the observation of a solar neutrino Arago spot.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Dominant Formation Mechanism of Multi-Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most, if not all, sun-like stars host one or more planets, making multi-planetary systems commonplace in our galaxy. We utilize hundreds of multi-planet simulations to explore the origin of such systems, focusing on their orbital architecture. The first set of simulations assumes in-situ assembly of planetary embryos, while the second explores planetary migration. After applying observational biases to the simulations, we compare them to 250+ observed multi-planetary systems, including 13 systems with planets in the habitable zone. For all of the systems, we calculate two of the so-called statistical measures: the mass concentration ($S_{c}$) and orbital spacing ($S_{s}$). After analytic and empirical analyses, we find that the measures are related to first-order with a power law: $S_{c} \sim S_{s}^\beta$. The in-situ systems exhibit steeper power-law relations relative to the migration systems. We show that different formation scenarios cover different regions in the $S_{s} - S_{c}$ diagram with some overlap. Furthermore, we discover that observed systems with $S_{s} &lt; 30$ are likely dominated by the migration scenario, while those with $S_{s} \geq 30$ are likely dominated by the in-situ scenario. We apply these criteria to determine that a majority (62%) of observed multi-planetary systems formed via migration, whereas most systems with currently observed habitable planets formed via in-situ assembly. This work provides methods of leveraging the statistical measures ($S_{s}$ and $S_{c}$) to disentangle the formation history of observed multi-planetary systems based on their present-day architectures.</description>

      <title>TOI-1199 b and TOI-1273 b: Two new transiting hot Saturns detected and characterized with SOPHIE and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the characterization of two planet candidates detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), TOI-1199 b and TOI-1273 b, with periods of 3.7 and 4.6 days, respectively. Follow-up observations for both targets, which include several ground-based light curves, confirmed the transit events. High-precision radial velocities from the SOPHIE spectrograph revealed signals at the expected frequencies and phases of the transiting candidates and allowed mass determinations with a precision of $8.4\%$ and $6.7\%$ for TOI-1199 b and TOI-1273 b, respectively. The planetary and orbital parameters were derived from a joint analysis of the radial velocities and photometric data. We find that the planets have masses of $0.239\,\pm\,0.020\,M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and $0.222\,\pm\,0.015\,M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and radii of $0.938\,\pm\,0.025\,R_{\mathrm{J}}$ and $0.99\,\pm\,0.22\,R_{\mathrm{J}}$, respectively. The grazing transit of TOI-1273 b translates to a larger uncertainty in its radius, and hence also in its bulk density, compared to TOI-1199 b. The inferred bulk densities of $0.358\,\pm\,0.041\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $0.28\,\pm\,0.11\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ are among the lowest known for exoplanets in this mass range, which, considering the brightness of the host stars ($V \approx 11\,\mathrm{mag}$), render them particularly amenable to atmospheric characterization via the transit spectroscopy technique. The better constraints on the parameters of TOI-1199 b provide a transmission spectroscopy metric of $134\,\pm\,17$, making it the better suited of the two planets for atmospheric studies.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>

      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations have become one of the key tools used by theorists in all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code SWIFT. The software package exploits hybrid shared- and distributed-memory task-based parallelism, asynchronous communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. SWIFT also evolves neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code architecture, summarise the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed, and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run with SWIFT.</description>

      <title>Fossil and present-day stromatolite ooids contain a meteoritic polymer of glycine and iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hemoglycin, a space polymer of glycine and iron, has been identified in the carbonaceous chondritic meteorites Allende, Acfer 086, Kaba, Sutters Mill and Orgueil. Its core form has a mass of 1494Da and is basically an antiparallel pair of polyglycine strands linked at each end by an iron atom. The polymer forms two- and three- dimensional lattices with an inter-vertex distance of 4.9nm. Here the extraction technique for meteorites is applied to a 2.1Gya fossil stromatolite to reveal the presence of hemoglycin by mass spectrometry. Intact ooids from a recent (3,000Ya) stromatolite exhibited the same visible hemoglycin fluorescence in response to x-rays as an intact crystal from the Orgueil meteorite. X-ray analysis confirmed the existence in ooids of an internal 3-dimensional lattice of 4.9nm inter-vertex spacing, matching the spacing of lattices in meteoritic crystals. FTIR measurements of acid-treated ooid and a Sutters Mill meteoritic crystal both show the presence, via the splitting of the Amide I band, of an extended anti-parallel beta sheet structure. It seems probable that the copious in-fall of carbonaceous meteoritic material, from Archaean times onward, has left traces of hemoglycin in sedimentary carbonates and potentially has influenced ooid formation.</description>
