      <title>Some Peculiarities of Dielectric Spectroscopy in Ferroelectric Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric spectroscopy is known as one of the most powerful techniques for studying ferroelectric and other polar materials. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals, it has been successfully employed for the characterization of ferro-, antiferro- and ferri-electric liquid crystalline phases. However, recently the Boulder group raised the question of the applicability of dielectric spectroscopy for characterizing ferroelectric nematics due to parasitic effects from the insulating alignment layers. This affects the apparent/measured values of the dielectric permittivity. In this paper, we study this effect in greater detail. The following issues will receive special attention: Are the real values of dielectric permittivity lower or higher than the measured ones? Can the real values of dielectric permittivity be recovered in the cell with alignment layers? We also provide an example of the effect of insulating alignment layers in a non-ferroelectric nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory ToolKit (DFTTK) to Automate First-Principles Thermodynamics via the Quasiharmonic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helmholtz energy is a key thermodynamic quantity representing available energy to do work at a constant temperature and volume. Despite a well-established methodology from first-principles calculations, a comprehensive tool and database are still lacking. To address this gap, we developed an open-source Density Functional Theory Tool Kit (DFTTK), which automates first-principles thermodynamics using the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) for Helmholtz energy predictions. This Python-based package provides a solution for automating the calculation and analysis of various contributions to Helmholtz energy, including the static total energy contributions at 0 K in terms of DFT-based energy-volume curves, vibrational contributions from the Debye-Gruneisen model and phonons, and thermal electronic contributions via the electronic density of states. The QHA is also implemented to calculate the Gibbs energy and associated properties at constant temperature and pressure. The present work demonstrates DFTTK's capabilities through case studies on a simple FCC Al and various collinear magnetic configurations of Invar Fe3Pt, where DFTTK enumerates all unique configurations and their associated multiplicities. DFTTK is freely available on GitHub, and its modular design allows for the easy addition of new workflows.</description>

      <title>Effects of chemical disorder and spin-orbit coupling on electronic-structure and Fermi-surface topology of YbSb-based monopnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the influence of disorder on the electronic structure of YbSb -- a rare-earth monopnictide featuring a simple rock-salt (B1) crystal structure and a well-defined Fermi surface topology -- by employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT). We focus on chemical disorder introduced through Te and Al doping, selected based on their thermodynamic stability in alloyed configurations, to understand how such perturbations modify the electronic states of YbSb. Our results indicate that Te doping predominantly introduces electron-like states at the \textit{X} and \textit{L} points, while Al doping leads to a suppression of hole-like states at $\Gamma$, effectively driving the system from a semimetallic state to one characterized by very narrow-gap behavior at $\Gamma$. This modulation of the Fermi surface, particularly the reduction of central hole pockets at $\Gamma$, plays a central role in altering inter-pocket scattering -- a mechanism critical for tuning quantum transport properties, including superconductivity. This disorder-driven modulation of the Fermi surface, particularly the suppression of central hole pockets at $\Gamma$, controls inter-pocket scattering, which is essential for optimizing quantum transport properties, including superconductivity. Our results show that disorder can be effectively used as a means of engineering band topology, thereby tuning quantum-related responses through tailored electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Optical Analysis of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ultrathin Tm$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$/Pt Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic bilayers consisting of an epitaxially grown ferrimagnetic insulator and a heavy metal layer are attractive for spintronic application because of the opportunity for electric control and read-out of spin textures via spin orbit torque. Here, we investigate ultrathin thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/Pt bilayers when the TmIG layer thickness is 3 nm and below using a sensitive Sagnac magneto-optical Kerr effect technique. We compare the hysteresis loops from out-of-plane and in-plane applied magnetic fields. The preferred magnetization orientation evolves with the TmIG thickness and the presence of the Pt overlayer. We quantify the evolution of the magnetic anisotropy in these ultrathin films and find a significant change even when the TmIG thickness is varied by less than 1 nm. In these ultrathin films, the presence of a Pt overlayer changes the effective anisotropy field by more than a factor of 2, suggesting that the interfacial anisotropy at the Pt/TmIG interface plays a critical role in this regime.</description>

      <title>Lattice Dynamics of Energy Materials Investigated by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, I discuss several basic science studies in the field of energy materials using neutron scattering as a probe for the lattice dynamics. To enable understanding of neutron scattering spectra, I also use computational and theoretical methods. These methods and neutron scattering in general are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic quantum mechanics as well as with solid state physics topics including the band theory of electrons, harmonic lattice dynamics, and molecular dynamics. For the unfamiliar reader, the details of electronic structure theory and lattice dynamics that are needed to understand the methods in Chapter 2 are provided in Chapters 3 and 4. In the remaining chapters, these methods are applied to the study of several energy materials: cuprate La2CuO4,(hybrid) solar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and thermoelectric clathrate Ba8Ga16Ge30.</description>

      <title>Inference of phase field fracture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase field approach to modeling fracture uses a diffuse damage field to represent a crack. This addresses the singularities that arise at the crack tip in computations with sharp interface models, mollifying some of the difficulties associated with the mathematical and numerical treatment of fracture. The introduction of the diffuse field helps with crack propagation dynamics, enabling phase-field approaches to model all phases of damage from crack initiation to propagation, branching, and merging. Specific formulations, beginning with brittle fracture, have also been shown to converge to classical solutions. Extensions to cover the range of material failure, including ductile and cohesive fracture, leads to an array of possible models. There exists a large body of studies of these models and their consequences for crack evolution. However, there have not been systematic studies into how optimal models may be chosen. Here we take a first step in this direction by developing formal methods for identification of the best parsimonious model of phase field fracture given full-field data on the damage and deformation fields. We consider some of the main models that have been used to model damage, its degradation of elastic response, and its propagation. Our approach builds upon Variational System Identification (VSI), a weak form variant of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In this first communication we focus on synthetically generated data but we also consider central issues associated with the use of experimental full-field data, such as data sparsity and noise.</description>

      <title>Broad-temperature-range ultrafast terahertz excitation of collective dynamics in polar skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast coherent control of electric dipoles using strong terahertz (THz) pulses provides a means to discover hidden phases of materials and potentially leads to applications in high-speed electro-optic devices. The effectiveness of this means, albeit demonstrated in architype (incipient) ferroelectric systems such as SrTiO3, hinges on a spectral overlapping between their soft phonon modes within the excitation bandwidth of THz pulses. Generally this can only induce an appreciable coupling close to the phase transition temperatures, where the lattice phonons substantially soften. Because of their emergent subterahertz collective dynamics, a fundamentally distinct and effective THz coupling mechanism can be envisaged in topological polar structures recently discovered in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices. Here, we show that polar skyrmions can be coherently driven into a hidden phase with transient macroscopic polarization, as probed based on THz field-induced second harmonic generation and optical Kerr effects. Such an ultrafast THz-driven phase transition is found to sustain across a broad temperature range of 4-470 K, in accordance with the equilibrium stability field of the skyrmions. Supplemented by dynamical phase-field simulations, we identify the spatial symmetries and relaxation behaviors of the excited collective modes, thereby revealing their correlation with the emergence of the polar phases. Our results unveil the exotic dynamical properties of topological polar structures, which could be technologically exploited given their remarkable flexibility in structure design and tunability under external fields.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Transform Technique for Analyzing Mode I Crack Growth in an Pre- Stressed Monoclinic Crystalline Strip Under Punch Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crux of the present study is to analyze the Mode I crack propagation behavior in a pre-stressed monoclinic crystalline strip of finite thickness and infinite extent. The investigation focuses on the effects of collinear Griffith cracks and dynamic punch loading induced by plane wave propagation. The cracks are assumed to be in motion, and a Galilean transformation is employed to formulate the problem within a moving coordinate system. The boundary value problem is transformed into a system of coupled Cauchy-type singular integral equations, which are solved analytically using the Hilbert transform method. This approach yields elegant closed-form solutions for both the stress intensity factor and the crack opening displacement. The study considers two monoclinic crystalline materials, Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate, and compares their behavior with that of an isotropic material to assess the role of material anisotropy. Numerical simulations and graphical analysis are performed for the crystalline materials with monoclinic symmetry to evaluate the influence of crack velocity, punch loading, material anisotropy, initial stress, and crack geometry on the fracture parameters. As a special case, the system is analyzed under the action of point loading from the punch pressure, and a comparative assessment is conducted between point loading and constant normal punch pressure. The results unveil critical insights into the dynamic fracture behavior of anisotropic materials under localized loading. This understanding enhances failure prediction in high-precision fields such as geomechanics, MEMS, surface acoustic devices, and biosensors.</description>

      <title>Thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal quenching has been used to find metastable materials such as hard steels and metallic glasses. More recently, quenching-based phase control has been applied to correlated electron systems that exhibit metal--insulator, magnetic or superconducting transitions. Despite the discovery of metastable electronic phases, however, how metastability is achieved through the degrees of freedom, which can vary even at low temperatures such as those of an electron, is unclear. Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo simulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different long-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward low temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without ordering if the cooling rate is high enough. Quantitative analysis of the divergent behavior suggests that the energy barrier for eliminating the local structure of competing orders is the origin of this metastability. Thus, the present simulations show that competing interactions play a key role in realizing metastability.</description>

      <title>Light-driven lattice metastability for enhanced superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven quantum materials with on demand properties controlled by external stimuli are critical for emergent quantum technology. In optically tunable superconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface may hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect. In this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering phase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic displacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively manipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and SrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains with selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak photoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and generate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent superconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum phase manipulations at designed interfaces.</description>

      <title>NMR chemical shielding for solid-state systems using spin-orbit coupled ZORA GIPAW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the computation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shielding tensors within linear response theory. Our implementation in the Vienna {\it Ab initio} Simulation Package (VASP) is tailored to solid-state systems by employing periodic boundary conditions and the gauge-including projector augmented waves (GIPAW) approach. Relativistic effects are included on the level of the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA). We discuss the challenges posed by the PAW partial wave basis in describing SOC regarding chemical shielding tensors. Our method is in good agreement with existing local-basis ZORA implementations for a series of Sn, Hg, and Pb molecules and cluster approximations for crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Structural design and multiple magnetic orderings of the intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design, synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of a layered intergrowth compound, Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$. The structure of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ features an alternating arrangement of hexagonal EuCuP block layers and trigonal EuMn$_2$P$_2$ block layers, interconnected through shared Eu planes. This structural hybridization leads to multiple magnetic orderings in Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$: weak antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$ = 80 K, AFM ordering of Eu at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$ = 29 K, a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ = 14.5 K, and weak ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$. The spin configurations at different temperature regions were discussed based on the calculations of magnetic energies for various collinear arrangements. Resistivity measurements reveal a pronounced transition peak at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$, which is suppressed in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in a significant negative magnetoresistance effect. The computed semimetallic band structure, characterized by a small density of states at the Fermi level, aligns well with experimental observations. The successful synthesis of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ and its fascinating magnetic properties highlight the effectiveness of our block-layer design strategy. By assembling magnetic block layers of compounds with compatible crystal symmetries and closely matched lattice parameters, this approach opens exciting avenues for discovering layered materials with unique magnetic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Surface morphology and thickness variation estimation of zeolites via electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeolites, as representative porous materials, possess intricate three-dimensional frameworks that endow them with high surface areas and remarkable catalytic properties. There are a few factors that give a huge influence on the catalytic properties, including the size and connectivity of these three-dimensional channels and atomic level defects. In additional to that, the surface morphology and thickness variation of zeolites particles are essential to their catalytic performances as well. However, it is a significant challenge to characterize these macroscopic properties of zeolites using conventional techniques due to their sensitivity to electron beams. In this study, we introduce surface-adaptive electron ptychography, an advanced approach based on multi-slice electron ptychography, which enables high-precision reconstruction of both local atomic configurations and global structural features in zeolite nanoparticles. By adaptively optimizing probe defocus and slice thickness during the reconstruction process, SAEP successfully resolves surface morphology, thickness variations and atomic structure simultaneously. This integrated framework facilitates a direct and intuitive correlation between zeolite channel structures and particle thickness. Our findings open new pathways for large-scale, comprehensive structure property analysis of beam-sensitive porous materials, deepening the understanding of their catalytic behavior.</description>

      <title>Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved dynamics of GaN waveguide polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a new experimental approach to directly measure the lifetime of guided polaritons arising from the strong-coupling of GaN excitons and the guided photonic modes of a slab waveguide. Using a Fourier imaging setup, combined with spatial filtering of the emission, the emission associated to polaritonic modes with well-defined propagation constants can be selectively analyzed in the temporal domain. By directing it to the entrance slit of a streak camera, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements along the polariton dispersion branch were performed at 40 K, enabling to assess the time decay of polariton modes. By combining this information with the photonic/excitonic fraction corresponding to each polariton mode, extracted from a coupled-oscillators model that indicate a Rabi splitting of $\Omega$ = 80 meV, we could extract the photon lifetime in the waveguide $\tau_\gamma\, =\, 3\pm 1$ ps. This corresponds to a record $Q$-factor in the UV of 16 000. The excitonic reservoir lifetime, which contributes to polariton formation, was determined through TRPL measurements on excitonic luminescence. Finally, measurements conducted at lower temperature highlight secondary feeding mechanisms for the guided polaritonic mode, either via photon recycling from the AlGaN cladding layer or through resonant injection of photons from transitions below the band gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in depth study of p-type doping concentration of mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) mercury cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) thin films. Annealing time was changed under specific conditions to achieve a stable copper (Cu) doping concentration for HgCdTe thin films. Both MWIR and LWIR HgCdTe material were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where different trends were observed between LWIR and MWIR HgCdTe thin films by increasing anneal time. We also report the impact of different thickness (4 micron, 6 micron and 9 micron) along with annealing time on doping level of LWIR HgCdTe thin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronics is a rapidly evolving technology that utilizes the spin of electrons along with their charge to enable high speed, low power and non volatile electronic devices. The development of novel materials with tailored magnetic and electronic properties is critical to exploit the full potential of spintronic applications. Among these, Heusler alloys stand out due to their tunable multifunctional properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of various Heusler based materials including half metallic ferromagnets, spin gapless semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, spin semimetals, and nearly zero moment materials focusing on their synthesis, structural and magnetic characterizations, and transport behavior. The role of crystal structure, and structural disorder in governing their magnetic and electronic properties is discussed in detail. Emphasis is placed on experimental results and their implications for spintronic devices. By bringing together recent advancements, the review highlights the critical role of Heusler alloys in advancing the next-generation spintronic technologies and outlines future directions for their integration in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Spall strength of symmetric tilt grain boundaries in 6H silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing microstructural effects on the dynamical response of materials is challenging due to the extreme conditions and the short timescales involved. For example, little is known about how grain boundary characteristics affect spall strength. This study explores 6H-SiC bicrystals under shock waves via large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We focused on symmetric tilt grain boundaries with a wide range of misorientations and found that spall strength and dynamical fracture surface energy are strongly affected by the grain boundary microstructure, especially the excess free volume. Grain boundary energy also plays a considerable role. As expected, low-angle grain boundaries tend to have higher spallation strengths. We also extracted cohesive models for the dynamical strength of bulk systems and grain boundaries that can be used in continuum simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at Fc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational physics is integrated throughout the current undergraduate physics curriculum, though there are surprisingly few resources for computational physics in the advanced lab courses. This is despite the fact that a comparison of numerical simulations to experimental results is common practice in modern physics research. In this paper we present a simple experiment in thermal diffusion in metal rods. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature difference on the metal rods due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation using the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. Repeating the experiment with only one end of the rod sunk into an aluminum block (the other floating), we get good qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the numerical model. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Scalable Synthesis of Alkali Metal-Intercalated C$_{60}$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali metal-intercalated C$_{60}$, $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs, and their combinations), holds significant potential for practical applications due to its high superconducting transition temperature (33 K), high upper critical field (900 kOe), and isotropic superconductivity. However, application-oriented research has been limited by the lack of an efficient $A_3$$C_{60}$ synthesis process. In this study, we demonstrate a rapid and scalable synthesis of $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs$_{1/3}$Rb$_{2/3}$) via direct mixing of $A$ and C$_{60}$, realizing the fabrication of high-quality sintered $A_3$$C_{60}$ pellets within just 1 hour of heating at 200-300{\deg}C. The pellets exhibited large superconducting shielding volume fractions with sharp transitions, and the relationship between the lattice constant and transition temperature was in good agreement with previous reports. This direct mixing method enables simple and rapid production of large quantities of $A_3$$C_{60}$, which is expected to accelerate research into applications such as superconducting wires and bulk magnets.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>Optimizing thermoelectric performance of graphene antidot lattices via quantum transport and machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat to electricity or be utilized as solid-state coolers, hold promise for sustainable energy applications. However, optimizing thermoelectric performance remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and thermal transport properties. In this work, we systematically optimize $ZT$ in graphene antidot lattices (GALs), nanostructured graphene sheets with periodic nanopores characterized by two geometric parameters: the hexagonal unit cell side length $L$ and the antidot radius $R$. The lattice thermal conductivity is determined through machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while electronic transport properties are computed using linear-scaling quantum transport in combination with MD trajectories based on a bond-length-dependent tight-binding model. This method is able to account for electron-phonon scattering, allowing access to diffusive transport in large-scale systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods based on nonequilibrium Green function formalism. Our results show that the introduction of the antidots effectively decouples lattice and electronic transport and lead to a favorable and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find that optimal $ZT$ values occur in GALs with intermediate $L$ and $R$, closely correlated with peak power factor values. Notably, thermoelectric performance peaks near room temperature, with maximal $ZT$ values approaching 2, highlighting GALs as promising candidates for high-performance thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Magnetically disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnets Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids~(QSLs) represent a unique quantum disordered state of matter that hosts long-range quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. However, structural disorder resulting from site mixing between different types of ions usually arises in real QSL candidates, which is considered as an obstacle to gain the insight into the intrinsic physics. Here, we have synthesized two new rare-earth compounds Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice structure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do not capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8~K. A fit to low-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with the Curie-Weiss temperature of -1.40~K and -0.43~K for Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$, respectively. Specific heat results show no sign of long-range magnetic order down to $\sim$0.1~K either, but only a Schottky anomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields. Additionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy spin excitations in Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. The absence of magnetic excitation signals as well as static magnetic order down to 97~mK aligns with the results from magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings point to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics, reminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for further exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research delves into the synthesis and characterization of novel liquid crystal compounds derived from benzo[b]Ithiophene cores, focusing on their potential applications in microwave technology. Two synthetic strategies were developed to construct rigid cores, resulting in the successful synthesis of ten compounds with varied terminal groups and lateral substituents. Correlations between molecular structure and mesomorphic properties were elucidated through extensive comparative analysis. Birefringence measurements and quantum chemical calculations further provided insights into the optical properties and polarizability anisotropy of the synthesized compounds. The results highlight the influence of structural diversity on the compounds' suitability for microwave applications. Specifically, compounds featuring carbon-carbon triple bonds and polar terminal groups demonstrated enhanced birefringence and polarizability values, indicating their potential in microwave device fabrication. This study underscores the importance of molecular design in optimizing liquid crystal materials for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a graphene Josephson junction where the inner graphene layer is subjected to spin-orbit coupling by proximity effect. This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.</description>

      <title>All-dielectric Metaphotonics for Advanced THz Control of Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While nearly single cycle THz pulse is conventionally accepted as the stimulus for the fastest and the most energy efficient control of spins in magnets, all-dielectric metasurfaces have been recently demonstrated to be the least dissipative mean to enhance and control the coupling of light to spins. All-dielectric metasurfaces for the THz control of spins hold great potential in the field of spintronics and related technologies, pushing the boundaries of speed and energy efficiency in spin-based information processing. Here we demonstrate such a metasurface for an advanced THz control of spins in a ferrimagnetic film of iron garnet. Structuring a nonmagnetic substrate one can force a THz electromagnetic field, otherwise described by plane waves, to acquire an out-of-plane magnetic field and thus enable arbitrary direction of the torque acting on spins in all three dimensions. Hence, metaphotonics opens up a plethora of opportunities for advanced control of spins at THz rates in many hot fields of contemporary science, including spintronics, magnonics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>From surface roughness to crater formation in a 2D multi-scale simulation of ultrashort pulse laser ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface roughness plays a critical role in ultrashort pulse laser ablation, particularly for industrial applications using burst mode operations, multi-pulse laser processing, and the generation of laser-induced periodic surface structures. Hence, we address the impact of surface roughness on the resulting laser ablation topography predicted by a simulation model and compared to experimental results. We present a comprehensive multi-scale simulation framework that first employs finite-difference-time-domain simulations for calculating the surface fluence distribution on a rough surface measured by an atomic-force-microscope followed by the two-temperature model coupled with hydrodynamic/solid mechanics simulation for the initial material heating. Lastly, a computational fluid dynamics model for material relaxation and fluid flow is developed and employed. Final state results of aluminum and AISI 304 stainless steel simulations demonstrated alignment with established ablation models and crater dimension prediction. Notably, Al exhibited significant optical scattering effects due to initial surface roughness of 15 nm - being 70 times below the laser wavelength, leading to localized, selective ablation processes and substantially altered crater topography compared to idealized conditions. Contrary, AISI 304 with RMS roughness of 2 nm showed no difference. Hence, we highlight the necessity of incorporating realistic, material-specific surface roughness values into large-scale ablation simulations. Furthermore, the induced local fluence variations demonstrated the inadequacy of neglecting lateral heat transport effects in this context.</description>

      <title>polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.</description>

      <title>Metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrochlore oxides with chemical formula of A2B2O7 exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties as a representative family of quantum materials. These properties mostly stem from strong electron correlations at the transition metal B site and typical geometrical frustration effects on the pyrochlore lattice. Furthermore, the coupling between the magnetic moments of the rare-earth A site and the conduction electrons at the B site, along with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling particularly affecting the 4d/5d electrons at the B site, gives rise to the topological characteristics of the correlated electrons. This review paper focuses on the metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides as evidence of the strong electron correlation, which is highlighted as a rich source of intriguing charge dynamics coupled with frustrated spin-orbital entangled magnetism.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale infrared and microwave imaging of stacking faults in multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

      <title>Twin branching in shape memory alloys: a 1D model with energy dissipation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a 1D model of twin branching in shape memory alloys. The free energy of the branched microstructure comprises the interfacial and elastic strain energy contributions, both expressed in terms of the average twin spacing treated as a continuous function of the position. The total free energy is then minimized, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is solved numerically using the finite element method. The model can be considered as a continuous counterpart of the recent discrete model of Seiner et al. (2020), and our results show a very good agreement with that model in the entire range of physically relevant parameters. Furthermore, our continuous setting facilitates incorporation of energy dissipation into the model. The effect of rate-independent dissipation on the evolution of the branched microstructure is thus studied. The results show that significant effects on the microstructure and energy of the system are expected only for relatively small domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Reveals Composition Dependent Thermal Stability in Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit unpredictable properties in response to environmental stressors, due to several composition-dependent degradation mechanisms. In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (&gt;85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (&gt;75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Dynamics Study of Size Effects for Critical Resolved Shear Stress in Nickel Superalloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this work a molecular dynamics study of a size effect relating to the volume fraction of gamma-prime precipitate of edge dislocation motion in a simple model of Nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic gamma-prime precipitates inside a uniform gamma matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the gamma phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the gamma-prime precipitate for a wide range of temperatures, from 300 K to 700 K. While the variation of dislocation velocity is not significant, the critical resolved shear stress is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the gamma-prime precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors; we also observe that this two-regime behavior remains true across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the critical resolved shear stress on the length of the gamma-prime precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure gamma-prime system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. The results presented in this work provides new details on the strengthening effect of gamma-prime precipitates in nickel superalloys and also has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.</description>

      <title>A strategy for the enhancement of barocaloric performance in plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|$\Delta S_{it,rev}$| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span }$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Datatractor: Metadata, automation, and registries for extractor interoperability in the chemical and materials sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two key issues hindering the transition towards FAIR data science are the poor discoverability and inconsistent instructions for the use of data extractor tools, i.e., how we go from raw data files created by instruments, to accessible metadata and scientific insight. If the existing format conversion tools are hard to find, install, and use, their reimplementation will lead to a duplication of effort, and an increase in the associated maintenance burden is inevitable. The Datatractor framework presented in this work addresses these issues. First, by providing a curated registry of such extractor tools their discoverability will increase. Second, by describing them using a standardised but lightweight schema, their installation and use is machine-actionable. Finally, we provide a reference implementation for such data extraction. The Datatractor framework can be used to provide a public-facing data extraction service, or be incorporated into other research data management tools providing added value.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable spin disordered phase in the triangular-lattice delafossite TlYbSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice compound TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around ~ 30 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the na\"ive expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.</description>
