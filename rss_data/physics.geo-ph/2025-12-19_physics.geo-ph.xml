      <title>Direct inversion of data-space Hessian for efficient time-domain extended-source waveform inversion using the multiplier method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The augmented Lagrangian (AL) method has been successfully applied for solving the full waveform inversion (FWI) problem. In AL-based FWI, the Lagrange multipliers serve as source extensions, offering several advantages to the inversion, such as improved robustness to cycle skipping, faster convergence, and simplified penalty parameter tuning. Time-domain applications of this method have been enabled by reformulating the optimization problem in the data space, significantly reducing memory requirements by projecting source-side multipliers into the data space. These data-side multipliers act as data extensions, effectively expanding the data space. A key challenge in these methods lies in computing the data-side multipliers, which involves solving a linear system to deblur the data residuals using the data-space Hessian matrix before it serves as the adjoint source. This Hessian matrix is prohibitively large to construct and invert explicitly. Iterative Krylov methods can be applied to solve this system as inner iterations, but they require two PDE solves per inner iteration per source, leading to significant computational costs. In this work, we present a key improvement to extended waveform inversion based on multiplier methods. We propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of Hessian inversion. The method computes receiver-side Green functions in the time domain and directly constructs frequency-domain Hessian matrices for all required frequencies. These Hessian matrices, with dimensions equal to the number of receivers, can be computed, inverted, and stored in memory. Once constructed, they can be used simultaneously for all sources, further enhancing efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the substantial computational gains achieved by the proposed method, highlighting its effectiveness for extended-source FWI in the time domain.</description>

      <title>Self-Affine Scaling of Earth's Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.</description>

      <title>Automatic Penalty Parameter Selection by Residual Whiteness Principle (RWP) and GCV for Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful seismic imaging technique used to estimate high-resolution physical properties of subsurface structures by minimizing the misfit between observed and modeled seismic data. FWI is inherently a highly non-linear and ill-posed inverse problem. Extended-source approaches, such as the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, are employed to improve solution convexity and robustness. A key component of this formulation is the penalty parameter, which controls the trade-off between data fitting and satisfaction of the wave-equation constraint, strongly influencing convergence in the presence of noise. The main challenge lies in selecting the penalty parameter. Traditional strategies such as the Discrepancy Principle (DP) require an accurate estimate of the noise level, which is often unknown or poorly characterized. Moreover, trial-and-error tuning requires repeatedly solving the inverse problem, making it computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations and develop a parameter-free, computationally efficient extended-source FWI algorithm, we integrate two data-driven parameter-selection strategies--the Residual Whiteness Principle (RWP) and a stable variant of Generalized Cross-Validation (RGCV)--within a multiplier-oriented AL framework. Specifically, we adopt a dual-space AL formulation, which allows the background wave-equation operator to remain fixed and requires only a single LU factorization per frequency, significantly improving efficiency. This design enables dynamic adjustment of the parameter at negligible cost during iterations, making the algorithm scalable for large-scale applications. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI with white and colored noise show that, combined with the dual-space formulation, RWP provides strong noise robustness, resulting in a reliable automated solution for large-scale seismic inversion.</description>
