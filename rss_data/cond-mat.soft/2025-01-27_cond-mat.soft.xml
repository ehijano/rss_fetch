      <title>Active bacterial baths in droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of self-propelled objects represent a novel paradigm in colloidal science. In such active baths traditional concepts, such as Brownian motion, fluctuation-dissipation relations, and work extraction from heat reservoirs, must be extended beyond the conventional framework of thermal baths. Unlike thermal baths, which are characterized by a single parameter, the temperature, the fundamental descriptors of an active bath remain elusive, especially in confined environments. In this study, buoyant, passive tracers are employed as generalized probes to investigate an active bath comprising motile bacteria confined within a droplet. We demonstrate that momentum transfer from the bath to the tracer can be effectively described as colored noise, characterized by temporal memory and an enhanced effective diffusivity significantly larger compared to thermal Brownian motion values. Using a stochastic analytical framework, we extract the temporal memory and diffusivity parameters that define such an active bath. Notably, the diffusivity scales linearly with bacterial concentration, modulated by a factor representing the role of confinement, expressed as the ratio of the confining radius to the probe radius. This finding, while still awaiting a complete theoretical explanation, offers new insights into the transport properties of confined active baths and paves the way for a deeper understanding of active emulsions driven by confined active matter.</description>

      <title>Optimal disk packing of chloroplasts in plant cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthesis is vital for the survival of entire ecosystems on Earth. While light is fundamental to this process, excessive exposure can be detrimental to plant cells. Chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles, actively move in response to light and self-organize within the cell to tune light absorption. These disk-shaped motile organelles must balance dense packing for enhanced light absorption under dim conditions with spatial rearrangements to avoid damage from excessive light exposure. Here, we reveal that the packing characteristics of chloroplasts within plant cells show signatures of optimality. Combining measurements of chloroplast densities and three-dimensional cell shape in the water plant Elodea densa, we construct an argument for optimal cell shape versus chloroplast size to achieve two targets: dense packing into a two-dimensional monolayer for optimal absorption under dim light conditions and packing at the sidewalls for optimal light avoidance. We formalize these constraints using a model for random close packing matched with packing simulations of polydisperse hard disks confined within rectangular boxes. The optimal cell shape resulting from these models corresponds closely to that measured in the box-like plant cells, highlighting the importance of particle packing in the light adaptation of plants. Understanding the interplay between structure and function sheds light on how plants achieve efficient photo adaptation. It also highlights a broader principle: how cell shape relates to the optimization of packing finite and relatively small numbers of organelles under confinement. This universal challenge in biological systems shares fundamental features with the mechanics of confined granular media and the jamming transitions in dense active and passive systems across various scales and contexts.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Mechanical and Mdchano-Thermal Effects in Liquids Explained by means of the Dual Model of Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue to illustrate the capabilities of the Dual Model of Liquids showing that it may explain crossed effects notable in Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that the DML may correctly model the thermodiffusion, in particular getting formal expressions for positive and negative Soret coefficient, and another unexpected mechano-thermal effect recently discovered in liquids submitted to shear strain, for which the first-ever theoretical interpretation is provided.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Inversion from Small-Angle Scattering for Charged Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop Monte Carlo simulations for uniformly charged polymers and machine learning algorithm to interpret the intra-polymer structure factor of the charged polymer system, which can be obtained from small-angle scattering experiments. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds, where the connected bonds are subject to bending energy, and there is also a screened Coulomb potential for charge interaction between all joints. The bending energy is determined by the intrinsic bending stiffness, and the charge interaction depends on the interaction strength and screening length. All three contribute to the stiffness of the polymer chain and lead to longer and larger polymer conformations. The screening length also introduces a second length scale for the polymer besides the bending persistence length. To obtain the inverse mapping from the structure factor to these polymer conformation and energy-related parameters, we generate a large data set of structure factors by running simulations for a wide range of polymer energy parameters. We use principal component analysis to investigate the intra-polymer structure factors and determine the feasibility of the inversion using the nearest neighbor distance. We employ Gaussian process regression to achieve the inverse mapping and extract the characteristic parameters of polymers from the structure factor with low relative error.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Birhythmicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics are present in many aspects of our lives, ranging from microscopic physical systems to the functioning of the brain. What characterizes stochastic models of non-equilibrium processes is the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation relations as well as the existence of non-static stable states, or phases. A prototypical example is a dynamical phase characterized by a limit cycle - the order parameter of finite magnitude rotating or oscillating at a fixed frequency. Consequently, birhythmicity, where two stable limit cycles coexist, is a natural extension of the simpler single limit cycle phase. Both the abundance of real systems exhibiting such states as well as their relevance for building our understanding of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions are strong motivations to build and study models of such behavior. Field theoretic tools can be used to provide insights into either phase and the transition between them. In this work we explore a simple linear model of the single limit cycle phase with phase-amplitude coupling. We demonstrate how such non-equilibrium coupling affects the fluctuation spectrum of the theory. We then extend this model to include a continuous transition to a two-cycle phase. We give various results, such as an appearance of a critical exceptional point, the destruction of the transition, enhancement of noise for the phase and the presence of KPZ dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate these results with numerics and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Topological edge flows drive macroscopic re-organization in magnetic colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic colloids can be driven with time-varying fields to form clusters and voids that re-organize over vastly different timescales. However, the driving force behind these non-equilibrium dynamics is not well-understood. Here, we introduce a topological framework that predicts protected edge flows despite strong thermal motion. Notably, these edge flows produce shear stress that creates global rotation of clusters but not of voids. We verify this theory experimentally using micron-sized super-paramagnetic colloids to demonstrate these emergent physical predictions and show how they drive system re-organization differentially at long timescales. Our results elucidate fundamental principles that shape and control non-equilibrium colloidal aggregates.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Topology Optimization of Differentiable and Non-Differentiable Objectives via Morphology Learning: Stiffness and Cell Growth on Scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization of microstructures plays a critical role in optimizing functional performance across diverse engineering applications. While metamaterials with enhanced mechanical properties -- such as hyperelasticity, energy absorption, and thermal efficiency -- are commonly designed using complex microstructural geometries and multi-physics simulations, achieving the simultaneous optimization of mechanical performance and non-differentiable objectives remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous topology optimization of differentiable and non-differentiable objectives via a data-driven morphology learning approach. The framework extracts shape patterns from a curated dataset of microstructures recognized for their superior performance in specific functional applications. To showcase the versatility of the approach, we apply it to the optimization of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, with cell growth as a representative functional objective. By integrating learned morphology patterns into a topology optimization process, the method generates microstructures that effectively balance mechanical stiffness and biological performance, such as enhanced cell proliferation. As a case study, we demonstrate a scaffold design that improves mechanical stiffness by 29.69% and cell growth by 37.05% on Day 7 and 33.30% on Day 14. This approach highlights the general applicability of the proposed framework for optimizing a broad range of engineering challenges, beyond the specific case of cell growth.</description>

      <title>Information system for analysis of nanostructure morphology: Education and research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the development of an information system ISANM that will be useful for teaching students and applicable in the work of engineers and researchers for automating the analysis of colloidal structure morphology. The ISANM system integrates various analysis methods and is designed prioritize usability, catering primarily to users rather than software developers. This paper outlines the scope of the subject area, reviews selected methods for morphology analysis, and presents the scripts developed for implementing these methods in Python. In the future, new methods and tools will be gradually added to the system for chemical engineers, physicists, and materials scientists. We hope that the system implementation methodology described here will be useful in the implementation of other projects related to training chemical engineers and beyond. The system core is implemented in C#, utilizing the .NET Framework and the MS SQL Server, and is developed within the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 environment on Windows 10 using the client-server architecture. The system has been deployed on a VDS server using the Ubuntu 20.04 distribution. MS SQL Server is used as the database management system. The system can be accessed at https://isanm.space. Geometric analysis of colloidal structures is significant in applications such as photonic crystals for optoelectronics and microelectronics, functional coatings in materials science, and biosensors for medical and environmental applications. This demonstrates the importance of digitalization in this area to improve the quality of student education.</description>
