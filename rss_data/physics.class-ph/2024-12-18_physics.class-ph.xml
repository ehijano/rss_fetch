      <title>Angle-Invariant Scattering in Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are efficient and versatile electromagnetic structures that have already enabled the implementation of a wide range of microwave and photonic wave shaping applications. Despite the extensive research into metasurfaces, a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their angular dispersion remains vastly under-explored. Here, we use the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) to model and analyze the angular dispersive properties of metasurfaces. Based on this theoretical framework, we demonstrate that a metasurface may exhibit either partial or complete co- and cross-polarized transmission and reflection coefficients that are angle-invariant, meaning that their amplitude, phase, or both remain unchanged with varying incidence angles. We show that these angle-independent responses exist only when specific conditions, given in terms of the metasurface effective susceptibilities, are met. Using the GSTCs formalism, we derive several of these conditions and illustrate their scattering properties. Among other findings, this analysis reveals that, contrary to common assumptions, nonlocality (spatial dispersion) does not only increase the angular dispersion of a metasurface, but may also be used to achieve complete angle-invariant scattering. Additionally, this work demonstrates that fully efficient extrinsic chirality is possible with a pseudochiral metasurface in a partially angle-invariant fashion. We expect our work to provide a general strategy for eliminating, or at least reducing, angular-dependent scattering responses of metasurfaces, which may prove instrumental for applications that are highly sensitive to the detrimental effects of angular dispersion.</description>

      <title>Motion of a floating sphere pulled by a string and induced flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in this article the motion of a floating ball attached to a soft string set in circular motion through its other end. Although simple, the system exhibits rich dynamics that we investigate experimentally and theoretically. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which challenges common intuition based on centrifugal force. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. Experimental measurements of the generated flow show that a Magnus force must be taken into account to correctly explain all the observations. In particular, our deformable system allows to measure the ratio of the lift force over the inertial force. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, showing that the ball can robustly trap itself at the center of the flow generated by its past motion. The present experiment also revisits the famous 'tea-leaf paradox', which refers to the unexpected migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the latter is mixed with a rigid spoon. The ball attached to the string plays the role of a deformable spoon, and we show that there exists a maximum rotation speed above which the tea-leaves transport brutally stops.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Volterra defects: Geometrical relation between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model for Volterra defects and explores their relations using differential geometry on Riemann--Cartan manifolds. Following the standard Volterra process, we derived the Cartan moving frame, a geometric representation of plastic fields, and the associated Riemannian metric using exterior algebra. Although the analysis naturally defines the geometry of three types of dislocations and the wedge disclination, it fails to classify twist disclinations owing to the persistent torsion component, suggesting the need for modifications to the Volterra process. By leveraging the interchangeability of the Weitzenb\"ock and Levi-Civita connections and applying an analytical solution for plasticity derived from the Biot--Savart law, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the long-standing phenomenological relationship between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of novel mathematical tools, including Riemannian holonomy for analysing the Frank vector and complex potentials that encapsulate the topological properties of wedge disclinations as jump discontinuities. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the linearized stress fields of wedge disclinations and confirm their consistency with existing results. These findings demonstrate that the present geometrical framework extends and generalizes the classical theory of Volterra defects.</description>
