      <description>arXiv:2409.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the method to find the hitting probabilities for Gaussian integrators. Using second quantization we obtain the sseries representation for such probabilities despite the fact that integrators can be non-Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Optimality of a barrier strategy in a spectrally negative L\'evy model with a level-dependent intensity of bankruptcy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider de Finetti's stochastic control problem for a spectrally negative L\'evy process in an Omega model. In such a model, the (controlled) process is allowed to spend time under the critical level but is then subject to a level-dependent intensity of bankruptcy. First, before considering the control problem, we derive some analytical properties of the corresponding Omega scale functions. Second, we prove that exists a barrier strategy that is optimal for this control problem under a mild assumption on the L\'evy measure. Finally, we analyse numerically the impact of the bankruptcy rate function on the optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>Regularisation of cylindrical L\'evy processes in Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the irregularity of a given cylindrical L\'evy process $L$ in $L^2({\mathbb R}^d)$ by determining the range of weighted Besov spaces $B$ in which $L$ has a regularised version $Y$, that is a stochastic process $Y$ in the classical sense with values in $B$. Our approach is based on characterising L\'evy measures on Besov spaces. As a by-product, we determine those Besov spaces $B$ for which the embedding of $L^2({\mathbb R}^d)$ into $B$ is $0$-Radonifying and $p$-Radonifying for $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for macroscopic observables of heavy-tailed matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite collection of independent Hermitian heavy-tailed random matrices of growing dimension. Our model includes the L\'evy matrices proposed by Bouchaud and Cizeau, as well as sparse random matrices with O(1) non-zero entries per row. By representing these matrices as weighted graphs, we derive a large deviations principle for key macroscopic observables. Specifically, we focus on the empirical distribution of eigenvalues, the joint neighborhood distribution, and the joint traffic distribution. As an application, we define a notion of microstates entropy for traffic distributions which is additive for free traffic convolution.</description>

      <title>Large deviations principle for invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small noise asymptotic for stochastic Burgers equations on $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary condition. We consider the case that the noise is more singular than space-time white noise. We let the noise magnitude $\sqrt{\epsilon} \rightarrow 0$ and the covariance operator $Q_\epsilon$ is convergent to $(-\Delta)^{\frac 1 2}$ and prove a large deviations principle for solutions, uniformly with respect to the initial value of equation. Furthermore, we set $Q_\epsilon$ to be a trace class operator and converge to $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ in a suitable way such that the invariant measures exist. Then, we prove the large deviations principle for the invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations.</description>

      <title>Study of discrete-time Hawkes process and its compensator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete-time Hawkes process (DTHP) is a sub-class of $g$-functions that serves as a discrete-time version of the continuous-time Hawkes process (CTHP). Like the CTHP, the DTHP also has the self-exciting property and its intensity depends on the entire history. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the DTHP and its compensator. We further analyse the moment generating function (MGF) of the DTHP and obtain some bounds and convergence results on the scaled logarithmic MGF of the DTHP.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics Related to a Binary Search Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specimens are collected from $N$ different sources. Each specimen has probability $p$ of being contaminated, independently of the other specimens. We assume group testing is applicable, namely one can take small portions from several specimens, mix them together, and test the mixture for contamination, so that if the test turns positive, then at least one of the samples in the mixture is contaminated.
  In this paper we derive asymptotics, as $N$ gets large, of the expectation and the variance of the number $T(N)$ of tests required in order to find all contaminated specimens, under the binary search scheme we introduced in \cite{P} (see, also, arXiv:2007.11910). In \cite{P} the probability $p$ was fixed, whereas in the present work we consider the case where $p \sim a / N^{-\beta}$, $a, \beta &gt; 0$ with emphasis on the case $\beta = 1$, which turns out to be the most interesting.</description>

      <title>An explicit Wishart moment formula for the product of two disjoint principal minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first explicit formula for the expectation of the product of two disjoint principal minors of a Wishart random matrix, solving a part of a broader problem put forth by Samuel S. Wilks in 1934 in the Annals of Mathematics. The proof makes crucial use of hypergeometric functions of matrix argument and their Laplace transforms. Additionally, a Wishart generalization of the Gaussian product inequality conjecture is formulated and a stronger quantitative version is proved to hold in the case of two minors.</description>

      <title>The continuous-time limit of quasi score-driven volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the continuous-time limit of a class of Quasi Score-Driven (QSD) models that characterize volatility. As the sampling frequency increases and the time interval tends to zero, the model weakly converges to a continuous-time stochastic volatility model where the two Brownian motions are correlated, thereby capturing the leverage effect in the market. Subsequently, we identify that a necessary condition for non-degenerate correlation is that the distribution of driving innovations differs from that of computing score, and at least one being asymmetric. We then illustrate this with two typical examples. As an application, the QSD model is used as an approximation for correlated stochastic volatility diffusions and quasi maximum likelihood estimation is performed. Simulation results confirm the method's effectiveness, particularly in estimating the correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>On the Palm distribution of superposition of point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palm distributions are critical in the study of point processes. In the present paper we focus on a point process $\Phi$ defined as the superposition, i.e., sum, of two independent point processes, say $\Phi = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2$, and we characterize its Palm distribution. In particular, we show that the Palm distribution of $\Phi$ admits a simple mixture representation depending only on the Palm distribution of $\Phi_j$, as $j=1, 2$, and the associated moment measures. Extensions to the superposition of multiple point processes, and higher order Palm distributions, are treated analogously.</description>

      <title>Law of large numbers for greedy animals and paths in an ergodic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a family of random masses $\mathbf{m}(v)$ indexed by vertices of the lattice $\mathbb Z^d$. In the case where the masses are i.i.d.\ and satisfy a certain moment condition, it is known that there exists a deterministic $A\ge 0$ such that the maximal mass $A_n$ of an animal containing $0$ with cardinal $n$ satisfies $A_n/n \rightarrow A$ when $n\to \infty$, almost surely. The same also goes for self-avoiding paths. We extend this result to the case where the family of masses is an ergodic marked point process, with a suitable definition for animals in this context. Special cases include the initial model with ergodic instead of i.i.d.\ masses and marked Poisson point processes. We also discuss some sufficient or necessary conditions for integrability.</description>

      <title>The KPZ Fixed Point and the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term 'KPZ' stands for the initials of three physicists, namely Kardar, Parisi and Zhang, which, in 1986 conjectured the existence of universal scaling behaviours for many random growth processes in the plane. A process is said to belong to the KPZ universality class if one can associate to it an appropriate 'height function' and show that its 3:2:1 (time : space: fluctuation) scaling limit, see 1.2, converges to a universal random process, the KPZ fixed point. Alternatively, membership is loosely characterised by having: 1. Local dynamics; 2. A smoothing mechanism; 3. Slope-dependent growth rate (lateral growth); 4. Space-time random forcing with the rapid decay of correlations.
  The central object that we will study is the so-called KPZ fixed point, which belongs to the KPZ universality class. Many strides have been made in the last couple of decades in this field, with constructions of the KPZ fixed point from certain processes such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (with arbitrary initial condition) and Brownian last passage percolation.
  In this article, we: 1. delineate the origins of KPZ universality; 2. describe and motivate canonical models; 3. give an overview of recent developments, especially those in the 2018 Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virag (DOV) paper; 4. present the strategy of and key points in the proof of the absolute continuity result of the KPZ fixed point by Sarkar and Virag; 5. conclude with remarks for future directions. The presentation is such that the content is displayed in a way that is as self-contained as possible and aimed at a motivated audience that has mastered the fundamentals of the theory of probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random trigonometric polynomials with general dependent coefficients. We show that under mild hypotheses on the structure of dependence, the asymptotics as the degree goes to infinity of the expected number of real zeros coincides with the independent case. To the best of our knowledge, this universality result is the first obtained in a non-Gaussian dependent context. Our proof highlights the robustness of real zeros, even in the presence of dependencies. These findings bring the behavior of random polynomials closer to real-world models, where dependencies between coefficients are common.</description>

      <title>Rank-based stochastic differential inclusions and diffusion limits for a load balancing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, a randomized load balancing model was studied in a heavy traffic asymptotic regime where the load balancing stream is thin compared to the total arrival stream. It was shown that the limit is given by a system of rank-based Brownian particles on the half-line. This paper extends these results from the case of exponential service time to an invariance principle, where service times have finite second moment. The main tool is a new notion of rank-based stochastic differential inclusion, which may be of interest in its own right.</description>

      <title>Control of Conditional Processes and Fleming--Viot Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss equivalent formulations of the control of conditional processes introduced by Lions. In this problem, a controlled diffusion process is killed once it hits the boundary of a bounded domain and the controller's reward is computed based on the conditional distribution given the process's survival. So far there is no clarity regarding the relationship between the open- and closed-loop formulation of this nonstandard control problem. We provide a short proof of their equivalence using measurable selection and mimicking arguments. In addition, we link the closed-loop formulation to Fleming--Viot dynamics of McKean--Vlasov type, where upon being killed the diffusion process is reinserted into the domain according to the current law of the process itself. This connection offers a new interpretation of the control problem and opens it up to applications that feature costs caused by reinsertion.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Casimir Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the one-dimensional `classical' vacuum by a system of annihilating Brownian motions on $\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise immigration. A pair of reflecting or absorbing walls placed in such a vacuum at separation $L$ experiences an attractive force which decays exponentially with $L$. This phenomenon can be regarded as a purely classical Casimir effect for a system of interacting Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution of accelerated exponential Euler method for parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic error distribution of numerical methods applied to stochastic ordinary differential equations has been well studied, which characterizes the evolution pattern of the error distribution in the small step-size regime. It is still open for stochastic partial differential equations whether the normalized error process of numerical methods admits a nontrivial limit distribution. We answer this question by presenting the asymptotic error distribution of the temporal accelerated exponential Euler (AEE) method when applied to parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the infinite-dimensional setting, we establish a uniform approximation theorem for convergence in distribution. Based on it, we derive the limit distribution of the normalized error process of the AEE method by studying the limit distribution of its certain appropriate finite-dimensional approximation process. As applications of our main result, the asymptotic error distribution of a fully discrete AEE method for the original equation and that of the AEE method for a stochastic ordinary differential equation are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence problem in the setting of mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Our main results establish a rate of convergence of the finite-dimensional value functions $V^N$ towards the mean field value function $U$. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise is constant (but possibly degenerate), we obtain the rate $N^{-1/(d+7)}$, which is close to the conjectured optimal rate $N^{-1/d}$, and improves on the existing literature even in the non-degenerate setting. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise can be both non-constant and degenerate, the argument is more complicated, and we instead find the rate $N^{-1/(3d + 19)}$. Our proof strategy builds on the one initiated in [Daudin, Delarue, Jackson - JFA, 2024] in the case of non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise and zero common noise, which consists of approximating $U$ by more regular functions which are almost subsolutions of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation solved by $U$. Because of the different noise structure, several new steps are necessary in order to produce an appropriate mollification scheme. In addition to our main convergence results, we investigate the case of zero idiosyncratic noise, and show that sharper results can be obtained there by purely control-theoretic arguments. We also provide examples to demonstrate that the value function is sensitive to the choice of admissible controls in the zero noise setting.</description>

      <title>Correlation Function of Self-Conjugate Partitions: $q$-Difference Equation and Quasimodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the uniform measure for the self-conjugate partitions. We derive the $q$-difference equation which is satisfied by the $n$-point correlation function related to the uniform measure. As applications, we give explicit formulas for the one-point and two-point functions, and study their quasimodularity. Motivated by this, we also prove the quasimodularity of the general $n$-point function using a combinatorial method. Finally, we derive the limit shape of self-conjugate partitions under the Gibbs uniform measure and compare it to the leading asymptotics of the one-point function.</description>

      <title>The discrete analogue of the Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper illustrates the utility of the heat kernel on $\mathbb{Z}$ as the discrete analogue of the Gaussian density function. It is the two-variable function $K_{\mathbb{Z}}(t,x)=e^{-2t}I_{x}(2t)$ involving a Bessel function and variables $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ and real $t\geq 0$. Like its classic counterpart it appears in many mathematical and physical contexts and has a wealth of applications. Some of these will be reviewed here, concerning Bessel integrals, trigonometric sums, hypergeometric functions and asymptotics of discrete models appearing in statistical and quantum physics. Moreover, we prove a new local limit theorem for sums of integer-valued random variables, obtain novel special values of the spectral zeta function of Bethe lattices, and provide a discussion on how $e^{-2t}I_{x}(2t)$ could be useful in differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Minimum degree $k$ and $k$-connectedness usually arrive together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14398v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $d,n\in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $d=\omega(1)$, and $d\le n^{1-a}$ for some constant $a&gt;0$. Consider a $d$-regular graph $G=(V, E)$ and the random graph process that starts with the empty graph $G(0)$ and at each step $G(i)$ is obtained from $G(i-1)$ by adding uniformly at random a new edge from $E$. We show that if $G$ satisfies some (very) mild global edge-expansion, and an almost optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $O(d\log n)$, then for any constant $k\in \mathbb{N}$ in the random graph process on $G$, typically the hitting times of minimum degree at least $k$ and of $k$-connectedness are equal. This, in particular, covers both $d$-regular high dimensional product graphs and pseudo-random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Joos from 2015. We further demonstrate that this result is tight in the sense that there are $d$-regular $n$-vertex graphs with optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $\Omega(d)$, for which the probability threshold of minimum degree at least one is different than the probability threshold of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Ages, sizes and (trees within) trees of taxa and of urns, from Yule to today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper written in 1925 by G. Udny Yule that we celebrate in this special issue introduces several novelties and results that we recall in detail.
  First, we discuss Yule (1925)'s main legacies over the past century, focusing on empirical frequency distributions with heavy tails and random tree models for phylogenies. We estimate the year when Yule's work was re-discovered by scientists interested in stochastic processes of population growth (1948) and the year from which it began to be cited (1951, Yule's death). We highlight overlooked aspects of Yule's work (e.g., the Yule process of Yule processes) and correct some common misattributions (e.g., the Yule tree).
  Second, we generalize Yule's results on the average frequency of genera of a given age and size (number of species). We show that his formula also applies to the age $A$ and size $S$ of any randomly chosen genus and that the pairs $(A_i, S_i)$ are equally distributed and independent across genera. This property extends to triples $(H_i, A_i, S_i)$, where $(H_i)$ are the coalescence times of the genus phylogeny, even when species diversification within genera follows any integer-valued process, including species extinctions. Studying $(A, S)$ in this broader context allows us to identify cases where $S$ has a power-law tail distribution, with new applications to urn schemes.</description>

      <title>A convergent scheme for the Bayesian filtering problem based on the Fokker--Planck equation and deep splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical scheme for approximating the nonlinear filtering density is introduced and its convergence rate is established, theoretically under a parabolic H\"{o}rmander condition, and empirically for two examples. For the prediction step, between the noisy and partial measurements at discrete times, the scheme approximates the Fokker--Planck equation with a deep splitting scheme, and performs an exact update through Bayes' formula. This results in a classical prediction-update filtering algorithm that operates online for new observation sequences post-training. The algorithm employs a sampling-based Feynman--Kac approach, designed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Our convergence proof relies on the Malliavin integration-by-parts formula. As a corollary we obtain the convergence rate for the approximation of the Fokker--Planck equation alone, disconnected from the filtering problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the second moment of the determinant of random symmetric, Wigner, and Hermitian matrices. Using analytic combinatorics techniques, we determine the second moment of the determinant of Hermitian matrices whose entries on the diagonal are i.i.d and whose entries above the diagonal are i.i.d. and have real expected values. Our results extend previous work analyzing the second moment of the determinant of symmetric and Wigner matrices, providing a unified approach for this analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper, written for the second edition of the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, provides an introduction to the study of convergence analysis for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), aimed at researchers new to the field. We focus on methods for constructing bounds on the distance between the distribution of a Markov chain at a given time and its stationary distribution. Two widely-used approaches are explored: the coupling method and the L2 theory of Markov chains. For the latter, we emphasize techniques based on conductance and isoperimetric inequalities. Additionally, we briefly discuss strategies for identifying slow convergence in Markov chains.</description>

      <title>From Stochastic Zakharov System to Multiplicative Stochastic Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a Zakharov system driven by a time white noise, colored in space, to a multiplicative stochastic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, as the ion-sound speed tends to infinity. In the absence of noise, the conservation of energy gives bounds on the solutions, but this evolution becomes singular in the presence of the noise. To overcome this difficulty, we show that the problem may be recasted in the diffusion-approximation framework, and make use of the perturbed test-function method. We also obtain convergence in probability. The result is limited to dimension one, to avoid too much technicalities. As a prerequisite, we prove the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions of the stochastic Zakharov system.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic approach to the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ an odd prime such that $E$ has good ordinary reduction at $p$ and the Galois representation on $E[p]$ is irreducible. Then Greenberg's $\mu=0$ conjecture predicts that the Selmer group of $E$ over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ is cofinitely generated as a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module. In this article we study this conjecture from a statistical perspective. We extend the heuristics of Poonen and Rains to obtain further evidence for Greenberg's conjecture. The key idea is that the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant can be detected by the intersection $M_1\cap M_2$ of two Iwasawa modules $M_1, M_2$ with additional properties in a given inner product space. The heuristic is based on showing that there is a probability measure on the space of pairs $(M_1, M_2)$ respect to which the event that $M_1\cap M_2$ is finite happens with probability $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, the opinions of individual agents evolve with time. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if those opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, it is typically assumed that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social systems. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social interactions, which can follow arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We find that BCMs with Markovian WTDs have consistent statistical properties on different networks but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian WTDs depend on network structure.</description>

      <title>From Gini index as a Lyapunov functional to convergence in Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several recent works on infinite-dimensional systems of ODEs \cite{cao_derivation_2021,cao_explicit_2021,cao_iterative_2024,cao_sticky_2024}, which arise from the mean-field limit of agent-based models in economics and social sciences and model the evolution of probability distributions (on the set of non-negative integers), it is often shown that the Gini index serves as a natural Lyapunov functional along the solution to a given system. Furthermore, the Gini index converges to that of the equilibrium distribution. However, it is not immediately clear whether this convergence at the level of the Gini index implies convergence in the sense of probability distributions or even stronger notions of convergence. In this paper, we prove several results in this direction, highlighting the interplay between the Gini index and other popular metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance and the usual $\ell^p$ distance, which are used to quantify the closeness of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Edge universality of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi directed graph $\mathscr G(N,p)$. We denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$ by $\lambda_1^{\cal A},...,\lambda^{\cal A}_N$, and $|\lambda_1^{\cal A}|=\max_i|\lambda_i^{\cal A}|$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that \[ \max_{i=2,3,...,N} \bigg|\frac{\lambda_i^{\mathcal A}}{\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}\bigg| =1+O(N^{-1/2+o(1)}) \] with very high probability. In addition, we prove that near the unit circle, the local eigenvalue statistics of ${\mathcal A}/\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$ coincide with those of the real Ginibre ensemble. As a by-product, we also show that all non-trivial eigenvectors of $\mathcal A$ are completely delocalized.
  For Hermitian random matrices, it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity: in the very sparse regime, one needs to remove many noise random variables (which affect both the mean and the fluctuation) to recover the Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results imply that, compared to their analogues in the Hermitian case, the edge statistics of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust.
  The edge of non-Hermitian matrices possesses the cusp singularity, which was believed to be a technical difficulty of the model. Our first novelty is the observation that the cusp singularity is in fact an advantage instead of an obstacle, and when used properly, it can make the computation easier for non-Hermitian matrices. The second novelty is an use of integration by parts formula inside the Girko's Hermitization, which completely avoids the study of the Green function at larger spectral scales. The third novelty is the self-similarity of the self-consistent equations of certain Green functions, which eliminates the effect of large expectations of the matrix entries.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Dynamic Asymmetric Exclusion Process: Orthogonal Dualities and Degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a generalized version of dynamic ASEP is introduced, and it is shown that the process has a Markov duality property with the same process on the reversed lattice. The duality functions are multivariate $q$-Racah polynomials, and the corresponding orthogonality measure is the reversible measure of the process. By taking limits in the generator of dynamic ASEP, its reversible measure, and the duality functions, we obtain orthogonal and triangular dualities for several other interacting particle systems. In this sense, the duality of dynamic ASEP sits on top of a hierarchy of many dualities.
  For the construction of the process, we rely on representation theory of the quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. In the standard representation, the generator of generalized ASEP can be constructed from the coproduct of the Casimir. After a suitable change of representation, we obtain the generator of dynamic ASEP. The corresponding intertwiner is constructed from $q$-Krawtchouk polynomials, which arise as eigenfunctions of twisted primitive elements. This gives a duality between dynamic ASEP and generalized ASEP with $q$-Krawtchouk polynomials as duality functions.

      <title>Fixed-magnetization Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <title>Existence of strong solutions of fractional Brownian sheet driven SDEs with integrable drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a unique Malliavin differentiable strong solution to a stochastic differential equation on the plane with merely integrable coefficients driven by the fractional Brownian sheet with Hurst parameter $H=(H_1,H_2)\in(0,\frac{1}{2})^2$. The proof of this result relies on a compactness criterion for square integrable Wiener functionals from Malliavin calculus ([Da Prato, Malliavin and Nualart, 1992]), variational techniques developed in the case of fractional Brownian motion ([Ba\~nos, Nielssen, and Proske, 2020]) and the concept of sectorial local nondeterminism (introduced in [Khoshnevisan and Xiao, 2007]). The latter concept enable us to improve the bound of the Hurst parameter (compare with [Ba\~nos, Nielssen, and Proske, 2020]).</description>

      <title>Metastability cascades and prewetting in the SOS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Glauber dynamics for the low temperature $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid model on a box of side-length $n$ with a floor at height $0$ (inducing entropic repulsion) and a competing bulk external field $\lambda$ pointing down (the prewetting problem). In 1996, Cesi and Martinelli showed that if the inverse-temperature $\beta$ is large enough, then along a decreasing sequence of critical points $(\lambda_c^{(k)})_{k=0}^{K_\beta}$ the dynamics is torpid: its inverse spectral gap is $O(1)$ when $\lambda \in (\lambda_c^{(k+1)},\lambda_c^{(k)})$ whereas it is $\exp[\Theta(n)]$ at each $\lambda_c^{(k)}$ for each $k\leq K_\beta$, due to a coexistence of rigid phases at heights $k+1$ and $k$. Our focus is understanding (a) the onset of metastability as $\lambda_n\uparrow\lambda_c^{(k)}$; and (b) the effect of an unbounded number of layers, as we remove the restriction $k\le K_\beta$, and even allow for $\lambda_n\to 0$ towards the $\lambda = 0$ case which has $O(\log n)$ layers and was studied by Caputo et al. (2014). We show that for any $k$, possibly growing with $n$, the inverse gap is $\exp[\tilde\Theta(1/|\lambda_n-\lambda_c^{(k)}|)]$ as $\lambda\uparrow \lambda_c^{(k)}$ up to distance $n^{-1+o(1)}$ from this critical point, due to a metastable layer at height $k$ on the way to forming the desired layer at height $k+1$. By taking $\lambda_n = n^{-\alpha}$ (corresponding to $k_n\asymp \log n$), this also interpolates down to the behavior of the dynamics when $\lambda =0$. We complement this by extending the fast mixing to all $\lambda$ uniformly bounded away from $(\lambda_c^{(k)})_{k=0}^\infty$. Together, these results provide a sharp understanding of the predicted infinite sequence of dynamical phase transitions governed by the layering phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-p Bounds via Cumulant-Based Edgeworth Expansion for $\alpha$-Mixing Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable recent progress in establishing normal approximation bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-$p$ distance for \emph{i.i.d.} or locally dependent random variables. However, for $p&gt;1$ no such result has previously been shown for the case of dependent variables with $\alpha$-mixing conditions. In this paper, we generalize the Wasserstein-$p$ bounds to work with $\alpha$-mixing random fields. We prove that under proper conditions the rescaled average over random fields can converge to the standard normal in the Wasserstein-$p$ distance at the rate of $\mathcal O(|T|^{-\beta})$, where $\lvert T\rvert$ is the size of the index set, and $\beta\in (0, 1/2]$ depends on $p$, the dimension $d$ of random fields, and the decay rate of the $\alpha$-mixing coefficients. In particular, $\beta=1/2$ can be achieved if the coefficients decay at a fast polynomial rate. Our results are obtained via a carefully constructed cumulant-based Edgeworth expansion and an adaptation of recent progress on Stein's method. Notably we propose a novel constructive graph approach that utilizes techniques in combinatorics to establish the desired expansion for general dependent variables.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a chemical reaction process, modeled as a multi-dimensional continuous-time jump process. Assume that at given times $0&lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt;t_n$, linear combinations $v_i = L_i X(t_i),\, i=1,\dots ,n$ are observed for given matrices $L_i$. We show how the process that is conditioned on hitting the states $v_1,\dots, v_n$ is obtained by a change of measure on the law of the unconditioned process. This results in an algorithm for obtaining weighted samples from the conditioned process. Our results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the count of subgraphs with an arbitrary configuration of endpoints in the random-connection model based on a Poisson point process on ${\Bbb R}^d$. We present combinatorial expressions for the computation of the cumulants and moments of all orders of such subgraph counts, which allow us to estimate the growth of cumulants as the intensity of the underlying Poisson point process goes to infinity. As a consequence, we obtain a central limit theorem with explicit convergence rates under the Kolmogorov distance, and connectivity bounds. Numerical examples are presented using a computer code in SageMath for the closed-form computation of cumulants of any order, for any type of connected subgraph and for any configuration of endpoints in any dimension $d\geq 1$. In particular, graph connectivity estimates, Gram-Charlier expansions for density estimation, and correlation estimates for joint subgraph counting are obtained.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{B}(t)=(B_1(t), B_2(t))$, $t\geq 0$ be a two-dimensional Brownian motion with independent components and define the $\mathbf{\gamma}$-reflected process $$\mathbf{X}(t)=(X_1(t),X_2(t))=\left(B_1(t)-c_1t-\gamma_1\inf_{s_1\in[0,t]}(B_1(s_1)-c_1s_1),B_2(t)-c_2t-\gamma_2\inf_{s_2\in[0,t]}(B_2(s_2)-c_2s_2)\right),$$ with given finite constants $c_1,c_2$ and $\gamma_1,\gamma_2\in[0,2)$. The goal of this paper is to derive the asymptotics of the ruin probability $$\mathbb{P}\{\exists_{t\in[0,T]}: X_1(t)&gt;u,X_2(t)&gt;au\}$$ as $u\to\infty$ and $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Birthday problem is a well-known classic problem in probability theory widely applied in cryptography, and bubble sort is a popular sorting algorithm leading to some interesting theoretical problems in computer science. However, the relation between bubble sort and birthday problem has not been discovered. By relating bubble sort to birthday problem, based on a generalization of Poisson limit theorem for dissociated random variables, this paper offers an intuitive explanation to naturally indicate that $\displaystyle \frac{n - P_{n}}{\sqrt{n}}$ converges in distribution to the standard Rayleigh distribution, where $P_{n}$ is the number of passes required to bubble sort $n$ distinct elements. Then asymptotic distributions and statistical characteristics of bubble sort and birthday problem are presented. Moreover, this paper discovers that some common optimizations of bubble sort could lead to average performance degradation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for a class of $ d $-dimensional $ G $-Brownian motions, we introduce $ G $-Bessel processes. Under the condition of dimensionality $ d $, we obtain that the $ G $-Bessel process is the solution of a stochastic differential equation. Moreover, under the more strict condition of dimensionality $ d $, we get the uniqueness of the solution of stochastic differential equations governing $ G $-Bessel processes and the nonattainability of the origin of $ G $-Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the low temperature $(2+1)$D SOS interface above a hard floor with critical pinning potential $\lambda_w= \log (\frac{1}{1-e^{-4\beta}})$. At $\lambda&lt;\lambda_w$ entropic repulsion causes the surface to delocalize and be rigid at height $\frac1{4\beta}\log n+O(1)$; at $\lambda&gt;\lambda_w$ it is localized at some $O(1)$ height. We show that at $\lambda=\lambda_w$, there is delocalization, with rigidity now at height $\lfloor \frac1{6\beta}\log n+\frac13\rfloor$, confirming a conjecture of Lacoin.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random walk in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of the random walk jumping from site $x$ to site $x+1$ and vice versa. Writing $r^{(N)}(x, x+1) := 1/c^{(N)}(x, x+1)$, under the assumption \begin{equation*}

Abstract: The spread of influence on social networks can be modeled by the activation of vertices in a random graph model. Each edge is associated with a probability of an activated vertex activating its neighbor in each update. When the probability associated with each edge does not depend on direction, a natural question is, does this local symmetry indicate a global symmetry, i.e. the influence of any pair of vertices on each other is symmetric after arbitrary time. We define a simple criterion to capture this global symmetry, and prove that this criterion is met with a method based on random matrices.</description>

Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider probability measures on infinite sequences over two countable alphabets of a different cardinality. We introduce an invertible mapping between such measures, called the normalized transport, that preserves both stationarity and ergodicity. The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport arises, for instance, in the problem of successive recurrence times. In particular, we show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which strengthens a result by Chen Moy from 1959.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of both the objective function and the norm of the gradient with SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Rectified deep neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of gradient-dependent semilinear heat equations</title>

Abstract: Numerical experiments indicate that deep learning algorithms overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating solutions of semilinear PDEs. For certain linear PDEs and semilinear PDEs with gradient-independent nonlinearities this has also been proved mathematically, i.e., it has been shown that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN increases at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. The main contribution of this paper is to rigorously prove for the first time that deep neural networks can also overcome the curse dimensionality in the approximation of a certain class of nonlinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of random scan Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference under log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference scheme is a popular algorithm used to compute the mean-field approximation of a probability distribution of interest. We analyze its random scan version, under log-concavity assumptions on the target density. Our approach builds on the recent work of M. Arnese and D. Lacker, \emph{Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport} [arXiv:2404.08792] which studies the deterministic scan version of the algorithm, phrasing it as a block-coordinate descent algorithm in the space of probability distributions endowed with the geometry of optimal transport. We obtain tight rates for the random scan version, which imply that the total number of factor updates required to converge scales linearly with the condition number and the number of blocks of the target distribution. By contrast, available bounds for the deterministic scan case scale quadratically in the same quantities, which is analogue to what happens for optimization of convex functions in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05733</link>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design a novel recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.
  We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.</description>

Abstract: We correct errors that appear throughout "The vicious neighbour problem" by Tao and Wu.
  We seek to solve the following problem. Suppose $N$ nerds are distributed uniformly at random in a square region. At 3:14pm, every nerd simultaneously snipes their nearest neighbor. What is the expected proportion $P_N$ of nerds who are left unscathed in the limit as $N\to\infty$?</description>

      <title>Jump Restore Light Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both local exploration of the state space and global discovery of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for adjusting an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>
