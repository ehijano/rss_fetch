      <title>Promotional Language and the Adoption of Innovative Ideas in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How are the merits of innovative ideas communicated in science? Here we conduct semantic analyses of grant application success with a focus on scientific promotional language, which has been growing in frequency in many contexts and purportedly may convey an innovative idea's originality and significance. Our analysis attempts to surmount limitations of prior studies by examining the full text of tens of thousands of both funded and unfunded grants from three leading public and private funding agencies: the NIH, the NSF, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, one of the world's largest private science foundations. We find a robust association between promotional language and the support and adoption of innovative ideas by funders and other scientists. First, the percentage of promotional language in a grant proposal is associated with up to a doubling of the grant's probability of being funded. Second, a grant's promotional language reflects its intrinsic level of innovativeness. Third, the percentage of promotional language predicts the expected citation and productivity impact of publications that are supported by funded grants. Lastly, a computer-assisted experiment that manipulates the promotional language in our data demonstrates how promotional language can communicate the merit of ideas through cognitive activation. With the incidence of promotional language in science steeply rising, and the pivotal role of grants in converting promising and aspirational ideas into solutions, our analysis provides empirical evidence that promotional language is associated with effectively communicating the merits of innovative scientific ideas.</description>

      <title>Automatically detecting scientific political science texts from a large general document index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report outlines the filtering approach applied to the collection of the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) data to extract articles from the political science domain. We combined hard and soft filters to address entries with different available metadata, e.g. title, abstract or keywords. The hard filter is a weighted keyword-based filter approach. The soft filter uses a multilingual BERT-based classification model, trained to detect scientific articles from the political science domain. We evaluated both approaches using an annotated dataset, consisting of scientific articles from different scientific domains. The weighted keyword-based approach achieved the highest total accuracy of 0.88. The multilingual BERT-based classification model was fine-tuned using a dataset of 14,178 abstracts from scientific articles and reached the highest total accuracy of 0.98.</description>

      <title>The Vertebrate Breed Ontology: Towards Effective Breed Data Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Limited universally adopted data standards in veterinary science hinders data interoperability and therefore integration and comparison; this ultimately impedes application of existing information-based tools to support advancement in veterinary diagnostics, treatments, and precision medicine.
  Objectives: Creation of a Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO) as a single, coherent logic-based standard for documenting breed names in animal health, production and research-related records will improve data use capabilities in veterinary and comparative medicine.
  Animals: No live animals were used in this study.
  Methods: A list of breed names and related information was compiled from relevant sources, organizations, communities, and experts using manual and computational approaches to create VBO. Each breed is represented by a VBO term that includes all provenance and the breed's related information as metadata. VBO terms are classified using description logic to allow computational applications and Artificial Intelligence-readiness.
  Results: VBO is an open, community-driven ontology representing over 19,000 livestock and companion animal breeds covering 41 species. Breeds are classified based on community and expert conventions (e.g., horse breed, cattle breed). This classification is supported by relations to the breeds' genus and species indicated by NCBI Taxonomy terms. Relationships between VBO terms, e.g. relating breeds to their foundation stock, provide additional context to support advanced data analytics. VBO term metadata includes common names and synonyms, breed identifiers or codes, and attributed cross-references to other databases.
  Conclusion and clinical importance: Veterinary data interoperability and computability can be enhanced by the adoption of VBO as a source of standard breed names in databases and veterinary electronic health records.</description>

      <title>Relational hyperevent models for the coevolution of coauthoring and citation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of suitable statistical models for the analysis of bibliographic networks has trailed behind the empirical ambitions expressed by recent studies of science of science. Extant research typically restricts the analytical focus to either paper citation networks, or author collaboration networks. These networks involve not only direct relationships between papers or authors, but also a broader system of dependencies between the references of papers connected through multiple simultaneous citation links. In this work, we extend recently developed relational hyperevent models (RHEM) to analyze scientific networks - systems of scientific publications connected by citations and authorship. We introduce new covariates that represent theoretically relevant and empirically meaningful sub-network configurations. The new model specification supports testing of hypotheses that align with the polyadic nature of scientific publication events and the multiple interdependencies between authors and references of current and prior papers. We implement the model using open-source software to analyze a large, publicly available scientific network dataset. A significant finding of the study is the tendency for subsets of papers to be repeatedly cited together across publications. This result is crucial as it suggests that the papers' impact may be partly due to endogenous network processes. More broadly, the study shows that models accounting for both the hyperedge structure of publication events and the interconnections between authors and references significantly enhance our understanding of the network mechanisms that drive scientific production, productivity, and impact.</description>
