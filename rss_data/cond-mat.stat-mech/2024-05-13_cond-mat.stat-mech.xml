      <title>Entropy production of the contact model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an expression for the production of entropy for system described by a stochastic dynamics which is appropriate for the case where the reverse transition rate vanishes but the forward transition is nonzero. The expression is positive defined and based on the inequality $x\ln x-(x-1)\ge0$. The corresponding entropy flux is linear in the probability distribution allowing its calculation as an average. The expression is applied to the one-dimensional contact process at the stationary state. We found that the rate of entropy production per site is finite with a singularity at the critical point with diverging slope.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. It means that when a system's state is perturbed, it is still affected by the perturbation at a later time. Here, we show that such a memory effect is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the system's degrees of freedom. In addition, such a LRO phase is non-perturbative and attractive to the system, but its existence does not necessarily imply criticality. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</description>

      <title>XY model on a self-avoiding walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a lattice model of a magnetic polymer where the XY spin variables are located on a self-avoiding walk (SAW) on a regular lattice in two and three dimensions. We consider the regime where both spins and conformations are dynamic, thus the XY model is defined on a dynamic lattice and conformations generate an annealed disorder. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the globule-coil and ferromagnetic phase transitions, and pay special attention to the vicinity of the theta-point. Our numerical results suggest that the transitions are continuous in two dimensions and first-order in three dimensions, which is similar to related models with Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in statistics of the local time and occupation time for a run and tumble particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the local time $\mathcal{T} = \int_0^T \delta(x(t)) dt$ that a run and tumble particle (RTP) $x(t)$ in one dimension spends at the origin, with or without an external drift. By relating the local time to the number of times the RTP crosses the origin, we find that the local time distribution $P(\mathcal{T})$ satisfies the large deviation principle $P(\mathcal{T}) \sim \, e^{-T \, I(\mathcal{T} / T)} $ in the large observation time limit $T \to \infty$. Remarkably, we find that in presence of drift the rate function $I(\rho)$ is nonanalytic: We interpret its singularity as dynamical phase transitions of first order. We then extend these results by studying the statistics of the amount of time $\mathcal{R}$ that the RTP spends inside a finite interval (i.e., the occupation time), with qualitatively similar results. In particular, this yields the long-time decay rate of the probability $P(\mathcal{R} = T)$ that the particle does not exit the interval up to time $T$. We find that the conditional endpoint distribution exhibits an interesting change of behavior from unimodal to bimodal as a function of the size of the interval. To study the occupation time statistics, we extend the Donsker-Varadhan large-deviation formalism to the case of RTPs, for general dynamical observables and possibly in the presence of an external potential.</description>

      <title>Bifractality in one-dimensional Wolf-Villain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multifractal optimal detrended fluctuation analysis to study the scaling properties of the one-dimensional Wolf-Villain (WV) model for surface growth. This model produces mounded surface morphologies for long time scales (up to $10^9$ monolayers) and its universality class remains controversial. Our results for the multifractal exponent $\tau(q)$ reveal an effective local roughness exponent consistent with a transient given by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth regime and Edward-Wilkinson (EW) universality class for negative and positive $q$-values, respectively. Therefore, although the results corroborate that long-wavelength fluctuations belong to the EW class in the hydrodynamic limit, as conjectured in the recent literature, a bifractal signature of the WV model with an MBE regime at short wavelengths was observed.</description>

      <title>Influence of initial correlations on evolution over time of an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to accounting for the influence of initial system-bath correlations on the dynamics of an open quantum system, based on the conventional projection operator technique, is suggested. To avoid the difficulties of treating the initial correlations, the conventional Nakajima-Zwanzig inhomogeneous generalized master equations (GMEs) for a system's reduced statistical operator and correlation function are exactly converted into the homogeneous GMEs (HGMEs), which take into account the initial correlations in the kernel governing the evolution of these HGMEs. In the second order (Born) approximation in the system-bath interaction, the obtained HGMEs are local in time and valid at all timescales. They are further specialized for a realistic equilibrium Gibbs initial (at $t=t_0$) system+bath state (for a system reduced statistical operator an external force at $t&gt;t_0$ is applied) and then for a bath of oscillators (Boson field). As an example, the evolution of a selected quantum oscillator (a localized mode) interacting with a Boson field (Fano-like model) is considered at different timescales. It is shown explicitly how the initial correlations influence the oscillator evolution process. In particular, it is shown that the equilibrium system's correlation function acquires at the large timescale the additional constant phase factor conditioned by survived initial system-bath correlations.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Roots of $\kappa$-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axiomatic structure of the $\kappa$-statistcal theory is proven. In addition to the first three standard Khinchin--Shannon axioms of continuity, maximality, and expansibility, two further axioms are identified, namely the self-duality axiom and the scaling axiom. It is shown that both the $\kappa$-entropy and its special limiting case, the classical Boltzmann--Gibbs--Shannon entropy, follow unambiguously from the above new set of five axioms. It has been emphasized that the statistical theory that can be built from $\kappa$-entropy has a validity that goes beyond physics and can be used to treat physical, natural, or artificial complex systems. The physical origin of the self-duality and scaling axioms has been investigated and traced back to the first principles of relativistic physics, i.e., the Galileo relativity principle and the Einstein principle of the constancy of the speed of light. It has been shown that the $\kappa$-formalism, which emerges from the $\kappa$-entropy, can treat both simple (few-body) and complex (statistical) systems in a unified way. Relativistic statistical mechanics based on $\kappa$-entropy is shown that preserves the main features of classical statistical mechanics (kinetic theory, molecular chaos hypothesis, maximum entropy principle, thermodynamic stability, H-theorem, and Lesche stability). The answers that the $\kappa$-statistical theory gives to the more-than-a-century-old open problems of relativistic physics, such as how thermodynamic quantities like temperature and entropy vary with the speed of the reference frame, have been emphasized.</description>

      <title>Predicting State Transitions in Autonomous Nonlinear Bistable Systems with Hidden Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistable autonomous systems can be found inmany areas of science. When the intrinsic noise intensity is large, these systems exhibits stochastic transitions from onemetastable steady state to another. In electronic bistable memories, these transitions are failures, usually simulated in a Monte-Carlo fashion at a high CPU-time price. Existing closed-form formulas, relying on near-stable-steady-state approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics to estimate the mean transition time, have turned out inaccurate. Our contribution is twofold. From a unidimensional stochastic model of overdamped autonomous systems, we propose an extended Eyring-Kramers analytical formula accounting for both nonlinear drift and state-dependent white noise variance, rigorously derived from It\^o stochastic calculus. We also adapt it to practical system engineering situations where the intrinsic noise sources are hidden and can only be inferred from the fluctuations of observables measured in steady states. First numerical trials on an industrial electronic case study suggest that our approximate prediction formula achieve remarkable accuracy, outperforming previous non-Monte-Carlo approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ renewal processes to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active Brownian particle under stochastic orientational resetting. By computing the experimentally accessible intermediate scattering function (ISF) and reconstructing the full time-dependent distribution of the displacements, we study the interplay of rotational diffusion and resetting. The resetting process introduces a new spatiotemporal regime reflecting the directed motion of agents along the resetting direction at large length scales, which becomes apparent in an imaginary part of the ISF. We further derive analytical expressions for the low-order moments of the displacements and find that the variance displays an effective diffusive regime at long times, which decreases for increasing resetting rates. At intermediate times the dynamics are characterized by a negative skewness as well as a non-zero non-Gaussian parameter.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging contextual input information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation untanglement in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Steered Quantum Coherence and Magic Resource under Sudden Quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of l_1-norm of steered quantum coherence (SQC), steered quantum relative entropy (SQRE), and magic resource quantifier (QRM) in the one-dimensional XY spin chain in the presence of time dependent transverse magnetic field. We find that the system's response is highly sensitive to the initial state and magnetic field strength. % We show that the dynamics of SQC, SQRE and MRQ revealing the critical point associated with equilibrium quantum phase transition (QPT) of the system. All quantities show maximum at QPT when the initial state is prepared in the ferromagnetic phase. Conversely, they undergo abrupt changes at quantum critical point if the initial state of the system is paramagnetic. Moreover, our results confirm that, when quench is done to the quantum critical point, the first suppression (revival) time scales linearly with the system size, and remarkably, its scaling ratio remains consistent for all quenches, irrespective of the initial phase of the system. % These results highlight the interplay between the quantum information resources and dynamics of quantum systems away from the equilibrium. Such insights could be vital for quantum information processing and understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Oscillating-mode gap: an indicator of phase transition in open quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It presents a significant challenge to elucidate the relationship between the phases of open quantum many-body systems and the spectral structure of their governing Liouvillian, which determines how the density matrix evolves. Previous studies have focused on the Liouvillian gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying mode, as a key indicator of dissipative phase transition, noting its closure in symmetry-broken phases and opening in disordered phases. In this work, we propose an additional spectral gap, termed the oscillating-mode gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying oscillating mode. Through the analysis of a prototype dissipative boson system, we demonstrate the necessity of both the Liouvillian gap and the oscillating-mode gap for the comprehensive characterization of the system's phases and the transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Particle transport in open polygonal billiards: a scattering map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygonal billiards exhibit a rich and complex dynamical behavior. In recent years polygonal billiards have attracted great attention due to their application in the understanding of anomalous transport, but also at the fundamental level, due to its connections with diverse fields in mathematics. We explore this complexity and its consequences on the properties of particle transport in infinitely long channels made of the repetitions of an elementary open polygonal cell. Borrowing ideas from the Zemlyakov-Katok construction, we construct an interval exchange transformation classified by the singular directions of the discontinuities of the billiard flow over the translation surface associated to the elementary cell. From this, we derive an exact expression of a scattering map of the cell connecting the outgoing flow of trajectories with the unconstrained incoming flow. The scattering map is defined over a partition of the coordinate space, characterized by different families of trajectories. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the average speed of propagation of ballistic modes, describing with high accuracy the speed of propagation of ballistic fronts appearing in the tails of the distribution of the particle displacement. The symbolic hierarchy of the trajectories forming these ballistic fronts is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a lattice model to probe the effect of active self-disassembly on equilibrium self-assembly. Surprisingly, we find conditions under which active self-disassembly enhances the yield of a target structure above that achieved by self-assembly alone when the latter is already favoured thermodynamically.

      <title>Reducing segregation in vibrated binary-sized granular mixtures by excessive small particle introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine binary-sized granular mixtures confined between two parallel walls subjected to vertical vibration using the discrete element method. For a size ratio of $3$ between large and small particles, we study the structure of large particles in regions where the combined two-dimensional packing fractions of both particle sizes surpass $1$. When the fraction of small particles is small, segregation of the large particles appears. In contrast, as the fraction of small particles increases, an effective repulsion between the large particles emerges over distances greater than the large particle diameter, suppressing their segregation. Further, this effective repulsion also induces a hexagonal phase of the large particles at packing fractions lower than in mono-component systems. This work will provide a fresh insight into granular physics, prompting further experimental and theoretical study.</description>

      <title>Orientational dynamics governs the pathways of entropic crystallization of Brownian squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles with anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier since directional entropic forces often cause fascinating variations in the equilibrium crystal structures. At increasing densities, when the orientational excluded volumes of anisotropic particles start overlapping, their translational and rotational dynamics become coupled, introducing complexities in the kinetics of their configurational reorganization, which facilitates ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets, which are known to equilibrate into hexagonal and rhombic crystalline phases as the osmotic pressure is increased. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and calculating their corresponding contributions to minimize the free energy, we have shown that the accessible range of orientational diffusion of particles governs the pathways of structural evolution and consequent optimal equilibrium ordering at a given osmotic pressure. As the accessible orientational excursion becomes wider, the rotational contribution to configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of side-aligned particles with restricted rotational diffusion maximize entropy, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. Intriguingly, the density, which solely governs the crystallization of hard spheres, does not have any direct effect on this process. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations further corroborate these experimental observations and interpretations. Our findings are also relevant to other systems of hard interacting anisotropic shapes in two and three dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of annealed disorder on the mechanical properties and plasticity of a modeled amorphous solid by introducing a small fraction of heavy impurities into the material which resembles real experimental systems. The disorder being mobile, the total degrees of freedom and the potential energy landscape of the pure system are preserved in our model. The mechanical failure and the shear band formation in the amorphous solid in the presence of annealed disorder are studied at the microscopic level by employing the finite shear deformation protocol at nonzero temperature. A significant enhancement in the shear modulus and yield stress is observed as a function of the heaviness of the impurity particles. Via the analysis of the non-affine displacement field and the microscopic strain fluctuations and the nature of their spatial correlations we find that the shear band formation in the plastic regime is gradually suppressed with increasing impurity mass. Eventually, a critical mass of the disordered particles is identified above which the plastic events become completely localized. This is marked by a transition from a power law to an exponential decay in the spatial correlations non-affine displacement field. Likewise, a similar change is observed in the strain correlation function, transitioning from a slower $1/r$ decay to a more rapid $1/r^3$ decay. Finally, the effect shear rate on the plastic events in the presence of annealed disorder is explored.</description>

      <title>A replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of hardspheres with continuous polydispersity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy soft matter is often continuously polydisperse, in which the sizes or various properties of the constituent particles are distributed continuously. However, most of the microscopic theories of the glass transition focus on the monodisperse particles. Here, we developed a replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of continuously polydisperse hardspheres. We focused on the limit of infinite spatial dimension, where replica theory becomes exact. In theory, the cage size $A$, which plays the role of an order parameter, appears to depend on the particle size $\sigma$, and thus, the effective free energy, the so-called Franz-Parisi potential, is a functional of $A(\sigma)$. We applied this theory to two fundamental systems: a nearly monodisperse system and an exponential distribution system. We found that dynamic decoupling occurs in both cases; the critical particle size $\sigma^{\ast}$ emerges, and larger particles with $\sigma \geq \sigma^{\ast}$ vitrify, while smaller particles $\sigma &lt; \sigma^{\ast}$ remain mobile. Moreover, the cage size $A(\sigma)$ exhibits a critical behavior at $\sigma \simeq \sigma^{\ast}$, originating from spinodal instability of $\sigma^{\ast}$-sized particles. We discuss the implications of these results for finite dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Its Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Except for crystalline or random structures, an agreed definition of complexity for intermediate and hence interesting cases does not exist. We fill this gap with a notion of complexity that characterises shapes formed by any finite number of particles greater than or equal to the three needed to define triangle shapes. The resulting shape complexity is a simple scale-invariant quantity that measures the extent to which a collection of particles has a uniform or clustered distribution. As a positive-definite number with an absolute minimum realised on the most uniform distribution the particles can have, it not only characterises all physical structures from crystals to the most complex that can exist but also determines for them a measure that makes richly structured shapes more probable than bland ones. Strikingly, the criterion employed to define the shape complexity forces it to be the product of the two functions that define Newtonian universal gravitation. This suggests both the form and solutions the law of a universe of such particles should have and leads to a theory that not only determines the complexity and probability of any individual shape but also its creation from the maximally uniform shape. It does this moreover in a manner which makes it probable that the cosmological principle, according to which on a sufficiently large scale the universe should have the same appearance everywhere, holds. Our theory relies on universal group-theoretical principles that may allow generalisation to include all forces and general relativity.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Langevin dynamics of rigid inclusions on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a rigid inclusion constrained to move on a curved surface has many applications in biological and soft matter physics, ranging from the diffusion of passive or active membrane proteins to the motion of phoretic particles on liquid-liquid interfaces. Here we construct intrinsic Langevin equations for an oriented rigid inclusion on a curved surface using Cartan's method of moving frames. We first derive the Hamiltonian equations of motion for the translational and rotational momenta in the body frame. Surprisingly, surface curvature couples the linear and angular momenta of the inclusion. We then add to the Hamiltonian equations linear friction, white noise and arbitrary configuration-dependent forces and torques to obtain intrinsic Langevin equations of motion in phase space. We provide the integrability conditions, made non-trivial by surface curvature, for the forces and torques to admit a potential, thus distinguishing between passive and active stochastic motion. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in geometric form and obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations that ensure Gibbsian equilibrium. We extract the overdamped equations of motion by adiabatically eliminating the momenta from the Fokker-Planck equation, showing how a peculiar cancellation leads to the naively expected Smoluchowski limit. The overdamped equations can be used for accurate and efficient intrinsic Brownian dynamics simulations of passive, driven and active diffusion processes on curved surfaces. Our work generalises to the collective dynamics of many inclusions on curved surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the dependence of range of attractive potential on the phase separation of 2-D binary systems. Through extensive simulations and analysis, we show that when the range of attractive interactions approaches the sticky sphere limit, the system undergoes a phase separation at lower temperature. Further reduction in temperature causes the system to mix again. These mixing-demixing-mixing transitions are of first order. Such phase separation is not observed for systems with larger interaction range. In the phase separated region of the phase diagram, one of the components of the mixture chooses to be in crystalline configuration, while other being in disordered state</description>

Abstract: This dissertation explores quantum computation using qudits encoded into large spins, emphasizing the concept of quantum co-design to harness the unique capabilities of physical platforms for enhanced quantum information processing. First, we delve into the generation of high-fidelity universal gate sets for quantum computation with qudits. Leveraging principles from quantum optimal control, Rydberg physics, and the atomic structure of alkaline-earth atoms, we propose protocols for high-fidelity universal gate sets in the ground state of 87Sr with reasonable experimental parameters. Next, we analyze schemes to encode a qubit in the large spin qudits for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). By comprehending the most dominant noise in the physical system, we develop FTQC protocols that outperform the standard protocols. Finally, considering spin qudits for neutral atom quantum computation, we studied protocols for converting leakage errors to erasure errors resource efficiently. Also, we developed cooling methods for neutral atoms without destroying the quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum integrable system slightly perturbed away from integrability is typically expected to thermalize on timescales of order $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength. We here study classes of perturbations that violate this scaling, and exhibit much longer thermalization times $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2\ell}$ where $\ell&gt;1$ is an integer. Systems with these "weak integrability breaking" perturbations have an extensive number of quasi-conserved quantities that commute with the perturbed Hamiltonian up to corrections of order $\lambda^\ell$. We demonstrate a systematic construction to obtain families of such weak perturbations of a generic integrable model for arbitrary $\ell$. We then apply the construction to various models, including the Heisenberg, XXZ, and XYZ chains, the Hubbard model, models of spinless free fermions, and the quantum Ising chain. Our analytical framework explains the previously observed evidence of weak integrability breaking in the Heisenberg and XXZ chains under certain perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable models are characterized by the existence of stable excitations that can propagate indefinitely without decaying. This includes multi-magnon bound states in the celebrated XXZ spin chain model and its integrable Floquet counterpart. A recent Google Quantum AI experiment [A. Morvan et al., Nature 612, 240 (2022)] realizing the Floquet model demonstrated the persistence of such collective excitations even when the integrability is broken: this observation is at odds with the expectation of ergodic dynamics in generic non-integrable systems. We here study the spectrum of the model realized in the experiment using exact diagonalization and physical arguments. We find that isolated bands corresponding to the descendants of the exact bound states of the integrable model are clearly observable in the spectrum for a large range of system sizes. However, our numerical analysis of the localization properties of the eigenstates suggests that the bound states become unstable in the thermodynamic limit. A perturbative estimate of the decay rate agrees with the prediction of an eventual instability for large system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of molecular-scale enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.</description>

Abstract: Organisms maintain the status quo, holding key physiological variables constant to within an acceptable tolerance, and yet adapt with precision and plasticity to dynamic changes in externalities. What organizational principles ensure such exquisite yet robust control of systems-level "state variables" in complex systems with an extraordinary number of moving parts and fluctuating variables? Here we focus on these issues in the specific context of intra- and intergenerational life histories of individual bacterial cells, whose biographies are precisely charted via high-precision dynamic experiments using the SChemostat technology. We highlight intra- and intergenerational scaling laws and other "emergent simplicities" revealed by these high-precision data. In turn, these facilitate a principled route to dimensional reduction of the problem, and serve as essential building blocks for phenomenological and mechanistic theory. Parameter-free data-theory matches for multiple organisms validate theory frameworks, and explicate the systems physics of stochastic homeostasis and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinants and "anomalous contributions'' in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics allow simple explicit representations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate ``anomalous contributions'' in the re-scaled correlators.</description>

Abstract: Two of the most influential exact results in classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are about current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundary, and in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. This result is obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach of macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. Our exact result enables us to address the corresponding problem on an infinite line in the presence of a slow bond and several related problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02982v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Markov jump process on a general state space to which we apply a time-dependent weak perturbation over a finite time interval. By martingale-based stochastic calculus, under a suitable exponential moment bound for the perturbation we show that the perturbed process does not explode almost surely and we study the linear response (LR) of observables and additive functionals. When the unperturbed process is stationary, the above LR formulas become computable in terms of the steady state two-time correlation function and of the stationary distribution. Applications are discussed for birth and death processes, random walks in a confining potential, random walks in a random conductance field. We then move to a Markov jump process on a finite state space and investigate the LR of observables and additive functionals in the oscillatory steady state (hence, over an infinite time horizon), when the perturbation is time-periodic. As an application we provide a formula for the complex mobility matrix of a random walk on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus, with possibly heterogeneous jump rates.</description>

Abstract: The correlation function in quantum systems plays a vital role in decoding their properties and gaining insights into physical phenomena. Its interpretation corresponds to the propagation of particle excitations between space-time, similar in spirit to the idea of quantum weak measurement in terms of recording the system information by interaction. By defining weak-valued correlation function, we propose the basic insights and the universal methods for recording them on the apparatus through weak measurement. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform numerical experiments of perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators, addressing the intricate interplay between the coupling strength and the number of ensemble copies. Additionally, we extend our protocol to the domain of quantum field theory, where joint weak values encode crucial information about the correlation function. Hopefully, this comprehensive investigation can advance our understanding of the fundamental nature of the correlation function and weak measurement in quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Ordered States in Heisenberg Pyrochlore Antiferromagnets with Dipole-Dipole Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Heisenberg model with both a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction and long-range dipole-dipole interactions is investigated by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation. The ground state of the model without the dipole-dipole interactions is known to be a classical spin liquid and the system does not order at all temperature because of strong frustration. On the other hand, the ordered state of the model with weak dipolar interactions is known to be the so-called Palmer-Chalker (PC) state, in which a pair of spins and another pair of spins are antiparallel and the former is perpendicular to the latter for each tetrahedron of the lattice. Here ordered states of the model are obtained for various values of the relative strength of the two kinds of the interactions. Besides the spin liquid state and the PC-like state, states that might be considered as glassy state, states of period 8, states of period 4, and states of period of 4 on one sublattice and 8 on other three sublattices are realized. Among the states with period 4 or (and) 8, multi-{\bf K} structures are observed.</description>

      <title>Stable-fixed-point description of square-pattern formation in driven two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) caused by periodic driving of the interatomic interaction. We show that this modulation generically leads to a stable square grid density pattern, due to nonlinear effects beyond the initial Faraday instability. We take the amplitudes of two waves parametrizing the two-dimensional density pattern as order parameters in pattern formation. For these amplitudes, we derive a set of coupled time evolution equations from the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a time-periodic interaction. We identify the fixed points of the time evolution and show by stability analysis that the inhomogeneous density exhibits a square grid pattern, which can be understood as a manifestation of a stable fixed point. Our stability analysis establishes the pattern in BECs as a nonequilibrium steady state.</description>

      <title>Approximate t-designs in generic circuit architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary t-designs are distributions on the unitary group whose first t moments appear maximally random. Previous work has established several upper bounds on the depths at which certain specific random quantum circuit ensembles approximate t-designs. Here we show that these bounds can be extended to any fixed architecture of Haar-random two-site gates. This is accomplished by relating the spectral gaps of such architectures to those of 1D brickwork architectures. Our bound depends on the details of the architecture only via the typical number of layers needed for a block of the circuit to form a connected graph over the sites. When this quantity is independent of width, the circuit forms an approximate t-design in linear depth. We also give an implicit bound for nondeterministic architectures in terms of properties of the corresponding distribution over fixed architectures.</description>

      <title>Phi4tools: Compilation of Feynman diagrams for Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar field theories with quartic interactions are of central interest in the study of second-order phase transitions. For three-dimensional theories, numerous studies make use of the fixed-dimensional perturbative computation of [B. Nickel, D. Meiron, and G. Baker Jr, Compilation of 2-pt and 4-pt graphs for continuous spin model, University of Guelph report (1977)], unfortunately left unpublished. We independently verify the results of Nickel et al., and we extend the computation to the eighth order in the coupling constant. The results of our calculations, together with the tools developed, are made available in Phi4tools, a user-friendly package that allows displaying the information about the individual Feynman diagrams, including the numerical values for the diagrams for zero, two, and four-point functions. We also provide the perturbative series up to order eight for the renormalization-group functions for the $O(N)$ and cubic anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>The inverse Mpemba effect demonstrated on a single trapped ion qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counter-intuitive phenomena in which a hot system reaches a cold temperature faster than a colder system, under otherwise identical conditions. Here we propose a quantum analog of the Mpemba effect, on the simplest quantum system, a qubit. Specifically, we show it exhibits an inverse effect, in which a cold qubit reaches a hot temperature faster than a hot qubit. Furthermore, in our system a cold qubit can heat up exponentially faster, manifesting the strong version of the effect. This occurs only for sufficiently coherent systems, making this effect quantum mechanical, i.e. due to interference effects. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a single $^{88}\text{Sr}^+$ trapped ion qubit. The existence of this anomalous relaxation effect in simple quantum systems reveals its fundamentality, and may have a role in designing and operating quantum information processing devices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several enzymes exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of a substrate. One explanation of this enhancement arises from fluctuating dimer models, which suggest that enzymes have a higher diffusion constant when interacting with substrates compared to when they are free. Another possible mechanism, suggested in both experimental and theoretical studies, is that enzymes act as nanoswimmers. However, existing nanoswimmer models have struggled to account for the exceptionally high self-propulsion speeds observed in experiments, with estimated increases in diffusion due to self-propulsion found to be minimal. In this study, we model enzymes as dimers with fluctuating mobility. We show that even dimers can exhibit run-and-tumble motion when transitioning between states of varying mobility within the enzymatic cycle. By exploring a three-state enzymatic cycle, we identify the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds and increases in diffusion rate consistent with experimental observations can be achieved.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Calculations using Smooth Basin Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonians in the Modulated Momenta of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the quantum East-West kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>Intermediate spectral statistics of rational triangular quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triangular billiards whose angles are rational multiples of $\pi$ are one of the simplest examples of pseudo-integrable models with intriguing classical and quantum properties. We perform an extensive numerical study of spectral statistics of eight quantized rational triangles, six belonging to the family of right-angled Veech triangles and two obtuse rational triangles. Large spectral samples of up to one million energy levels were calculated for each triangle which permits to determine their spectral statistics with great accuracy. It is demonstrated that they are of the intermediate type, sharing some features with chaotic systems, like level repulsion and some with integrable systems, like exponential tails of the level spacing distributions. Another distinctive feature of intermediate spectral statistics is a finite value of the level compressibility.
  The short range statistics such as the level spacing distributions, and long-range statistics such as the number variance and spectral form factors were analyzed in detail. An excellent agreement between the numerical data and the model of gamma distributions is revealed.</description>
