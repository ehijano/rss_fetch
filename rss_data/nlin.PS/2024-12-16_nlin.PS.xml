      <title>Observation of edge solitons and their phase transition in a trimer circuit lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons emerge either as bifurcations of linear topological edge states or as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. Although electrical circuits have proven to be a versatile platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observing edge solitons and their phase transition in circuit lattices remains challenging. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear electrical circuits and experimentally demonstrate the existence of both topological and nontopological edge solitons in a trimer circuit lattice, as well as the phase transition between these two types of edge solitons. Under weak nonlinearity, we observe antisymmetric and symmetric edge solitons bifurcating from their respective linear topological edge states. In contrast, under strong nonlinearity, nontopological edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric internal structures are discovered. Our work paves the way for exploring exotic nonlinear states and novel phase diagrams in nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>Exotic Coherent Structures and Their Collisional Dynamics in a (3+1) dimensional Bogoyavlensky-Konopelchenko Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the (3+1) dimensional Bogoyavlensky - Konopelchenko equation. Using Painlev\'e Truncation approach, we have constructed solutions in terms of lower dimensional arbitrary functions of space and time. By suitably harnessing the arbitrary functions present in the solution, we have generated physically interesting solutions like periodic solutions, kinks, linear rogue waves, line lumps, dipole lumps and hybrid dromions. It is interesting to note that unlike in (2+1) dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations, the line lumps interact and undergo elastic collision without exchange of energy which is confirmed by the asymptotic analysis. The hybrid dromions are also found to retain their amplitudes during interaction undergoing elastic collision. The highlight of the results is that one also observes the two nonparallel ghost solitons as well whose intersection gives rise to hybrid dromions, a phenomenon not witnessed in (2+1) dimensions.</description>
