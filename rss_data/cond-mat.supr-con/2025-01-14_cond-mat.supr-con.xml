      <title>Probing electric field tunable multiband superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system for exploring superconductivity. Here we investigate robust superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene, elucidating carrier contributions from both flat and dispersive bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. We disentangle the carrier density of Dirac bands and flat bands from the Landau fan diagram. Moreover, we could estimate the flatband Fermi velocity from the obtained high critical current near half filling when superconductivity is killed at finite magnetic fields, and further quantify the superfluid stiffness from the low critical current in the superconducting regime. Our results exhibit the electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional superconductivity in moire systems.</description>

      <title>High-pressure growth effect on the properties of high-Tc iron-based superconductors: A short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 {\deg}C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Effects of disorder on the quantum transport properties in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak antilocalization (WAL), an increase in the electrical conductivity at low temperatures associated with the suppression of electron localization due to quantum interference effects, is often observed in topological materials. In this study, we report the observation of WAL in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$ at low temperatures. In the pristine sample, we identified the presence of WAL, which is attributed to the topologically protected backscattering. In order to investigate the influence of disorder on the WAL, we successively introduced controlled amounts of disorder by H$^{+}$-irradiation. As disorder increases, the dip-like magnetoresistance caused by WAL changes to a linear magnetoresistance(MR), and eventually to a quadratic MR as the electronic system becomes highly localized. This research unveils the significance of disorder in shaping the quantum transport characteristics of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</description>

      <title>Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature ($\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$) superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system based on structural parameters integrating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements and ab initio calculations. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). The on-site Coulomb repulsive $\bm{U}$ and electron filling $\bm{n}$ dependencies of the correlated electronic structure are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) methods. The fermi surface topology is substantially changed by $\bm{U}$ around the cRPA value, suggesting the indispensable role of correlation effects. A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach, using $\bm{U=3.5}$ and $\bm{n = 1.3}$, yields a pronounced $\bm{s^{\pm}}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $\bm{d_{z^{2}}}$ characters. Our findings may explain the similar onset $\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$ comparing pressured bulks and strained thin films of the bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional superconductivity and superconducting diode effect induced by dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general principle of condensed matter physics prohibits the electric current in equilibrium. This prevents a zero-resistance state realized solely under a finite electric current, namely unidirectional superconductivity. In this paper, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.</description>

      <title>Preparation and readout of Majorana qubits in magnet-superconductor hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that even a weak out-of-plane attraction, V -&gt; 0, can form real-space pairs in the body-centered tetragonal lattice despite the presence of a Hubbard repulsion and a fully developed three-dimensional kinetic energy. In the hole channel, the pairs have d orbital symmetry which, following Bolgoliubov's argument, translates into a d-symmetric macroscopic superconducting order parameter. The findings help us to understand key features of La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and further support the real-space mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates. The rules of real-space superconductivity are formulated at the end.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in a model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave orders in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is evidence for competition between superconductivity and short-range charge-density wave order in a number of cuprate compounds and especially in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Here, we use a non-linear sigma model of such competition to study the effects of spatially correlated disorder in the chain layers and delta-correlated disorder in the CuO$_2$ layers. The first is relevant to the oxygen ortho structure and the latter may be induced by electron irradiation. We find that reducing the correlation length of the potential on the chain layers decreases the size of the charge-density wave structure factor but has little effect on its temperature dependence, as observed experimentally. At the same time, the charge-density wave correlation length decreases more than is seen in the experiment. The temperature at which the structure factor peaks coincides with $T_c$ and both decrease when disorder is introduced into the CuO$_2$ planes. Strengthening this disorder reduces the magnitude of the structure factor and eventually turns it into a monotonic function of the temperature. This occurs despite an increase in the local magnitude of the charge-density wave order.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Manipulation of Superconducting Properties via Ultrasonic Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.</description>

      <title>Stripe Antiferromagnetic Ground-State Configuration of FeSe Revealed by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic ground-state configuration of iron selenide FeSe has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting the stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. It is found that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground-state configuration with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. The present study underscores the importance of accurate XC functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground-state configuration of complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the N\'eel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</description>
