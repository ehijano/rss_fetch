      <title>TumorHoPe2: An updated database for Tumor Homing Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the growing need for organized data on tumor homing peptides (THPs), we present TumorHoPe2, a manually curated database offering extensive details on experimentally validated THPs. This represents a significant update to TumorHoPe, originally developed by our group in 2012. TumorHoPe2 now contains 1847 entries, representing 1297 unique tumor homing peptides, a substantial expansion from the 744 entries in its predecessor. For each peptide, the database provides critical information, including sequence, terminal or chemical modifications, corresponding cancer cell lines, and specific tumor types targeted. The database compiles data from two primary sources: phage display libraries, which are commonly used to identify peptide ligands targeting tumor-specific markers, and synthetic peptides, which are chemically modified to enhance properties such as stability, binding affinity, and specificity. Our dataset includes 594 chemically modified peptides, with 255 having N-terminal and 195 C-terminal modifications. These THPs have been validated against 172 cancer cell lines and demonstrate specificity for 37 distinct tumor types. To maximize utility for the research community, TumorHoPe2 is equipped with intuitive tools for data searching, filtering, and analysis, alongside a RESTful API for efficient programmatic access and integration into bioinformatics pipelines.

      <title>PDFBench: A Benchmark for De novo Protein Design from Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, while natural language processing and multimodal learning have seen rapid advancements, the field of de novo protein design has also experienced significant growth. However, most current methods rely on proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks: description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility, structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein design.</description>

      <title>Designing Cyclic Peptides via Harmonic SDE with Atom-Bond Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example, cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable stability and affinity.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Molecular Aggregation in Drug Discovery with Predictive Insights from Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein, we present the application of MEGAN, our explainable AI (xAI) model, for the identification of small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs). This work offers solutions to the long-standing problem of false positives caused by SCAMs in high throughput screening for drug discovery and demonstrates the power of xAI in the classification of molecular properties that are not chemically intuitive based on our current understanding. We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications. The integration of this method in high-throughput screening approaches will help combat and circumvent false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.</description>

      <title>Guide your favorite protein sequence generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models on sequences are transforming protein engineering. However, no principled framework exists for conditioning these models on auxiliary information, such as experimental data, in a plug-and-play manner. Herein, we present ProteinGuide -- a principled and general method for conditioning -- by unifying a broad class of protein generative models under a single framework. We demonstrate the applicability of ProteinGuide by guiding two protein generative models, ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences, conditioned on several user-specified properties such as enhanced stability, enzyme classes, and CATH-labeled folds. We also used ProteinGuide with inverse folding models and our own experimental assay to design adenine base editor sequences for high activity.</description>
