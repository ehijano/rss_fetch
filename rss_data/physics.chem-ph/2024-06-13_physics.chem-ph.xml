      <title>Role of Kinetic Exchange and Coulomb Interaction in Bonding of Hydrogen Molecular Systems and Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of hydrogen-based molecular systems (\ch{H2+}, \ch{H2}, \ch{H2-}) using the Exact Diagonalization Ab Initio (EDABI) approach within the framework of combined first- and second-quantization. By analyzing the relative contributions of kinetic exchange and effective Coulomb interactions, we provide a comprehensive understanding of covalency, atomicity, and ionicity as a function of interatomic distances. Our approach leverages exact solutions of the extended Heitler-London model to quantify these interactions, extending the analysis to the discussion of properties of excited states and the dissociation limit to these molecules. The findings reveal significant differences in bonding characteristics, particularly highlighting the stability and bonding nature of the neutral \ch{H2} molecule compared to its ionic counterparts. This study not only enhances an understanding of molecular interactions in hydrogen systems but also demonstrates the potential of the EDABI approach in developing more accurate computational models in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Making peace with random phases: Ab initio conical intersection dynamics in random gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of conical intersection dynamics is crucial for various photochemical, photophysical, and biological processes. However, adiabatic electronic states obtained from electronic structure computations involve random phases, or more generally, random gauge fixings, which hampers the modeling of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. Here we develop a random-gauge local diabatic representation that allows an exact modeling of conical intersection dynamics directly using the adiabatic electronic states with phases randomly assigned during the electronic structure computations. Its utility is demonstrated by an exact ab initio modeling of the two-dimensional Shin-Metiu model with and without an external magnetic field. Our results provide a simple approach to integrating the electronic structure computations into non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, thus paving the way for ab initio modeling of conical intersection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Interaction Between Thin Conducting Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state and excited state resonance dipole-dipole interaction energy between two elongated conducting molecules are explored. We review the current status for ground state interactions. This interaction is found to be of a much longer range than in the case when the molecules are pointlike and nonconducting. These are well known results found earlier by Davies, Ninham, and Richmond, and later, using a different formalism, by Rubio and co-workers. We show how the theory can be extended to excited state interactions. A characteristic property following from our calculation is that the interaction energy dependence with separation ($R$) goes like $f(R)/R^2$ both for resonance and for the van der Waals case in the long range limit. In some limits $f(R)$ has a logarithmic dependency and in others it takes constant values. We predict an unusual slow decay rate for the energy transfer between conducting molecules.</description>

      <title>Analytical evaluation of ground state gradients in quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical gradients of potential energy surfaces play a central role in quantum chemistry, allowing for molecular geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations. In strong coupling conditions, potential energy surfaces can account for strong interactions between matter and the quantized electromagnetic field. In this paper, we derive expressions for the ground state analytical gradients in quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster theory. We also present a Cholesky-based implementation for the coupled cluster singles and doubles model. We report timings to show the performance of the implementation and present optimized geometries to highlight cavity-induced molecular orientation effects in strong coupling conditions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting N$_2$ with Neural-Network-Supported CI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a recently proposed computational protocol for a neural-network-supported configuration interaction (NN CI) calculation to the paradigmatic N$_2$ molecule. By comparison of correlation energy, binding energy, and the full dissociation curve to experimental and full CI benchmarks, we demonstrate the applicability and robustness of our approach for the first time in the context of molecular systems, and offer thereby a new complementary tool in the family of machine-learning-based computation methods. The main advantage of the method lies in the efficiency of the neural-network-selected many-body basis set. Specifically, we approximate full CI results obtained on bases of $\approx 10^{10}$ Slater Determinants with only $\approx10^{5}$ determinants with good accuracy. The high efficiency of the NN CI approach underlines its potential for broader applications such as structural optimizations and even computation of spectroscopic observables in systems for which computational resources are a limiting factor.</description>

      <title>Measurement and assignment of J = 5 to 9 rotational energy levels in the 9070-9370 cm$^{-1}$ range of methane using optical frequency comb double-resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use optical-optical double-resonance (OODR) spectroscopy with a continuous wave (CW) pump and a cavity-enhanced frequency comb probe to measure high rotational energy levels of methane in the upper part of the triacontad polyad (P6). A high-power CW optical parametric oscillator, tunable around 3000 cm$^{-1}$, is consecutively locked to the P(7, A$_2$), Q(7, A$_2$), R(7, A$_2$), and Q(6, F$_2$) transitions in the ${\nu}$$_3$ band, and a comb covering the 5800-6100 cm$^{-1}$ range probes sub-Doppler ladder-type transitions from the pumped levels with J' = 6 to 8, respectively. We report 118 probe transitions in the 3${\nu}$$_3$ $\leftarrow$ ${\nu}$$_3$ spectral range with uncertainties down to 300 kHz (1 x 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-1}$), reaching 84 unique final states in the 9070-9370 cm$^{-1}$ range with rotational quantum numbers J between 5 and 9. We assign these states using combination differences and by comparison to theoretical predictions from a new ab initio-based effective Hamiltonian and dipole moment operator. This is the first line-by-line experimental verification of theoretical predictions for these hot-band transitions, and we find a better agreement of transition wavenumbers with the new calculations compared to the TheoReTS/HITEMP and ExoMol databases. We also compare the relative intensities and find an overall good agreement with all three sets of predictions. Finally, we report the wavenumbers of 27 transitions in the 2${\nu}$$_3$ spectral range, observed as V-type transitions from the ground state, and compare them to the new Hamiltonian, HITRAN2020, ExoMol and the WKMLC line lists.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with multi-Slater determinant trial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can be systematically improved with better trial states. Using multi-Slater determinant trial states, ph-AFQMC has the potential to faithfully treat strongly correlated systems, while balancing the static and dynamical correlations on an equal footing. This preprint presents an implementation and application of graphics processing unit-accelerated ph-AFQMC, for multi-Slater determinant trial wavefunctions (GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC), to enable efficient simulation of large-scale, strongly correlated systems. This approach allows for nearly-exact computation of ground state energies in multi-reference systems. Our GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC is implemented in the open-source code \texttt{ipie}, a Python-based AFQMC package [\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}, 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. We benchmark the performance of the GPU code on transition-metal clusters like [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. The GPU code achieves at least sixfold speedup in both cases, comparing the timings of a single A100 GPU to that of a 32-CPU node. For [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$, we demonstrate that our GPU MSD-AFQMC can recover the dynamical correlation necessary for chemical accuracy with an MSD trial, despite the large number of determinants required ($&gt;10^5$). Our work significantly enhances the efficiency of MSD-AFQMC calculations for large, strongly correlated molecules by utilizing GPUs, offering a promising path for exploring the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and fixing common problems in Bayesian optimization for molecule design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a principled approach to molecular design tasks. In this paper we explain three pitfalls of BO which can cause poor empirical performance: an incorrect prior width, over-smoothing, and inadequate acquisition function maximization. We show that with these issues addressed, even a basic BO setup is able to achieve the highest overall performance on the PMO benchmark for molecule design (Gao et al, 2022). These results suggest that BO may benefit from more attention in the machine learning for molecules community.</description>

      <title>Rotational spectroscopy of CH$_3$OD with a reanalysis of CH$_3$OD toward IRAS 16293$-$2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have started a measurement campaign of numerous methanol isotopologs in low-lying torsional states in order to provide extensive line lists for radio astronomical observations from an adequate spectroscopic model and to investigate how the intricate vibration-torsion-rotation interactions manifest themselves in the spectra of different isotopic species. After CD$_3$OH and CD$_3$OD, we turn our focus to CH$_3$OD, which is an important species for studying deuteration in prestellar cores and envelopes that enshroud protostars. Notably, deuteration is frequently viewed as a diagnostic tool for star formation. The measurements used in this study were obtained in two spectroscopic laboratories and cover large fractions of the 34 GHz--1.35 THz range. As done in previous studies, we employed a torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model for our analysis that is based on the rho-axis method. The resulting model describes the ground and first excited torsional states of CH$_3$OD well up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 51$ and $K_a \leqslant 18$. We derived a line list for radio astronomical observations from this model that is accurate up to at least 1.35~THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog in these two lowest torsional states. This line list was applied to a reinvestigation of CH$_3$OD in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293--2422 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The new accurately determined value for the column density of CH$_3$OD implies that the deuteration in methanol differs in its two functional groups by a factor of $\sim$7.5.</description>

      <title>A modified expression for the Hamiltonian expectation value exploiting the short-range behavior of the wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expectation value of the Hamiltonian using a model wave function is widely used to estimate the eigenvalues of electronic Hamiltonians. We explore here a modified formula for models based on long-range interaction. It scales differently the singlet and triplet component of the repulsion between electrons not present in the model (its short-range part). The scaling factors depend uniquely on the parameter used in defining the model interaction, and are constructed using only exact properties. We show results for the ground states and low-lying excited states of Harmonium with two to six electrons. We obtain important improvements for the estimation of the exact energy, not only over the model energy, but also over the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning of the Rotational Rate of Light-Driven, Second Generation Molecular Motors by Fluorine Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation time of several second generation molecular motors is analysed by calculating the minimum energy path between the metastable and stable states and evaluating the transition rate within harmonic transition state theory based on energetics obtained from density functional theory. Comparison with published experimental data shows remarkably good agreement and demonstrates the predictive capability of the theoretical approach. While previous measurements by Feringa and coworkers [Chem.\,Eur.\,J.\,(2017) 23, 6643] have shown that a replacement of the stereogenic hydrogen by a fluorine atom increases the relaxation time because of destabilization of the transition state for the thermal helix inversion, we find that a replacement of CH$_3$ by a CF$_3$ group at the same site shortens the relaxation time because of elevated energy of the metastable state without a significant shift in the transition state energy. Since these two fluorine substitutions have an opposite effect on the relaxation time, the two combined can provide a way to fine tune the rotational speed of a molecular motor.</description>

      <title>Computation of the expectation value of the spin operator $\hat{S}^2$ for the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-flip methods applied to excited-state approaches like the Bethe-Salpeter Equation allow access to the excitation energies of open-shell systems, such as molecules and defects in solids. The eigenstates of these solutions, however, are generally not eigenstates of the spin operator $\hat{S}^2$. Even for simple cases where the excitation vector is expected to be, for example, a triplet state, the value of $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ may be found to differ from 2.00; this difference is called ``spin contamination.'' The expectation values $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ must be computed for each excitation vector, to assist with the characterization of the particular excitation and to determine the amount of spin contamination of the state. Our aim is to provide for the first time in the spin-flip methods literature a comprehensive resource on the derivation of the formulas for $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ as well as its computational implementation. After a brief discussion of the theory of the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation and some examples further illustrating the need for calculating $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$, we present the derivation for the general equation for computing $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ with the eigenvectors from an SF-BSE calculation, how it is implemented in a Python script, and timing information on how this calculation scales with the size of the SF-BSE Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results comparable to other calculations on 1D, 2D, and 3D UEGs, which indicates promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for quantum-mechanical calculations, but practical calculations suffer systematic errors like incorrect charge densities and total energies in molecular dissociation, underestimated band gaps in bulk materials, and poor energy level alignment at interfaces. These problems are due to delocalization error. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) removes delocalization error in molecules effectively, but screening of the Hartree-exchange-correlation response is necessary to correct it in materials. We introduce LOSC with system-dependent linear-response screening (lrLOSC), which effectively corrects delocalization error in semiconductors and insulators. After correcting for electron-phonon effects, the band gaps of eleven test systems are predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.28 eV, comparable to self-consistent $GW$. This method represents a significant step forward in correcting densities and total energies across system sizes and solving the band gap and energy level alignment problems entirely within the DFT framework.</description>
