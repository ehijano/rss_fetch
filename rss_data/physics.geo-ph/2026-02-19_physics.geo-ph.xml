      <title>An Interpretable Physics Informed Multi-Stream Deep Learning Architecture for the Discrimination between Earthquake, Quarry Blast and Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable discrimination of tectonic earthquakes from anthropogenic quarry blasts and transient noise remains a critical challenge in single station seismic monitoring. In this study, we introduce a novel Physics Informed Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (PI CRNN) that embeds seismological domain knowledge directly into the feature extraction and learning process. We adapt a multistream architecture with three parallel encoders: (i) Time Domain: SincNet Encoder, (ii) MultiResolution Spectrogram branch, and, (iii) Physics Branch, followed by a fusion and a bidirectionalLSTM module. Evaluated on the Curated Pacific Northwest AI ready Seismic Dataset, the PI CRNN achieves an overall classification accuracy of 97.56 percent on an independent test set. It outperforms a standard CRNN baseline, a classical P to S amplitude ratio method, and a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) that enforces physical constraints via the loss function. Furthermore, the model demonstrates perfect precision in noise rejection (100 percent Recall). Interpretability analysis using saliency maps confirms that the architecture successfully learns distinct physical signatures, identifying bimodal P- and S-wave arrivals for earthquakes versus singular impulsive onsets for blasts. This work establishes a scalable, transparent framework for AI-driven seismology, proving that architectural inductive bias provides an alternative reliable approach compared to purely data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Ponomarenko dynamo sustained by a free swirling jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical results on dynamo action in a flow driven by an azimuthal body force localized near the end of an elongated cylindrical container. The analysis focuses on the central region of the cylinder, where axial variations in the flow are relatively weak, allowing the magnetic field to be represented as a helically traveling wave. Four magnetic impeller configurations and multiple forcing intensities are examined. In all cases, the velocity profiles in the central region display a similar \propto r^{-2} dependence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers and forcing region widths. The magnetic field is found to start growing under conditions similar to those of the Riga dynamo. However, the growing modes exhibit a substantial nonzero group velocity, indicating that the associated instability is convective: the flow can amplify an externally applied magnetic field but cannot sustain it autonomously. We outline several approaches for overcoming this limitation in order to realize a working laboratory dynamo based on an internally unconstrained swirling jet-type flow.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Role of 3D Fault Geometry Complexities on Slow and Fast Earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional models of slow slip events (SSEs) often oversimplify fault geometry, yet imaging studies show that real subduction faults are segmented and complex. We investigate how fault interactions influence slip behavior using 3D quasi-dynamic earthquake sequence simulations of two parallel faults with uniform rate-weakening friction, accelerated with hierarchical matrices. Our results identify four slip regimes-periodic earthquakes, coexisting SSEs and earthquakes, only SSEs, and complex sequences-while a single planar fault under the same conditions produces only earthquakes. We quantify fault interaction using the maximum Coulomb stress induced on a target fault by unit, spatially uniform stress drop on a neighboring fault. Because the source stress drop is normalized, the metric depends only on geometry and is independent of friction and nucleation length, and it can be extended to arbitrary fault configurations. The occurrence of SSEs is confined to an intermediate range of interaction strength. We also reproduce the observed moment-duration scaling and show that it depends on event detection thresholds. These results demonstrate that complex fault geometry can naturally generate both slow and fast earthquakes through evolving traction heterogeneities.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning improves reconstruction of global historical climate records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate assessment of anthropogenic climate change relies on historical instrumental data, yet observations from the early 20th century are sparse, fragmented, and uncertain. Conventional reconstructions rely on disparate statistical interpolation, which excessively smooths local features and creates unphysical artifacts, leading to systematic underestimation of intrinsic variability and extremes. Here, we present a unified, probabilistic generative deep learning framework that overcomes these limitations and reveals previously unresolved historical climate variability back to 1850. Leveraging a learned generative prior of Earth system dynamics, our model performs probabilistic inference to recover spatiotemporally consistent historical temperature and precipitation fields from sparse observations. Our approach preserves the higher-order statistics of climate dynamics, transforming reconstruction into a robust uncertainty-aware assessment. We demonstrate that our reconstruction overcomes pronounced biases in widely used historical reference products, including those underlying IPCC assessments, especially regarding extreme weather events. Notably, we uncover higher early 20th-century global warming levels compared to existing reconstructions, primarily driven by more pronounced polar warming, with mean Arctic warming trends exceeding established benchmarks by 0.15--0.29{\deg}C per decade for 1900--1980. Conversely, for the modern era, our reconstruction indicates that the broad Arctic warming trend is likely overestimated in recent assessments, yet explicitly resolves previously unrecognized intense, localized hotspots in the Barents Sea and Northeastern Greenland. Furthermore, based on our seamless global reconstruction that recovers precipitation variability across the oceans and under-monitored regions, we uncover an intensification of the global hydrological cycle.</description>
