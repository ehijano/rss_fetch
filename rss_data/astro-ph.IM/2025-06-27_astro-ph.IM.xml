      <title>Probing Equatorial Ionospheric TEC at Sub-GHz Frequencies with Wide-Band (B4) uGMRT Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase stability at low radio frequencies is severely impacted by ionospheric propagation delays. Radio interferometers such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) are capable of detecting changes in the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC) over larger spatial scales and with greater sensitivity compared to conventional tools like the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Thanks to its unique design featuring both a dense central array and long outer arms-and its strategic location, the GMRT is particularly well-suited for studying the sensitive ionospheric region located between the northern peak of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) and the magnetic equator. In this study, we observe the bright flux calibrator 3C48 for ten hours to characterize and study the low-latitude ionosphere with the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT). We outline the methods used for wideband data reduction and processing to accurately measure differential TEC (dTEC) between antenna pairs, achieving a precision of less than 1 mTECU for the central square antennas and approximately 1 mTECU for the arm antennas. The measured dTEC values are used to estimate the TEC gradient across the GMRT arm antennas. We measure the ionospheric phase structure function and find a power-law slope of $\beta = 1.72$, indicating deviations from pure Kolmogorov turbulence. The inferred diffractive scale the spatial separation over which the phase variance reaches $1 \text{rad}^2$ is 6.66 km. A small diffractive scale implies high phase variability across the field of view and reduced temporal coherence, which poses challenges for calibration and imaging.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Beam Inference II: Inference of a Perturbed HERA Beam from Simulated Visibility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate beam modeling is important in many radio astronomy applications. In this paper, we focus on beam modeling for 21-cm intensity mapping experiments using radio interferometers, though the techniques also apply to single dish experiments with small modifications. In 21-cm intensity mapping, beam models are usually determined from highly detailed electromagnetic simulations of the receiver system. However, these simulations are expensive, and therefore have limited ability to describe practical imperfections in the beam pattern. We present a fully analytic Bayesian inference framework to infer a beam pattern from the interferometric visibilities assuming a particular sky model and that the beam pattern for all elements is identical, allowing one to capture deviations from the ideal beam for relatively low computational cost. We represent the beam using a sparse Fourier-Bessel basis on a projection of the hemisphere to the unit disc, but the framework applies to any linear basis expansion of the primary beam. We test the framework on simulated visibilities from an unpolarized sky, ignoring mutual coupling of array elements. We successfully recover the simulated, perturbed power beam when the sky model is perfect. Briefly exploring sky model inaccuracies, we find that beam inferences are sensitive to them, so we suggest jointly modeling uncertainties in the sky and beam in related inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Latent-space Field Tension for Astrophysical Component Detection An application to X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh Criterion: Resolution Limits of Astronomical Periodograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion determines the resolution limit of a periodogram, which is the minimum frequency separation required to barely resolve two sinusoids. Failing to consider the Rayleigh criterion may result in incorrect interpretations of long-period signals or spurious claims that two closely spaced periodogram peaks represent two distinct physical processes. We demonstrate how applying the Rayleigh criterion can help observers avoid false positive detections caused by uneven observing cadence or insufficient observing time baseline. We present three synthetic datasets that illustrate (1) a single oscillation with a split Lomb-Scargle periodogram peak resulting from uneven observing cadence can be mistaken for two oscillations if the Rayleigh criterion is neglected, (2) oversampling a periodogram's frequency grid does not improve resolution, and (3) observing time baseline requirements for resolving two closely spaced oscillations. We use the Rayleigh criterion to revisit detections of planets, stellar activity, and differential rotation from four published datasets. We show that the frequency separation between planet 55~Cnc~d and the activity cycle is too small to distinguish the two phenomena based on published radial velocities (RVs) alone. Likewise, the contested 4970-day planet orbiting HD~99492 cannot be statistically separated from zero frequency. We determine that a cubic polynomial better explains the long-term RV variability of Barnard's star than a sinusoid model. Finally, our re-analysis of {\it Kepler} observations of two active stars shows that the signals previously attributed to differential rotation can be modeled by a Gaussian process with a single quasiperiodicity. This work demonstrates the importance of the Rayleigh criterion when constructing a time-domain model.</description>

      <title>Achieving Gender Representation in Lead-Author Publications in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the publication rates of 400 research-focused members in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence by gender, project, and year from January 2018 to January 2024 (six years). Of the 443 refereed publications led by ASTRO3D members, women were first-author on 38% which is nearly double that of the astronomy field in the same period (~20%). We record a high-water mark in 2022: 46% of ASTRO3D publications were led by females and 45% of research members identified as female. Using the nine research projects in ASTRO3D, we show that the combination of female leadership and higher fraction of female members correlates with a higher fraction of female-led publications. We find no correlation between the fraction of female-led publications and project size. Our findings demonstrate that gender representation in refereed publications can be achieved within ~5 years by combining evidence-based recruitment strategies with representation in supervisors and collaborations. We recommend that strategies for improving STEM participation focus on both female leadership and female representation to maximize effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>One Giant Leap for Womankind: First Menstrual Cups Tested in Space Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early days of space exploration, when Sally Ride was offered 100 tampons for a week-long mission, menstrual medical devices first began to be used in space conditions. Since then, hormonal menstrual suppression has become the preferred method for managing menstruation in space, offering significant advantages. However, this is not an option for astronauts who choose to menstruate. The lack of sustainable menstrual technologies will pose challenges for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, where astronauts may spend years in space. The AstroCup mission represents the first effort to test menstrual cups in spaceflight, evaluating their durability and functionality. Through material integrity tests and functional assessments using a rheological analogue of human blood, we demonstrate the resilience of menstrual cups and discuss their implications for sustainable menstrual management in future lunar and Martian missions.</description>

      <title>Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries. VII. Interferometric module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric measurements are essential to constrain models of stellar systems, by spatially resolving angular distances and diameters well below the classical diffraction limit. In this work, we describe the interferometric module of Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. Since binaries in Phoebe are represented by a triangular mesh, our complex model is based on the integration over triangles. Consequently, Roche distortion, rotation, non-synchronicity, misalignment, eclipses of components, darkening, reflection, or irradiation are all accurately accounted for. For comparison purposes, we provide a simplified model, where components are represented by circular disks. The key point of our approach is a possibility of combination with other datasets (light curves, radial velocities), which allows to construct robust models of stellar systems.

      <title>Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries. IX. Spectroscopic module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations constrain the fundamental properties of stellar atmospheres, in particular, the effective temperature, the gravitational acceleration, or the metallicity. In this work, we describe the spectroscopic module for Phoebe, which allows for modelling of spectra, either normalized, or in absolute units (${\rm W}\,{\rm m}^{-2}\,{\rm m}^{-1}$). The module is based on extensive grids of synthetic spectra, taken from literature, which are interpolated and integrated over the surface. As an approximation, we assume that limb darkening is given by an analytical law, while other effects (e.g., eclipses) are treated self-consistently. Our approach is suitable for single stars, binaries, or multiples, and can be further extended to systems with pulsating components.

      <title>Identification of Noise-Associated Glitches in KAGRA O3GK with Hveto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient noise ("glitches") in gravitational wave detectors can mimic or obscure true signals, significantly reducing detection sensitivity. Identifying and excluding glitch-contaminated data segments is therefore crucial for enhancing the performance of gravitational-wave searches. We perform a noise analysis of the KAGRA data obtained during the O3GK observation. Our analysis is performed with hierarchical veto (Hveto) which identifies noises based on the statistical time correlation between the main channel and the auxiliary channels. A total of 2,531 noises were vetoed by 28 auxiliary channels with the configuration (i.e., signal-to-noise threshold set to 8) that we chose for Hveto. We identify vetoed events as glitches on the spectrogram via visual examination after plotting them with Q-transformation. By referring to the Gravity Spy project, we categorize 2,354 glitches into six types: blip, helix, scratchy, and scattered light, which correspond to those listed in Gravity Spy, and dot and line, which are not found in the Gravity Spy classification and are thus named based on their spectrogram morphology in KAGRA data. The remaining 177 glitches are determined not to belong to any of these six types. We show how the KAGRA glitch types are related to each subsystem of KAGRA. To investigate the possible correlation between the main channel and the round winner - an auxiliary channel statistically associated with the main channel for vetoing purposes - we visually examine the similarity or difference in the glitch pattern on the spectrogram. We compare the qualitative correlation found through visual examination with coherence, which is known to provide quantitative measurement for the correlation between the main channel and each auxiliary channel. Our comprehensive noise analysis will help improve the data quality of KAGRA by applying it to future KAGRA observation data.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Light Curve Parameter Estimation Using Likelihood-Free Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid parameter estimation is critical when dealing with short lived signals such as kilonovae. We present a parameter estimation algorithm that combines likelihood-free inference with a pre-trained embedding network, optimized to efficiently process kilonova light curves. Our method is capable of retrieving the mass, velocity, and lanthanide fraction of the neutron star ejecta with an accuracy and precision on par with nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. Our inference uniquely utilizes a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal, allowing inference of signals at distances up to 200 Mpc. We find that including a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time, model size, and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase, enabling the broader scientific community to deploy the model for their inference purposes. Our algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects, and can be adapted for quick sky localization.</description>

      <title>Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity</title>

Abstract: We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that, given a sufficiently large sample size (&gt; 1000), both the ML-based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. For sample sizes between 300 and 1000, the ML-based method yields the best performance. In the low data regime (&lt; 300), the ML-based method maintains comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave detectors have achieved remarkable sensitivity around 100 Hz, enabling ground-breaking discoveries. Enhancing sensitivity at higher frequencies in the kilohertz (kHz) range promises access to rich physics, particularly the extreme conditions during the merger stage of binary neutron stars. However, the high-frequency sensitivity of Michelson-based interferometers is fundamentally limited by their linear optical cavities, which are optimized for low-frequency signal enhancement. In [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)], a new configuration employing an L-shaped optical resonator was proposed to overcome this limitation, offering exceptional sensitivity in the kHz band. As a pathfinder, the 12-meter prototype at Beijing Normal University is designed to demonstrate the sensing and control schemes of this new kHz detector configuration and to explore its performance in the high-power regime with suspended optics. Beyond its primary scientific goal, the prototype also offers potential sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, potentially enabling constraints on exotic sources. This paper presents an overview of the prototype, including its optical design and current development status of key components.</description>
