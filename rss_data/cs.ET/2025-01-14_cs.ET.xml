      <title>On How Traffic Signals Impact the Fundamental Diagrams of Urban Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being widely adopted by the transportation and planning practitioners, the fundamental diagram (FD) is the primary tool used to relate the key macroscopic traffic variables of speed, flow, and density. We empirically analyze the relation between vehicular space-mean speeds and flows given different signal settings and postulate a parsimonious parametric function form of the traditional FD where its function parameters are explicitly modeled as a function of the signal plan factors. We validate the proposed formulation using data from signalized urban road segments in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The proposed formulation builds our understanding of how changes to signal settings impact the FDs, and more generally the congestion patterns, of signalized urban segments.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air FEEL with Integrated Sensing: Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing wireless systems with dual sensing and communications functionalities is becoming critical in next generation of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a robust design for over-the-air federated edge learning (OTA-FEEL) that leverages sensing capabilities at the parameter server (PS) to mitigate the impact of target echoes on the analog model aggregation. We first derive novel expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound of the target response and mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated global model to measure radar sensing and model aggregation quality, respectively. Then, we develop a joint scheduling and beamforming framework that optimizes the OTA-FEEL performance while keeping the sensing and communication quality, determined respectively in terms of Cramer-Rao bound and achievable downlink rate, in a desired range. The resulting scheduling problem reduces to a combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). We develop a low-complexity hierarchical method based on the matching pursuit algorithm used widely for sparse recovery in the literature of compressed sensing. The proposed algorithm uses a step-wise strategy to omit the least effective devices in each iteration based on a metric that captures both the aggregation and sensing quality of the system. It further invokes alternating optimization scheme to iteratively update the downlink beamforming and uplink post-processing by marginally optimizing them in each iteration. Convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Numerical evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The results show that by leveraging accurate sensing, the target echoes on the uplink signal can be effectively suppressed, ensuring the quality of model aggregation to remain intact despite the interference.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of High-Speed Universal Shift Register with 4-bit ALU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains information about the universal shift register. In the early stages of this paper, this paper introduces different types of flip flops and calculates the delay. After that, different types of flip flops are used to make a universal shift register, and the high-speed universal shift register is measured using a timing diagram. In addition, a complete memory system was designed at the end of this paper. A universal shift register with 4-bit Alu was added to complete the memory system. As a result, this method has created an accurate memory storage device with high-speed characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are poised to revolutionize next-generation wireless networks by enabling simultaneous sensing and communication (S\&amp;C). This survey comprehensively reviews UAV-ISAC systems, highlighting foundational concepts, key advancements, and future research directions. We explore recent advancements in UAV-based ISAC systems from various perspectives and objectives, including advanced channel estimation (CE), beam tracking, and system throughput optimization under joint sensing and communication S\&amp;C constraints. Additionally, we examine weighted sum rate (WSR) and sensing trade-offs, delay and age of information (AoI) minimization, energy efficiency (EE), and security enhancement. These applications highlight the potential of UAV-based ISAC systems to improve spectrum utilization, enhance communication reliability, reduce latency, and optimize energy consumption across diverse domains, including smart cities, disaster relief, and defense operations. The survey also features summary tables for comparative analysis of existing methodologies, emphasizing performance, limitations, and effectiveness in addressing various challenges. By synthesizing recent advancements and identifying open research challenges, this survey aims to be a valuable resource for developing efficient, adaptive, and secure UAV-based ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 3D FPGAs Utilizing Back-End-of-Line Configuration Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel monolithic 3D (M3D) FPGA architecture that leverages stackable back-end-of-line (BEOL) transistors to implement configuration memory and pass gates, significantly improving area, latency, and power efficiency. By integrating n-type (W-doped In_2O_3) and p-type (SnO) amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in the BEOL, Si SRAM configuration bits are substituted with a less leaky equivalent that can be programmed at logic-compatible voltages. BEOL-compatible AOS transistors are currently under extensive research and development in the device community, with investment by leading foundries, from which reported data is used to develop robust physics-based models in TCAD that enable circuit design. The use of AOS pass gates reduces the overhead of reconfigurable circuits by mapping FPGA switch block (SB) and connection block (CB) matrices above configurable logic blocks (CLBs), thereby increasing the proximity of logic elements and reducing latency. By interfacing with the latest Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) suite, an AOS-based M3D FPGA design implemented in 7 nm technology is demonstrated with 3.4x lower area-time squared product (AT^2), 27% lower critical path latency, and 26% lower reconfigurable routing block power on benchmarks including hyperdimensional computing and large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>COMPASS: A Compiler Framework for Resource-Constrained Crossbar-Array Based In-Memory Deep Learning Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, crossbar array based in-memory accelerators have been gaining interest due to their high throughput and energy efficiency. While software and compiler support for the in-memory accelerators has also been introduced, they are currently limited to the case where all weights are assumed to be on-chip. This limitation becomes apparent with the significantly increasing network sizes compared to the in-memory footprint.
  Weight replacement schemes are essential to address this issue. We propose COMPASS, a compiler framework for resource-constrained crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM) deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. COMPASS is specially targeted for networks that exceed the capacity of PIM crossbar arrays, necessitating access to external memories. We propose an algorithm to determine the optimal partitioning that divides the layers so that each partition can be accelerated on chip. Our scheme takes into account the data dependence between layers, core utilization, and the number of write instructions to minimize latency, memory accesses, and improve energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that COMPASS can accommodate much more networks using a minimal memory footprint, while improving throughput by 1.78X and providing 1.28X savings in energy-delay product (EDP) over baseline partitioning methods.</description>

      <title>MedGrad E-CLIP: Enhancing Trust and Transparency in AI-Driven Skin Lesion Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning models gain attraction in medical data, ensuring transparent and trustworthy decision-making is essential. In skin cancer diagnosis, while advancements in lesion detection and classification have improved accuracy, the black-box nature of these methods poses challenges in understanding their decision processes, leading to trust issues among physicians. This study leverages the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, trained on different skin lesion datasets, to capture meaningful relationships between visual features and diagnostic criteria terms. To further enhance transparency, we propose a method called MedGrad E-CLIP, which builds on gradient-based E-CLIP by incorporating a weighted entropy mechanism designed for complex medical imaging like skin lesions. This approach highlights critical image regions linked to specific diagnostic descriptions. The developed integrated pipeline not only classifies skin lesions by matching corresponding descriptions but also adds an essential layer of explainability developed especially for medical data. By visually explaining how different features in an image relates to diagnostic criteria, this approach demonstrates the potential of advanced vision-language models in medical image analysis, ultimately improving transparency, robustness, and trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating sophistication and volume of cyber threats in cloud environments necessitate a paradigm shift in strategies. Recognising the need for an automated and precise response to cyber threats, this research explores the application of AI and ML and proposes an AI-powered cyber incident response system for cloud environments. This system, encompassing Network Traffic Classification, Web Intrusion Detection, and post-incident Malware Analysis (built as a Flask application), achieves seamless integration across platforms like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. The findings from this research highlight the effectiveness of the Random Forest model, achieving an accuracy of 90% for the Network Traffic Classifier and 96% for the Malware Analysis Dual Model application. Our research highlights the strengths of AI-powered cyber security. The Random Forest model excels at classifying cyber threats, offering an efficient and robust solution. Deep learning models significantly improve accuracy, and their resource demands can be managed using cloud-based TPUs and GPUs. Cloud environments themselves provide a perfect platform for hosting these AI/ML systems, while container technology ensures both efficiency and scalability. These findings demonstrate the contribution of the AI-led system in guaranteeing a robust and scalable cyber incident response solution in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Governance of Autonomous AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous AI agents present transformative opportunities and significant governance challenges. Existing frameworks, such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, fall short of addressing the complexities of these agents, which are capable of independent decision-making, learning, and adaptation. To bridge these gaps, we propose the ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework, a decentralized governance (DeGov) model leveraging Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). ETHOS establishes a global registry for AI agents, enabling dynamic risk classification, proportional oversight, and automated compliance monitoring through tools like soulbound tokens and zero-knowledge proofs. Furthermore, the framework incorporates decentralized justice systems for transparent dispute resolution and introduces AI specific legal entities to manage limited liability, supported by mandatory insurance to ensure financial accountability and incentivize ethical design. By integrating philosophical principles of rationality, ethical grounding, and goal alignment, ETHOS aims to create a robust research agenda for promoting trust, transparency, and participatory governance. This innovative framework offers a scalable and inclusive strategy for regulating AI agents, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility to meet the demands of an AI-driven future.</description>
