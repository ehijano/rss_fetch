      <title>Derived categories of quadric bundles and moduli stacks of spinor sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Kuznetsov component of a flat family of even-dimensional quadrics of corank at most 2 is equivalent to the twisted derived category of an algebraic space whenever: (i) the open subset of the base over which the quadrics has corank at most 1 is scheme-theoretically dense; and (ii) a certain \'etale double cover of the closed complement admits a section. This provides the first general geometricity result for Kuznetsov components of higher dimensional quadrics, thereby generalizing works of Kapranov, Bondal, Orlov, Kuznetsov, Moschetti, Xie, and others. Our main tool is the moduli stack of spinor sheaves on a family of quadrics, which we define and study in detail. In the situation of our main result, we produce an open substack which is a $\mathbf{G}_m$-gerbe, and show that the associated twisted derived category is equivalent to the Kuznetsov component of the family of quadrics, thereby providing a geometric interpretation of the Brauer classes appearing in previous works.</description>

      <title>A guide to wall crossing for moduli of varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been major developments in the theory of moduli of varieties in the past decade, essentially settling the construction of moduli spaces of log canonically polarized slc pairs and moduli spaces of K-polystable log Fano pairs. Given the construction of these moduli spaces of pairs $(X, D)$, it is natural to ask how the moduli spaces vary as the coefficients of $D$ are perturbed. This phenomenon is known as wall crossing, the theory of which has been developed in several important cases in the past five years. This semi-expository article is an introduction to moduli of varieties and wall crossing, capturing a portion of the theory developed in the past several years. It also introduces tools and techniques used in explicit computations and examples, applying them in new examples.</description>

      <title>The $G$-Noncommutative Minimal Model Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $G$-equivariant noncommutative minimal model program ($G$-NMMP), as an equivariant generalization of the framework introduced in arXiv:2301.13168. The aim of this program is to construct quasi-convergent paths in the spaces of Bridgeland stability conditions on derived categories of $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves. For finite groups, we employ induction techniques to construct such paths from the non-equivariant setting. In the setting of algebraic group actions, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb T$-stability conditions to reformulate the proposal, and then we construct quasi-convergent paths for equivariant projective spaces from small quantum cohomology.</description>

      <title>A super Version of a Theorem of Fricke and Klein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start studying the character variety of the algebraic supergroup OSp(1|2) from the algebraic perspective. We do this by first investigating the specific case of the character variety of the free group on two letters and try to describe the ring of invariants with respect to the conjugation action. The explicit description of the corresponding character variety for SL(2) was done by Fricke and Klein, so this can be seen as a variant of this theorem for its supergeometric counterpart OSp(1|2).</description>

      <title>Quotients by $(p-1)/p$-klt Foliations on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between birational singularities of 1-foliations and those of their quotients. We prove that the quotient $X/\mathcal{F}$ is log canonical (resp. klt) if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is $\frac{p-1}{p}$-log canonical (resp. $\frac{p-1}{p}$-klt). Moreover, we obtain the classification of klt quotients by $1$-foliations on regular surfaces in the cases $p=2,3$ and $5$.</description>

      <title>Distributions with Unstable Tangent Sheaf on $\mathbb{P}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study codimension one distributions on the projective three-space, focusing on cases where the tangent sheaf of the distribution is nonsplit and unstable. We relate the order of nonstability to the degree of the induced subfoliation by curves, showing that the order of nonstability is bounded. Moreover, we classify the tangent sheaf of the codimension one distributions that admit a subfoliation by curves of degree 1. In other words, assuming the sheaf is nonsplit, we classify the situations in which the tangent sheaf attains the maximal possible order of nonstability.</description>

      <title>An invitation to the enumerative geometry of degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article is an introduction to logarithmic Gromov--Witten (GW) theory. We discuss how to study the GW theory of a smooth projective variety via simple normal crossings degenerations. We survey several approaches to constructing well-behaved, virtually smooth moduli spaces of stable maps to such degenerations. Each irreducible component of the special fiber of a degeneration determines a pair consisting of a variety and a normal crossings divisor, and these pairs carry their own logarithmic GW theory. We explain how the GW theory of the general fiber can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic GW theory of these pairs. Finally, we discuss applications to tautological classes on the moduli space of curves.</description>

      <title>The Strong Monodromy Conjecture for a class of homogeneous polynomials in three variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of all homogeneous, possibly non-reduced, polynomials $f$ whose associated reduced projective divisor $D_{\text{red}} \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ has (at worst) quasi-homogeneous isolated singularities. In an arbitrary number of variables $n$ and with $d$ denoting the degree of $f$, we characterize when $-n/d$ is a root of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$ in terms of elementary data involving logarithmic derivations. When we restrict to three variables, we prove the resulting class of polynomials satisfies the Strong Monodromy Conjecture, in the motivic sense.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Brauer group of the ring $\mathcal{O}(S)$ of holomorphic functions on a finite-dimensional Stein space S. We provide a purely topological computation of this group and deduce a comparison theorem between the \'etale cohomology of $\textrm{Spec}(\mathcal{O}(S))$ and the singular cohomology of S in degree 2. Furthermore, we prove a purity theorem when S is nonsingular and study the index of classes in the Brauer group of $\mathcal{O}(S)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the 4-dimensional Galois representations associated with a certain Calabi-Yau threefold are reducible, with 2-dimensional composition factors coming from specific modular forms of weights 2 and 4, both level 14. This was essentially conjectured by Meyer and Verrill. It was revisited in its present form by Candelas, de la Ossa, Elmi and van Straten, whose computations of Euler factors in a whole pencil of Calabi-Yau threefolds highlighted this fibre as one of three overwhelmingly likely to be ``rank-2 attractors''.</description>

      <title>Universal Functions for Topological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of topologically twisted, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group ${\rm SU}(2)$ and $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. For a smooth, compact, oriented four-manifold $X$ with $b_2^+&gt;1$, the correlation functions are expressed in terms of a finite set of universal functions. The mass dependence of these functions encodes intersection numbers of the moduli space of instantons. We determine closed expressions for the universal functions by combining techniques of the Seiberg-Witten geometry, $u$-plane integral and the blowup formula. If $X$ is specialised to a complex algebraic surface $S$, the correlation functions can be identified with generating functions of Segre invariants for moduli spaces of sheaves on $S$. We verify that our results agree with the results by G\"ottsche and Kool for these generating functions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant real cycle class map and Witt-sheaf cohomology of classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivariant real cycle class maps for group actions on real schemes, with a view toward Witt-sheaf characteristic classes. The cycle class maps take values in singular cohomology of the real points of the quotient stack, which are identified with the homotopy fixed-points of complex conjugation on the complex points. This provides a strong relation between Witt-sheaf cohomology of the geometric classifying space of a real algebraic group and the singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of its strong real forms, which we discuss in a number of examples. As a sample application, we compute the number of Witt-sheaf cohomological invariants of spin groups over the reals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Hultgren's polytope formulation of the existence of coupled K\"ahler-Einstein (cKE) metrics on toric Fano manifolds, we construct explicit higher-dimensional toric Fano manifolds that admit two coupled K\"ahler-Einstein metrics but no ordinary K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. In particular, we exhibit such examples among certain projective bundles over products of projective spaces. Motivated by these constructions, we conjecture that examples of this type exist in all dimensions $n\geq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to obtain the set of solutions of a multivariate polynomial equation modulo a power of a prime number. These solutions are determined by a tree, called the trunk, which makes it possible to reconstruct all solutions. We apply these methods to determine the number of solutions, without having to enumerate them. We also illustrate these techniques by proving a simple case of Igusa's theorem: the Poincar\'e series associated with a polynomial in two separated variables is rational.</description>

      <title>Preserving Hodge Vectors of Lattice Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given lattice polytopes $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ contained in a $k$-dimensional subspace $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and a $d$-dimensional lattice polytope $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we compute the Hodge vector of the Cayley polytope $P_1 * \cdots * P_k * Q$, and show that it equals the mixed volume of $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ times the Hodge vector of the projection of $Q$ along $U$. Here, the Hodge vector of a lattice polytope is its local $h^*$-vector with leading and trailing zeroes removed. This result allows finding infinitely many high-dimensional lattice polytopes with the same Hodge vector that are not free joins. The proof relies on a closed formula for the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of generic complete intersections in the torus in terms of the bivariate/mixed $h^*$-polynomial. A special case of our construction is what we call Lawrence twists: extending the Gale transform by centrally-symmetric pairs of vectors. As applications, we can produce many new thin polytopes answering a question by Borger, Kretschmer and the second author, and we provide an alternative explanation of the thinness of $B_k$-polytopes answering a question of Selyanin.</description>

      <title>The $d$-dimensional realisation number of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the number of (complex) realisations of a rigid graph for a specific choice of edge lengths is a fundamental problem in discrete geometry. In this article we provide two new tools for determining realisation numbers in arbitrary dimensions: (i) we prove that subgraph inclusion translates to realisation number divisibility; and (ii) we provide lower bounds on realisation numbers under specific graph operations in all dimensions. We use these methods to prove that every triangulated sphere with $n$ vertices has at least $2^{n-4}$ edge-length equivalent realisations in 3-dimensions, extending a 2-dimensional result of Jackson and Owen in the case of planar graphs. Additionally, our tools solve a family of conjectures set by Grasegger regarding how 1-extensions, X-replacements, and V-replacements affect realisation numbers.</description>

      <title>The formal spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To any essentially small tensor-triangulated category $\mathcal{K}$ and Thomason subset $Y \subseteq \mathrm{Spc}(\mathcal{K})$ we associate a ringed space $(\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{K},Y), \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{K},Y)}),$ called the formal spectrum of $(\mathcal{K},Y)$. We establish basic properties of this construction and compute it in several examples from algebraic geometry, chromatic homotopy theory, equivariant homotopy theory, and modular representation theory.</description>

      <title>Stable polynomials and bounded rational functions in the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polynomials with no zeros on the unit ball in complex Euclidean space with a view toward characterizing when a rational function is bounded on the ball. We give a complete local description of such polynomials in two variables near a boundary zero. In higher dimensions, we give a partial characterization of a simple boundary zero. Several applications are given including boundedness of rational functions with boundary singularities and constructions of examples with prescribed local properties.</description>

      <title>On the Semi-Abelianness of Affine Group Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of commutative Hopf algebras over a field $k$ is co-semi-abelian. Consequently, the category of affine group $k$-schemes is semi-abelian. We establish coregularity by identifying the orthogonal factorization system of surjections and faithfully flat injections, and we deduce coexactness from Takeuchi's correspondence between normal Hopf ideals and Hopf subalgebras of commutative Hopf $k$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study derived (auto)equivalences of generalized Kummer varieties $\mathrm{Kum}^n(A)$. We provide an answer to a question raised by Namikawa by showing that the generalized Kummer varieties $\mathrm{Kum}^n(A)$ and $\mathrm{Kum}^n(A^\vee)$ are derived equivalent as long as $n$ is even and the abelian surface $A$ admits a polarization whose exponent is coprime to $n+1$. Furthermore we obtain exact sequences involving groups of autoequivalences in the style of Orlov's short exact sequence for autoequivalences of abelian varieties. Finally, we exhibit generalized Kummer fourfolds which are not birationally equivalent but still derived equivalent.</description>

Abstract: We give a treatment of relative Calabi--Yau structures on functors between $R$-linear stable $\infty$-categories, with $R$ any $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, generalizing previous treatments in the setting of dg-categories. Using their gluing properties, we further construct relative Calabi--Yau structures on the global sections of perverse schobers, i.e. categorified perverse sheaves, on surfaces with boundary. We treat examples related to Fukaya categories and representation theory. In a related direction, we define the monodromy of a perverse schober parametrized by a ribbon graph on a framed surface and show that it forms a local system of stable $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove that the set of log discrepancies for a fixed exponent is discrete. Additionally, we show that the set of log canonical thresholds (lcts) of multi-ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic is contained within the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth variety over the complex number field. As a result, we find that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational if all the exponents are rational. We also obtain ACC for the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth varieties in positive characteristic. This version is rewritten for up to dimension three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note revisits stability conditions on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on irreducible projective curves. In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide a reasonable full boundary, a notion of regular weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins-Lo-Shi-Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On non-rational singular curves, any locally-finite numerical stability condition is shown to be geometric.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of Ulrich sheaves on the Hilbert scheme of two points on a polarized K3 surface or an abelian surface. The construction proceeds by descending Ulrich bundles on the surface to the symmetric square and lifting them to the Hilbert square via the crepant Hilbert--Chow resolution. Finally, we estimate a bound for Ulrich complexity of the Hilbert Square.</description>

      <title>On the birational isotriviality of the Albanese morphism of a log Calabi-Yau pair with a torus action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a projective, log canonical, $K$-trivial pair over the complex numbers. Let $Z$ be a minimal log canonical center of $(X,\Delta)$ and suppose that there exists a torus $\mathbb{T}\subseteq\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ preserving $\Delta$ and such that $\dim\mathbb{T}=\operatorname{codim}_X Z$. Then we show that two general fibers of the Albanese morphism $\operatorname{alb}_X$ are birationally equivalent. In particular, the pathological example of a projective, log canonical, $K$-trivial variety whose Albanese morphism is not generically birationally isotrivial, recently constructed by Bernasconi, Filipazzi, Patakfalvi and Tsakanikas, can be avoided under the additional hypothesis that there exists a torus of large enough dimension in the automorphism group of the given pair.</description>

      <title>Sharply o-minimal structures and sharp cellular decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharply o-minimal structures (denoted \so-minimal) are a strict subclass of the o-minimal structures, aimed at capturing some finer features of structures arising from algebraic geometry and Hodge theory. Sharp o-minimality associates to each definable set a pair of integers known as \emph{format} and \emph{degree}, similar to the ambient dimension and degree in the algebraic case; gives bounds on the growth of these quantities under the logical operations; and allows one to control the geometric complexity of a set in terms of its format and degree. These axioms have significant implications on arithmetic properties of definable sets -- for example, \so-minimality was recently used by the authors to settle Wilkie's conjecture on rational points in $\mathbb{R}_{{\exp}}$-definable sets.
  In this paper we develop some basic theory of sharply o-minimal structures. We introduce the notions of reduction and equivalence on the class of \so-minimal structures. We give three variants of the definition of \so-minimality, of increasing strength, and show that they all agree up to reduction. We also consider the problem of ``sharp cell decomposition'', i.e. cell decomposition with good control on the number of the cells and their formats and degrees. We show that every \so-minimal structure can be reduced to one admitting sharp cell decomposition, and use this to prove bounds on the Betti numbers of definable sets in terms of format and degree.</description>

      <title>Diamonds: Homology and the Central Series of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an analog of a theorem of Stallings which asserts the homomorphisms between the universal nilpotent quotients induced by a homomorphism $G \to H$ of groups are isomorphisms provided a pair of homological conditions are satisfied. Our analogy does not have a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$ but instead $G,H \leq G_0$ that satisfies a similar homological condition. We derive a few applications of this result. First, we show that there exist pairs of non-isomorphic number fields whose absolute Galois groups have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. We show that there exists pairs of non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds whose fundamental groups are residually nilpotent and have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. These are the first examples of residually nilpotent Kleinian groups with arbitrarily large nilpotent genus. Complex hyperbolic 2-manifold examples are given as well. Considering Riemann surfaces and complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds as projective curves and surfaces defined over a number field, we show the (outer) action of the absolute Galois group of the field of definition on the universal nilpotent quotients of the geometric fundamental groups are equivalent. This is in contrast to fact that the (outer) Galois action on the geometric fundamental group of a projective hyperbolic curve determines the curve by work of Mochizuki. In particular, the nilpotent representation theory of the geometric fundamental group is not anabelian.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of lifting the Artin--Schreier--Witt isogeny from characteristic $p&gt;0$ to characteristic $0$, which is central to the lifting problem for Galois covers of algebraic schemes in positive characteristic. We introduce a new technique that associates a Kummer class, representing a tamely ramified cyclic extension, to a Witt vector via Matsuda's Kummer--Artin--Schreier--Witt theory. This viewpoint leads to an explicit construction of a lift of the isogeny over a concrete base ring. Our results lay the groundwork for further applications, including the study of inseparable extensions and Kato's refined Swan conductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a recollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of equivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a singular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement lifts to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As applications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the derived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action comes from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we establish new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.</description>

      <title>Splitting in a complete local ring and decomposition its group of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we reprove by a new method that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In our proof there is no need for the existence of the coefficient field for equi-characteristic complete local rings, whose existence is the hardest part of the known proof. However, the main result of this article is that in the unequal characteristic case $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. As an application of the above theorem, we show that for any complete local ring $(R,M,k)$ the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. Next, we show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for many incomplete local rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric Tevelev degrees of projective space enumerate general, pointed algebraic curves interpolating through the maximal possible number of points. Previous work expresses these invariants in terms of Schubert calculus. Extending ideas of Gillespie--Reimer-Berg, we use the RSK correspondence to give a positive interpretation of these counts in terms of the combinatorics of words.</description>
