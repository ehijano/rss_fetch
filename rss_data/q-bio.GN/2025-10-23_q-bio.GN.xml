      <title>Phenome-Wide Multi-Omics Integration Uncovers Distinct Archetypes of Human Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 10,000 adults aged 40-70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.</description>

      <title>AGNES: Adaptive Graph Neural Network and Dynamic Programming Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Nanopore Seed Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</description>
