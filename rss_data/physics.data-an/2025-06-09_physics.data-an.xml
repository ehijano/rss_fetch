      <title>Scientific machine learning in Hydrology: a unified perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework. This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology, where these methods remain underutilized.</description>

      <title>Nearest neighbor permutation entropy detects phase transitions in complex high-pressure systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the high-pressure phase behavior of carbon dioxide-hydrocarbon mixtures is of considerable interest owing to their wide range of applications. Under certain conditions, these systems are not amenable to direct visual monitoring, and experimentalists often rely on spectrophotometric data to infer phase behavior. Consequently, developing computationally efficient and robust methods to leverage such data is crucial. Here, we combine nearest neighbor permutation entropy, computed directly from in situ near-infrared absorbance spectra acquired during depressurization trials of mixtures of carbon dioxide and a distilled petroleum fraction, with an anomaly detection approach to identify phase transitions. We show that changes in nearest neighbor entropy effectively signal transitions from initially homogeneous mixtures to two-phase equilibria, thereby enabling accurate out-of-sample online predictions of transition pressures. Our approach requires minimum data preprocessing, no specialized detection techniques or visual inspection of the spectra, and is sufficiently general to be adapted for studying phase behavior in other high-pressure systems monitored via spectrophotometry.</description>

      <title>Refugees' path to legal stability is long and systematically unequal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal systems shape not only the recognition of migrants and refugees but also the pace and stability of their integration. Refugees often shift between multiple legal classifications, a process we refer to as the "legal journey". This journey is frequently prolonged and uncertain. Using a network-based approach, we analyze legal transitions for over 350,000 migrants in Austria (2022 to 2024). Refugees face highly unequal pathways to stability, ranging from two months for Ukrainians to nine months for Syrians and 20 months for Afghans. Women, especially from these regions, are more likely to gain protection; Afghan men wait up to 30 months on average. We also find that those who cross the border without going through official border controls face higher exit rates and lower chances of securing stable status. We show that legal integration is not a uniform process, but one structured by institutional design, procedural entry points, and unequal timelines.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant dynamics in a purely deterministic Game of Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex dynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical size and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the question of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly affirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge in the \textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into a Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point -- associated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the non-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with unconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for critical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>
