      <title>Debate-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for Phishing Email Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing attacks remain a critical cybersecurity threat. Attackers constantly refine their methods, making phishing emails harder to detect. Traditional detection methods, including rule-based systems and supervised machine learning models, either rely on predefined patterns like blacklists, which can be bypassed with slight modifications, or require large datasets for training and still can generate false positives and false negatives. In this work, we propose a multi-agent large language model (LLM) prompting technique that simulates debates among agents to detect whether the content presented on an email is phishing. Our approach uses two LLM agents to present arguments for or against the classification task, with a judge agent adjudicating the final verdict based on the quality of reasoning provided. This debate mechanism enables the models to critically analyze contextual cue and deceptive patterns in text, which leads to improved classification accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on multiple phishing email datasets and demonstrate that mixed-agent configurations consistently outperform homogeneous configurations. Results also show that the debate structure itself is sufficient to yield accurate decisions without extra prompting strategies.</description>

      <title>LERO: LLM-driven Evolutionary framework with Hybrid Rewards and Enhanced Observation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces two critical bottlenecks distinct from single-agent RL: credit assignment in cooperative tasks and partial observability of environmental states. We propose LERO, a framework integrating Large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to address these MARL-specific challenges. The solution centers on two LLM-generated components: a hybrid reward function that dynamically allocates individual credit through reward decomposition, and an observation enhancement function that augments partial observations with inferred environmental context. An evolutionary algorithm optimizes these components through iterative MARL training cycles, where top-performing candidates guide subsequent LLM generations. Evaluations in Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MPE) demonstrate LERO's superiority over baseline methods, with improved task performance and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Spatially Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems with Alternating Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) can consist of various networked components and agents interacting and communicating with each other. In the context of spatially distributed CPS, these connections can be dynamically dependent on the spatial configuration of the various components and agents. In these settings, robust monitoring of the distributed components is vital to ensuring complex behaviors are achieved, and safety properties are maintained. To this end, we look at defining the automaton semantics for the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a formal logic designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over mobile, spatially distributed CPS. Specifically, STREL reasons about spatio-temporal behavior over dynamic weighted graphs. While STREL is endowed with well defined qualitative and quantitative semantics, in this paper, we propose a novel construction of (weighted) alternating finite automata from STREL specifications that efficiently encodes these semantics. Moreover, we demonstrate how this automaton semantics can be used to perform both, offline and online monitoring for STREL specifications using a simulated drone swarm environment.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Hybrid Multi-Agent Pathfinding Based on Shared Exploration Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding is used in areas including multi-robot formations, warehouse logistics, and intelligent vehicles. However, many environments are incomplete or frequently change, making it difficult for standard centralized planning or pure reinforcement learning to maintain both global solution quality and local flexibility. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that integrates D* Lite global search with multi-agent reinforcement learning, using a switching mechanism and a freeze-prevention strategy to handle dynamic conditions and crowded settings. We evaluate the framework in the discrete POGEMA environment and compare it with baseline methods. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed framework substantially improves success rate, collision rate, and path efficiency. The model is further tested on the EyeSim platform, where it maintains feasible Pathfinding under frequent changes and large-scale robot deployments.</description>
