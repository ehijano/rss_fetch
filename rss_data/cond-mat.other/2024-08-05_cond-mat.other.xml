      <title>Atomistic simulations of out-of-equilibrium quantum nuclear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in ultrafast laser technology have paved the way for pumping and probing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of nuclei in crystals. However, interpreting these experiments is extremely challenging due to the complex nonlinear responses in systems where lattice excitations interact, particularly in crystals composed of light atoms or at low temperatures where the quantum nature of ions becomes significant. In this work, we address the nonequilibrium quantum ionic dynamics from first principles. Our approach is general and can be applied to simulate any crystal, in combination with a first-principles treatment of electrons or external machine-learning potentials. It is implemented by leveraging the nonequilibrium time-dependent self-consistent harmonic approximation (TD-SCHA), with a stable, energy-conserving, correlated stochastic integration scheme that achieves an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(dt^3)$. We benchmark the method with both a simple one-dimensional model to test its accuracy and a realistic 40-atom cell of SrTiO3 under THz laser pump, paving the way for simulations of ultrafast THz-Xray pump-probe spectroscopy like those performed in synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>
