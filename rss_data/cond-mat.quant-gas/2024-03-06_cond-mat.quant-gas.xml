      <title>Two Ultracold Atoms in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Box Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering and two-body bound states of two ultracold atoms in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) confinement, with the confinement potential being an infinite square well (box potential) in the transverse ($z$-) direction, and the motion of the atoms in the $x$-$y$ plane being free. Specifically, we calculate the effective 2D scattering length and 2D effective range of the low-energy scattering, as well as the energy and the transverse-excited-mode probability of the bound states. Comparing these results with those obtained under a harmonic transverse confinement potential, we find that in most of the cases the 2D effective range for the box confinement is approximately 0.28 of the one for the harmonic confinement. Moreover, the transverse-excited-mode probability of the bound states for the box confinement is also much lower than the one for the harmonic confinement. These results suggest that the transverse excitation in the box confinement is notably weaker than the one in a harmonic confinement. Therefore, achieving quasi-2D ultracold gases well-described by pure-2D effective models, particularly those with 2D contact interaction, is more feasible through box confinement. Our results are helpful for the quantum simulation of 2D many-body physics with ultracold atoms, e.g., the suppression of 2D effective range may lead to an enhancement of quantum anomaly in two-dimensional Fermi Gases. Additionally, our calculation method is applicable to the two-body problems of ultracold atoms in other types of quasi-2D confinements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced many-body quantum scars from the non-Hermitian Fock skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian pumping. Here we show that in a wide class of kinetically constrained many-body systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice with laser-induced loss. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons Across an Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Thouless pumping is an exciting frontier of topological physics. While recent works have revealed the quantized motion of solitons in Thouless pumps, the interplay between the topology, nonlinearity and disorder remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping of solitons in the presence of an impurity in the context of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Using both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and Lagrangian variational approach, we analyze the interaction between a moving soliton and an impurity. Without the pump, the soliton can pass through a light impurity, but gets trapped by the impurity with large mass. In marked contrast, we find the soliton in Thouless pumps can always transit through the impurity, and its motion is topologically quantized. Our result explicitly showcases the robustness of topological soliton pumping against microscopic imperfections, and opens a new perspective in the information processing with solitons.</description>

      <title>Ab initio simulation of the universal properties of unitary Fermi gas in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chang and Bertsch [Phys. Rev. A 76, 021603(R) (2007)] proposed a simple formula for the ground state energy of a unitary Fermi gas in a harmonic trap, based on their Green's function Monte Carlo simulations of up to 22 fermions, combined with general assumptions about the universal thermodynamic behavior of the unitary Fermi gas. In this work, we perform the ab initio simulations of the ground state energy of up to one hundred fermions using the fictitious identical particle method to overcome the Fermion sign problem, and we find that the formula proposed by Chang and Bertsch remains highly accurate. Since the number of fermions we simulate is much larger than that simulated by Chang and Bertsch when they proposed the formula, our work provides strong evidence for the universal validity of the formula. Our work demonstrates that fictitious identical particles provide a valuable tool for the ab initio simulations of ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Phases of Dipolar Gases through Quasicrystalline Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of frustration on extended supersolid states is a largely unexplored subject in the realm of cold-atom systems. In this work, we explore the impact of quasicrystalline lattices on the supersolid phases of dipolar bosons. Our findings reveal that weak quasicrystalline lattices can induce a variety of modulated phases, merging the inherent solid pattern with a quasiperiodic decoration induced by the external potential. As the lattice becomes stronger, we observe a super quasicrystal phase and a Bose glass phase. Our results, supported by a detailed discussion on experimental feasibility using dysprosium atoms and quasicrystalline optical lattice potentials, open a new avenue in the exploration of long-range interacting quantum systems in aperiodic environments. We provide a solid foundation for future experimental investigations, potentially confirming our theoretical predictions and contributing profoundly to the field of quantum gases in complex external potentials.</description>

      <title>Bell correlations of a thermal fully-connected spin chain in a vicinity of a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell correlations are among the most exotic phenomena through which quantum mechanics manifests itself. Their presence signals that the system can violate the postulates of local realism, once believed to be the nonnegotiable property of the physical world. The importance of Bell correlations from this fundamental point of view is even straightened by their applications -- ranging from quantum cryptography through quantum metrology to quantum computing. Hence it is of growing interest to characterize the ``Bell content'' of complex, scalable many-body systems. Here we perform the detailed analysis of the character and strength of many-body Bell correlations in interacting multi-qubit systems with particle-exchange symmetry. Such configuration can be mapped onto an effective Schr\"odinger-like equation, which allows for precise analytical predictions. We show that in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, these correlations quickly become so strong that only a fraction of qubits remains uncorrelated. We also identify the threshold temperature, which, once overpassed, empowers thermal fluctuations that destroy Bell correlations in the system. We hope that the approach presented here, due to its universality, could be useful for the upcoming research on genuinely nonclassical Bell-correlated complex systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive power of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory based on Renormalization Group throughout the BCS-BEC crossover in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on 2D superconductors allow the characterization of the critical temperature and of the phase diagram across the BCS-BEC crossover as a function of density. We obtain from these experiments the microscopic parameters of the superconducting state at low temperatures by the BCS mean-field approach. For Li$_x$ZrNCl, the extracted parameters are used to evaluate the superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical temperature throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, by implementing the corresponding Renormalization Group (RG) approach. In this way, we make a quantitative test of the predictive power of the BKT theory for evaluating the critical temperature. The RG flow equations turn out to give a sizable renormalization of the phase stiffness and of the critical temperature, which is crucial to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the BKT theory and the experiments, in particular in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. We predict the temperature range where phase stiffness renormalization can be measured in Li$_x$ZrNCl across the BCS-BEC crossover. Contrary to other microscopic theories of superconductivity, we find that the BKT theory can be exploited to evaluate quantitatively the critical temperature of 2D superconductors in different pairing regimes.</description>

      <title>Critical magnetic flux for Weyl points in the three-dimensional Hofstadter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the band structure of the three-dimensional Hofstadter model on cubic lattices, with an isotropic magnetic field oriented along the diagonal of the cube with flux $\Phi=2 \pi \cdot m /n$, where $m,n$ are co-prime integers. Using reduced exact diagonalization in momentum space, we show that, at fixed $m$, there exists an integer $n(m)$ associated with a specific value of the magnetic flux, that we denote by $\Phi_c(m) \equiv 2 \pi \cdot m/n(m)$, separating two different regimes. The first one, for fluxes $\Phi&lt;\Phi_c(m)$, is characterized by complete band overlaps, while the second one, for $\Phi&gt;\Phi_c(m)$, features isolated band touching points in the density of states and Weyl points between the $m$- and the $(m+1)$-th bands. In the Hasegawa gauge, the minimum of the $(m+1)$-th band abruptly moves at the critical flux $\Phi_c(m)$ from $k_z=0$ to $k_z=\pi$. We then argue that the limit for large $m$ of $\Phi_c(m)$ exists and it is finite: $\lim_{m\to \infty} \Phi_c(m) \equiv \Phi_c$. Our estimate is $\Phi_c/2\pi=0.1296(1)$. Based on the values of $n(m)$ determined for integers $m\leq60$, we propose a mathematical conjecture for the form of $\Phi_c(m)$ to be used in the large-$m$ limit. The asymptotic critical flux obtained using this conjecture is $\Phi_c^{{\rm (conj)}}/2\pi=7/54$.</description>

      <title>Quantum superpositions of current states in Rydberg-atom networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol based on the GRAPE algorithm to engineer quantum current states. Besides current states characterized by a single winding number, our approach allow to access superposition of quantum current states. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method to realize tunable quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our scheme uses a two-photon Raman transition and transformation to the spin-rotating frame. We investigate the properties of the model including only the DMI and Zeeman energy, which can be experimentally realized in our scheme. We show that the model accommodates exact and asymptotic quantum many-body scars exhibiting nonergodic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects and fragmented condensates in an integrable dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>
