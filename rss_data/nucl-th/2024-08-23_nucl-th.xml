      <title>Exploring isospin-nonconserving effects in the upper $fp$ shell with new mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear mass measurements have recently been extended conspicuously to proton-rich region in the upper $fp$ shell. The new data are utilized to study isospin symmetry breaking phenomena}using Coulomb displacement energy (CDE) and triplet displacement energy (TDE) as probes. The new mass data, either measured for the first time or with greatly improved accuracy, removed several previously found ``anomalies" in the systematical behavior in the $fp$ shell. Remarkably, more regular odd-even staggering patterns can be established in both CDE and TDE, calling for a uniform explanation in terms of isospin-nonconserving (INC) forces across the $sd$, $f_{7/2}$, and upper $fp$ shells. By extending the large-scale shell-model calculation [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{110}, 172505 (2013)] to the upper $fp$-shell region, we found that, in order to describe the new data, the same INC force is required as previously used for the $f_{7/2}$ shell. Especially, we propose the $T=1$ TDE for those triplet nuclei, that have $pp$, $nn$, and $pn$ pairs on top of a common even-even $N=Z$ core, to be a good indicator for the isotensor component of isospin violating interactions, which is estimated here to be 150 keV.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-extensive (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic model for multi-particle production processes, NEX-CLVisc, is developed in the framework of CLVisc where the viscous corrections are turned off. It assumes that the non-extensive effects consistently exist in the initial conditions set by the optical Glauber model, the equation of state and the hadron kinetic freeze-out procedure. The model is then applied to simulate the pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$) distribution, the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra and the $p_{\rm T}$-differential elliptic flow ($v_2$) of charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. It is found that the model can reasonably well reproduce the experimental data of the $\eta$ distribution and the charged-particle spectra in a $p_{\rm T}$ range up to 6-8 GeV/c. When compared with the ideal hydrodynamic model, the $p_{\rm T}$-differential $v_2$ of charged particles is suppressed in the NEX-CLVisc model, which is similar to that observed in the viscous hydrodynamic model. Moreover, due to the lack of the viscous corrections and the event-by-event fluctuation, the model can only describe the $p_{\rm T}$-differential $v_2$ up to 4 GeV/c, which is smaller than the applicable range for the particle $p_{\rm T}$ spectra.</description>

      <title>Layers of electron captures in the crust of accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of accreted matter onto the neutron star surface triggers exothermic reactions in the crust. The heat released as a result influences the luminosity exhibited by the X-ray transient. The most common approach to the kinetics of exothermic reactions in the crust of accreting neutron stars is to consider an infinite reaction rate. Here, we investigate accretion-related heat release in the accreted outer crust of a neutron star by including a time-dependent accretion cycle and experimentally based reaction rates in the kinetics of electron captures above the reaction threshold. A simple model was used to compute the zero temperature equation of state of a crust in which two nuclei can coexist. We solved the abundance of parent nuclei as a function of the depth in the star and the time variable using astrophysically motivated features of the accreting system. We calculated the heat release and neutrino loss associated to reactions in the outer crust. We report the existence of layers in the outer crust, which contain both parent and grand-daughter nuclei of electron captures. The reactions can occur deeper in the shell than the reaction threshold, thus releasing more heat per accreted baryon for a given accretion rate. The electron capture layers continue to exist even when the accretion has stopped. The heat sources are time- and pressure-dependent in accreting crusts of neutron stars. The total heat released is a function of astrophysical (active and quiescent time) and microscopic (reaction rate) parameters Therefore, we conclude these parameters should be considered individually and carefully for a range of different sources.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity in the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a renormalizable low-energy model for QCD in the 2SC phase of QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are the mesons (sigma and pions), quarks and diquarks. Some of the parameters of the model can be determined by expressing them in terms of the vacuum meson masses and pion decay constant using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are considered free, although they in principle can be calculated from QCD. The thermodynamic potential is calculated in a mean-field approximation taking only quark loops into account. In this approximation, we derive a set of renormalization group equations for the running masses and couplings. The solutions to these equations are used to improve the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ and thereby thermodynamic quantities. Four parameter sets are chosen and the phase diagram in the $\bar{\mu}$--$T$ (with $\bar{\mu}={1\over3}\mu_B$) plane is obtained. We also calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of $\bar{\mu}$ at vanishing temperature. For large values of $\bar{\mu}$, the speed of sound approaches the conformal limit $c_s={1\over\sqrt{3}}$ from above, in disagreement with perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral eigenfunction decomposition of a Fokker-Planck operator for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral solution method is proposed to solve a previuously developed non-equilibrium statistical model describing partial thermalization of produced charged hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thus improving the accuracy of the numerical solution. The particle's phase-space trajectories are treated as drift-diffusion stochastic process, leading to a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for the single-particle probability distribution function. The drift and diffusion coefficients are derived from the expected asymptotic states via appropriate fluctuation-dissipation relations, and the resulting FPE is then solved numerically using a spectral eigenfunction decomposition. The calculated time-dependent particle distributions are compared to Pb-Pb data from the ATLAS and ALICE collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Cluster production and the chemical freeze-out in expanding hot dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss medium effects on light cluster production in the QCD phase diagram by relating Mott transition lines to those for chemical freeze-out. In heavy-ion collisions at highest energies provided by the LHC, light cluster abundances should follow the statistical model because of low baryon densities. Chemical freeze-out in this domain is correlated with the QCD crossover transition. At low energies, in the nuclear fragmentation region, where the freeze-out interferes with the liquid-gas phase transition, self-energy and Pauli blocking effects are important. We demonstrate that at intermediate energies the chemical freeze-out line correlates with the maximum mass fraction of nuclear bound states, in particular $\alpha$ particles. In this domain, the HADES, FAIR and NICA experiments can give new insights.</description>

      <title>Quark and Gluon Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Revised and Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of small Bjorken-$x$ evolution of the gluon and flavor-singlet quark helicity distributions in the shock wave ($s$-channel) formalism. Earlier works on the subject in the same framework resulted in an evolution equation for the gluon field-strength $F^{12}$ and quark "axial current" ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$ operators (sandwiched between the appropriate light-cone Wilson lines) in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA: summing powers of $\alpha_s\,\ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant). In this work, we observe that an important mixing of the above operators with another gluon operator, $\overleftarrow{D}^i\,{D}^i$, also sandwiched between the light-cone Wilson lines (with the repeated index $i=1,2$ summed over), was missing in the previous works. This operator has the physical meaning of the sub-eikonal (covariant) phase: its contribution to helicity evolution is shown to be proportional to another sub-eikonal operator, $D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, which is related to the Jaffe-Manohar polarized gluon distribution. In this work we include this operator into small-$x$ helicity evolution, and construct a novel evolution mixing all three operators ($D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, $F^{12}$, and ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$), generalizing the previous results. We also construct closed DLA evolution equations in the large-$N_c$ and large-$N_c\&amp; N_f$ limits, with $N_c$ and $N_f$ the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively. Solving the large-$N_c$ equations numerically we obtain the following small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon helicity distributions $\Delta \Sigma$ and $\Delta G$, along with the $g_1$ structure function, \[\Delta\Sigma(x,Q^2)\sim\Delta G(x,Q^2)\sim g_1(x,Q^2)\sim\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66\,\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s\,N_c}{2\pi}}},\] in complete agreement with the earlier work by Bartels, Ermolaev and Ryskin.</description>

      <title>$B_c$ enhancement with non-thermalized bottom quarks in nuclear collisions at Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $B_c$ production in high-energy nuclear collisions in a transport approach with dissociation and regeneration at finite temperatures. Due to the rare production in p+p collisions and the strong combination of uncorrelated $c$ and $\bar b$ quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the $B_c$ yield is significantly enhanced in the nuclear collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Moreover, the centrality and momentum-dependent yield of $B_c$ sensitively reflect the thermalization degree of bottom quarks. And the newly observed experimental data favors a far from the thermal bottom quark distribution in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Observation of near-scission "polar" and "equatorial" proton emission in heavy-ion induced fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton and $\alpha$-particle energy spectra were measured in coincidence with fission fragments at different relative angles in $^{16}$O (96 MeV) + $^{232}$Th reaction. The multiplicity spectra were analyzed within the framework of a Moving Source Disentangling Analysis (MSDA) to determine contributions from different emission stages. The MSDA conclusively shows ``Near Scission Emission (NSE)" as an essential component in the multiplicity spectra. In contrast to NSE $\alpha$ particles which emit mainly perpendicular (``equatorial emission"), the NSE protons are observed to be emitted perpendicular as well as parallel (``polar emission") to the fission axis with similar intensities ($\sim$20\% for each). Thus, around 40\% of total pre-scission protons are emitted near the scission stage, whereas the same fraction for $\alpha$ particles is only around 10\%. The inevitable presence of ``polar" and ``equatorial" NSE protons in a heavy-ion induced fission has been observed for the first time. Present results open up a new avenue to study the heavy-ion induced fission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics via random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>
