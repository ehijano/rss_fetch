      <title>A kinetic Nash inequality and precise boundary behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a kinetic Nash type inequality and adapt it to a new functional inequality for functions in a kinetic Sobolev space with absorbing boundary conditions on the half-space. As an application, we address the boundary behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in the half-space. Our main result is the sharp regularity of the solution at the absorbing boundary and grazing set.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the monodomain model of cardiac electrophysiology. After an analysis of the well-posedness of the forward problem, we show that perfectly insulating regions (modeling ischemic regions in the cardiac tissue) can be uniquely determined by partial boundary measurements of the potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamics for a diffusive epidemic model with a free boundary: spreading speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spreading speed of a diffusive epidemic model proposed by Li et al. \cite{LL}, where the Stefan boundary condition is imposed at the right boundary, and the left boundary is subject to the homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann condition, respectively. A spreading-vanishing dichotomy and some sharp criteria were obtained in \cite{LL}. In this paper, when spreading happens, we not only obtain the exact spreading speed of the spreading front described by the right boundary, but derive some sharp estimates on the asymptotical behavior of solution component $(u,v)$. Our arguments depend crucially on some detailed understandings for a corresponding semi-wave problem and a steady state problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions for Semilinear Waves on Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish precise asymptotic expansions for solutions to semilinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities on asymptotically flat spacetimes. For cubic nonlinearities $a(t,x)\phi^3$, we prove $\phi(t, x) = 2c_0 t^{-2} + O(t^{-3+})$ in compact spatial regions, with $c_0$ computable. For $a(t,x)\phi^p$ with $p \geq 4$, we show $\phi(t, x) = d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, extending Price's law to the nonlinear setting. Our approach combines radiation field analysis with a generalized low-energy resolvent expansion, providing a bridge between spectral and physical space methods. These results sharpen previous decay estimates and yield complete asymptotics across the entire spacetime, including black hole backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The Landau equation in a domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the Landau equation in a bounded domain with the Maxwell reflection condition on the boundary for any (possibly smoothly position dependent) accommodation coefficient and for the full range of interaction potentials, including the Coulomb case. We establish the global existence and a constructive asymptotic decay of solutions in a close-to-equilibrium regime. This is the first existence result for a Maxwell reflection condition on the boundary and that generalizes the similar results established for the Landau equation for other geometries in \cite{GuoLandau1,GS1,GS2,MR3625186,MR4076068}. We also answer to Villani's program \cite{MR2116276,MR2407976} about constructive accurate rate of convergence to the equilibrium {(quantitative H-Theorem)} for solutions to collisional kinetic equations satisfying a priori uniform bounds. The proofs rely on the study of a suitably linear problem for which we prove that the associated operator is hypocoercive, the associated semigroup is ultracontractive, and finally that it is asymptotically stable in many weighted $L^\infty$ spaces.</description>

      <title>The natural extension to PDEs of Lie's reduction of order algorithm for ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we further consider the symmetry-based method for seeking nonlocally related systems for partial differential equations. In particular, we show that the symmetry-based method for partial differential equations is the natural extension of Lie's reduction of order algorithm for ordinary differential equations by looking at this algorithm from a different point of view. Many examples exhibit various situations that can arise.</description>

      <title>Linear waves on the expanding region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes: forward asymptotics and scattering from infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to the linear wave equation on the cosmological region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that all sufficiently regular finite-energy solutions to the linear equation possess a particular finite-order asymptotic expansion near the future boundary. Specifically, we prove that several terms in this asymptotic expansion are identically zero. This is accomplished with new weighted higher-order energy estimates that capture the global expansion of the cosmological region. Furthermore we prove existence and uniqueness of scattering solutions to the linear wave equation on the expanding region. Given two pieces of scattering data at infinity, we construct solutions that have the same asymptotics as forward solutions. The proof involves constructing asymptotic solutions to the wave equation, as well as a new weighted energy estimate that is suitable for the backward problem. This scattering result extends to a large class of expanding spacetimes, including the Kerr de Sitter family.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the soap film capillarity problem for plane boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the soap film capillarity problem, in which soap films are modeled as sets of least perimeter among those having prescribed (small) volume and satisfying a topological spanning condition. When the given boundary is the closed tubular neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of a smooth Jordan curve (or, more generally, the closed tubular neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of a smooth embedding of $\mathbb{S}^{d-2}$ in a hyperplane), we prove existence and uniqueness of classical minimizers, for which the collapsing phenomenon does not occur. We show that the boundary of the unique minimizer is the union of two symmetric smooth normal graphs over a portion of the plane; the graphs have positive constant mean curvature bounded linearly in terms of the volume parameter, and meet the boundary of the tubular neighbourhood orthogonally. Moreover, we prove uniform bounds on the sectional curvatures in order to show that the boundaries of solutions corresponding to varying volumes are ordered monotonically and produce a foliation of space by constant mean curvature hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>A Deep BSDE approximation of nonlinear integro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a hot topic. In this paper we introduce and analyse a Deep BSDE scheme for nonlinear integro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators -problems arising in e.g. stochastic control and games involving infinite activity jump-processes. The scheme is based on a stochastic forward-backward SDE representation of the solution of the PDE and (i) approximation of small jumps by a Gaussian process, (ii) simulation of the forward part, and (iii) a neural net regression for the backward part. Unlike grid-based schemes, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore suitable for high dimensional problems. The scheme is designed to be convergent even in the infinite activity/unbounded nonlocal operator case. A full convergence analysis is given and constitutes the main part of the paper.</description>

Abstract: The moderate deviation principle is achieved for a stochastic Schrodinger type equation by applying the classical Azencott method. The Friedlin-Wentzell inequality derived by this method is then used to prove the Strassen's compact law of the iterated logarithm for the equation.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to Shnirelman's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the discrete Shnirelman's inequality [Shnirelman A., 1985], which relates the $L^2$-distance of two discrete configurations of a fluid to the $L^1_tL^2_x$-norm of the vector field connecting them. Our proof is inspired by [Shnirelman A., 1985], where it was obtained $\alpha=\frac{1}{64}$ in dimension $\nu=2$, while here we get $\alpha\geq\frac{2}{7}$. Moreover we prove that $\alpha\geq\frac{1}{\nu+1}$ for any dimension $\nu\geq 3$. We point out that, even if this does not improve the bound in the continuous version, where it was proved that $\alpha\geq\frac{2}{4+\nu}$, with $\nu\geq 3$, our bound is the best one achieved for the $2$-dimensional case. Our method uses an alternative approach based on volume estimates of permutations, which count the number of maximum cubes that are moved by a permutation $P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a global well-posedness result for the 2D Muskat problem with surface tension. Given any regular enough initial data which is small in some critical space but possibly large in Lipschitz, we prove that the associated Cauchy problem has a unique global solution. Our result allows for the slope of the interface between the two fluids to be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Weak well-posedness of energy solutions to singular SDEs with supercritical distributional drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic differential equations with additive noise and distributional drift on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $d \geqslant 2$. We work in a scaling-supercritical regime using energy solutions and recent ideas for generators of singular stochastic partial differential equations. We mainly focus on divergence-free drift, but allow for scaling-critical non-divergence free perturbations. In the time-dependent divergence-free case we roughly speaking prove weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial law $\mu \ll \text{Leb}$ for drift $b \in L^p_T B^{-\gamma}_{p, 1}$ with $p \in (2, \infty]$ and $p \geqslant \frac{2}{1 -\gamma}$. For time-independent $b$ we show weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial law $\mu \ll \text{Leb}$ under certain structural assumptions on $b$ which allow local singularities such that $b \notin B^{-1}_{2 d/(d-2), 2}$, meaning that for any $p &gt; 2$ in sufficiently high dimension there exists $b \notin B^{-1}_{p, 2}$ such that weak well-posedness holds for energy solutions with drift $b$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain polynomial decay rates for $C_{0}$-semigroups, assuming that the resolvent grows polynomially at infinity in the complex right half-plane. Our results do not require the semigroup to be uniformly bounded, and for unbounded semigroups we improve upon previous results by, for example, removing a logarithmic loss on non-Hilbertian Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a local in time spatially real-analytic solution to the 2D and 3D stochastic Navier--Stokes equation driven by a spatially real-analytic multiplicative and transport noise but emanating from an initial condition that is only required to have bounded enstrophy. Under the condition that the solution is global in time, we also establish the exponential decay of the finite-dimensional Galerkin approximation, with respect to its maximum wavenumber, to the strong pathwise solution of the stochastic Navier--Stokes equation. This decay is uniform in time, uniform with respect to the initial enstropy, and uniform in the noise coefficients.</description>

Moreover, each ER-solution is rightly continuous in the standard phase space $H$ endowed with the strong convergence topology.</description>

      <title>Domain branching in micromagnetism: scaling law for the global and local energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of domain branching in a class of $(d+1)$-dimensional sharp interface models featuring the competition between an interfacial energy and a non-local field energy. Our motivation comes from branching in uniaxial ferromagnets corresponding to $d=2$, but our result also covers twinning in shape-memory alloys near an austenite-twinned-martensite interface (corresponding to $d=1$, thereby recovering a result of Conti [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 1448-1474. https://doi.org/cgkvm4 ]).
  We prove that the energy density of a minimising configuration in a large cuboid domain $Q_{L,T}=[-L,L]^d\times [0,T]$ scales like $T^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ (irrespective of the dimension $d$) if $L\gg T^{\frac{2}{3}}$. While this already provides a lot of insight into the nature of minimisers, it does not characterise their behaviour close to the top and bottom boundaries of the sample, i.e. in the region where the branching is concentrated. More significantly, we show that minimisers exhibit a self-similar behaviour near the top and bottom boundaries in a statistical sense through local energy bounds: for any minimiser in $Q_{L,T}$, the energy density in a small cuboid $Q_{\ell,t}$ centred at the top or bottom boundaries of the sample, with side lengths $\ell \gg t^{\frac{2}{3}}$, satisfies the same scaling law, that is, it is of order $t^{-\frac{2}{3}}$.</description>

      <title>On the bounded smooth solutions to exponentially stable linear nonautonomous hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate global bounded solutions of higher regularity to boundary value problems for a general linear nonautonomous first order 1D hyperbolic system in a strip. We establish the existence of such solutions under the assumption of exponential stability and certain dissipativity (or non-resonant) conditions. Our results demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of $C^1$- and $C^2$-bounded solutions, in particular, periodic and almost periodic solutions. The number of imposed dissipativity conditions is related to the regularity of solutions. This connection arises due to the nonautonomous nature of the hyperbolic system under consideration, in contrast to autonomous settings.
  In the general case of global bounded smooth solutions we assume exponential stability in $H^1$. In the case of periodic solutions, the weaker assumption of $L^2$-exponential stability proves to be sufficient.</description>

      <title>The traveling wave problem for the shallow water equations: well-posedness and the limits of vanishing viscosity and surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study solitary traveling wave solutions to a damped shallow water system, which is in general quasilinear and of mixed type. We develop a small data well-posedness theory and prove that traveling wave solutions are a generic phenomenon that persist with and without viscosity or surface tension and for all nontrivial traveling wave speeds, even when the parameters dictate that the equations are hyperbolic and have a sound speed. This theory is developed by way of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, which allows us to prove strong norm continuity of solutions with respect to the data as well as the parameters, even in the vanishing limits of viscosity and surface tension.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Normal Form and Growth of Sobolev Norm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16492v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of reducible Hamiltonian partial differential equations (PDEs) with arbitrary spatial dimensions, quantified by a quadratic polynomial with time-dependent coefficients, we present a comprehensive classification of long-term solution behaviors within Sobolev space. This classification is achieved through the utilization of Metaplectic and Schr\"odinger representations. Each pattern of Sobolev norm behavior corresponds to a specific $n-$dimensional symplectic normal form, as detailed in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
  When applied to periodically or quasi-periodically forced $n-$dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, we identify novel growth rates for the $\mathcal{H}^s-$norm as $t$ tends to infinity, such as $t^{(n-1)s}e^{\lambda st}$ (with $\lambda&gt;0$) and $t^{(2n-1)s}+ \iota t^{2ns}$ (with $\iota\geq 0$). Notably, we demonstrate that stability in Sobolev space, defined as the boundedness of the Sobolev norm, is essentially a unique characteristic of one-dimensional scenarios, as outlined in Theorem 1.3.
  As a byproduct, we discover that the growth rate of the Sobolev norm for the quantum Hamiltonian can be directly described by that of the solution to the classical Hamiltonian which exhibits the ``fastest" growth, as articulated in Theorem 1.4.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Convexity of Nonlinear Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Differential Energy Equalities for Weak Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new results for general weak solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the three-dimensional torus, without using the strong energy inequality or other regularity assumptions. Specifically, we prove two types of differential energy equalities, in which $(d/dt)\lVert u\rVert^2$ is replaced by $2\langle \partial_t u,u\rangle$ and $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}(d/dt)\lVert u_N\rVert^2$, where the $u_N$ are projections of the original weak solution $u$. We also provide a new characterization of Leray-Hopf solutions, as weak solutions having a version for which the energy is monotonically decreasing. In order to prove these results, we first prove that both $\partial_t u$ and $\Delta u$ are in $L^{4/3}(\epsilon, T; L^{6/5})$, results that were previously known only for Leray-Hopf weak solutions.</description>

      <title>A stochastic population model with hierarchic size-structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchically structured population in which the amount of resources an individual has access to is affected by individuals that are larger, and that the intake of resources by an individual only affects directly the growth rate of the individual. We formulate a deterministic model, which takes the form of a delay equation for the population birth rate. We also formulate an individual based stochastic model, and study the relationship between the two models. In particular the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model is compared to that of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. Since the quasi-stationary birth rate cannot be obtained explicitly, we derive a formula to approximate it. We show that the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model can be obtained as the large population limit of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. This relation suggests that the deterministic model is a good approximation of the stochastic model when the number of individuals is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Classification results, rigidity theorems and semilinear PDEs on Riemannian manifolds: a P-function approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to some semilinear elliptic equations on complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds and study their classification as well as the effect of their presence on the underlying manifold. When the Ricci curvature is non-negative, we prove both the classification of positive solutions to the critical equation and the rigidity for the ambient manifold. The same results are obtained when we consider solutions to the Liouville equation on Riemannian surfaces. The results are obtained via a suitable P-function whose constancy implies the classification of both the solutions and the underlying manifold. The analysis carried out on the P-function also makes it possible to classify non-negative solutions for subcritical equations on manifolds enjoying a Sobolev inequality and satisfying an integrability condition on the negative part of the Ricci curvature. Some of our results are new even in the Euclidean case.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset R^n$, $n \geq 3$, be a fixed smooth bounded domain, and let $\gamma$ be a smooth conductivity in $\overline{\Omega}$. Consider a non-zero frequency $\lambda_0$ which does not belong to the Dirichlet spectrum of $L_\gamma = -{\rm div} (\gamma \nabla \cdot)$. Then, for all $k \geq 1$, there exists an infinite number of pairs of non-isometric $C^k$ conductivities $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, which are close to $\gamma$ such that the associated DN maps at frequency $\lambda_0$ satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \Lambda_{\gamma_1,\lambda_0} = \Lambda_{\gamma_2,\lambda_0}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>On the existence of strong solutions for unsteady motions of incompressible chemically reacting generalized Newtonian fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the unsteady motion of an incompressible generalized Newtonian fluid with chemical reactions. The system consists of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations with power-law type viscosity with a power-law index depending on the concentration, and the convection-diffusion equation which describes chemical concentration. This system of partial differential equations arises in the mathematical models describing the synovial fluid which can be found in the cavities of movable joints. We prove the existence of a global strong solution for the two and three-dimensional spatially periodic domain, provided that the power-law index is greater than or equal to $(d+2)/2$ where $d$ is the dimension of the spatial domain. Moreover, we also prove that such a solution is unique under the further assumption that $p^+ &lt; \frac{3}{2} p^-$ for the two-dimensional case and $p^+ &lt; \frac{7}{6}p^-$ for the three-dimensional case, where $p^-$ and $p^+$ are the lower and upper bounds of the power-law index $p(\cdot)$ respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>

      <title>On the local solvability and stability of the partial inverse problems for the non-self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville operators with a discontinuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse spectral problems for the Sturm-Liouville operators on [0,1] with complex coefficients and a discontinuity at $x=a\in(0,1)$. Assume that the potential on (a,1) and some parameters in the discontinuity and boundary conditions are given. We recover the potential on (0,a) and the other parameters from the eigenvalues. This is the so-called partial inverse problem. The local solvability and stability of the partial inverse problems are obtained for $a\in(0,1)$, in which the error caused by the given partial potential is considered. As a by-product, we also obtain two new uniqueness theorems for the partial inverse problem.</description>
