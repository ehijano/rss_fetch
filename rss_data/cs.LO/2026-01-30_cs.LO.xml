      <title>How Expressive Are Graph Neural Networks in the Presence of Node Identifiers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a widely used class of machine learning models for graph-structured data, based on local aggregation over neighbors. GNNs have close connections to logic. In particular, their expressive power is linked to that of modal logics and bounded-variable logics with counting. In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers? We provide answers for various classes of GNNs with local max- or sum-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Incremental Fingerprinting in an Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network protocol fingerprinting is used to identify a protocol implementation by analyzing its input-output behavior. Traditionally, fingerprinting operates under a closed-world assumption, where models of all implementations are assumed to be available. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice. When this assumption does not hold, fingerprinting results in numerous misclassifications without indicating that a model for an implementation is missing. Therefore, we introduce an open-world variant of the fingerprinting problem, where not all models are known in advance. We propose an incremental fingerprinting approach to solve the problem by combining active automata learning with closed-world fingerprinting. Our approach quickly determines whether the implementation under consideration matches an available model using fingerprinting and conformance checking. If no match is found, it learns a new model by exploiting the structure of available models. We prove the correctness of our approach and improvements in asymptotic complexity compared to naive baselines. Moreover, experimental results on a variety of protocols demonstrate a significant reduction in misclassifications and interactions with these black-boxes.</description>

      <title>The Leibniz adjunction in homotopy type theory, with an application to simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory and equips types with a notion of directed morphisms. A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \in \{1, 2\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Universal quantification makes automatic structures hard to decide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic structures are first-order structures whose universe and relations can be represented as regular languages. It follows from the standard closure properties of regular languages that the first-order theory of an automatic structure is decidable. While existential quantifiers can be eliminated in linear time by application of a homomorphism, universal quantifiers are commonly eliminated via the identity $\forall{x}. \Phi \equiv \neg (\exists{x}. \neg \Phi)$. If $\Phi$ is represented in the standard way as an NFA, a priori this approach results in a doubly exponential blow-up. However, the recent literature has shown that there are classes of automatic structures for which universal quantifiers can be eliminated by different means without this blow-up by treating them as first-class citizens and not resorting to double complementation. While existing lower bounds for some classes of automatic structures show that a singly exponential blow-up is unavoidable when eliminating a universal quantifier, it is not known whether there may be better approaches that avoid the na\"ive doubly exponential blow-up, perhaps at least in restricted settings.
  In this paper, we answer this question negatively and show that there is a family of NFA representing automatic relations for which the minimal NFA recognising the language after eliminating a single universal quantifier is doubly exponential, and deciding whether this language is empty is EXPSPACE-complete.
  The techniques underlying our EXPSPACE lower bound further enable us to establish new lower bounds for some fragments of B\"uchi arithmetic with a fixed number of quantifier alternations.</description>

      <title>Duality theory and representations for distributive quasi relation algebras and DInFL-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop dualities for complete perfect distributive quasi relation algebras and complete perfect distributive involutive FL-algebras. The duals are partially ordered frames with additional structure. These frames are analogous to the atom structures used to study relation algebras. We also extend the duality from complete perfect algebras to all algebras, using so-called doubly-pointed frames with a Priestley topology.
  We then turn to the representability of these algebras as lattices of binary relations. Some algebras can be realised as term subreducts of representable relation algebras and are hence representable. We provide a detailed account of known representations for all algebras up to size six.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Defining and Separating Fixpoint Formulae in Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modal separability for modal fixpoint formulae is the problem to decide for two given modal fixpoint formulae $\varphi,\varphi'$ whether there is a modal formula $\psi$ that separates them, in the sense that $\varphi\models\psi$ and $\psi\models\neg\varphi'$. We study modal separability and its special case modal definability over various classes of models, such as arbitrary models, finite models, trees, and models of bounded outdegree. Our main results are that modal separability is PSpace-complete over words, that is, models of outdegree $\leq 1$, ExpTime-complete over unrestricted and over binary models, and TwoExpTime-complete over models of outdegree bounded by some $d\geq 3$. Interestingly, this latter case behaves fundamentally different from the other cases also in that modal logic does not enjoy the Craig interpolation property over this class. Motivated by this we study also the induced interpolant existence problem as a special case of modal separability, and show that it is coNExpTime-complete and thus harder than validity in the logic. Besides deciding separability, we also provide algorithms for the effective construction of separators. Finally, we consider in a case study the extension of modal fixpoint formulae by graded modalities and investigate separability by modal formulae and graded modal formulae.</description>

      <title>Computing Supported Models via Transformation to Stable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) with stable model semantics has proven highly effective for knowledge representation and reasoning. However, the minimality requirement of stable models can be restrictive for applications requiring exploration of non-minimal but logically consistent solution spaces. Supported models, introduced by Apt, Blair, and Walker in 1988, relax this minimality constraint while maintaining a support condition ensuring every true atom is justified by some rule.
  Despite their theoretical significance, supported models lack practical computational tools integrated with modern ASP solvers. We present a novel transformation-based method enabling computation of supported models using standard ASP infrastructure. Our approach transforms any ground logic program into an equivalent program whose stable models correspond exactly to the supported models of the original program. We implement this transformation for Clingo, providing the first practical tool for computing supported models with state-of-the-art ASP solvers.
  We demonstrate applications in software verification, medical diagnosis, and planning where supported models enable valuable exploratory reasoning capabilities beyond those provided by stable models. We also provide an empirical evaluation to justify the practical utility of our approach compared to established methods. Our implementation is publicly available and compatible with standard ASP syntax.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for distant Bang calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximation semantics capture the observable behaviour of {\lambda}-terms, with B\"ohm Trees and Taylor Expansion standing as two central paradigms. Although conceptually different, these notions are related via the Commutation Theorem, which links the Taylor expansion of a term to that of its B\"ohm tree. These notions are well understood in Call-by-Name {\lambda}-calculus and have been more recently introduced in Call-by-Value settings. Since these two evaluation strategies traditionally require separate theories, a natural next step is to seek a unified setting for approximation semantics. The Bang-calculus offers exactly such a framework, subsuming both CbN and CbV through linear-logic translations while providing robust rewriting properties. However, its approximation semantics is yet to be fully developed. In this work, we develop the approximation semantics for dBang, the Bang-calculus with explicit substitutions and distant reductions. We define B\"ohm trees and Taylor expansion within dBang and establish their fundamental properties. Our results subsume and generalize Call-By-Name and Call-By-Value through their translations into Bang, offering a single framework that uniformly captures infinitary and resource-sensitive semantics across evaluation strategies.</description>

      <title>SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Think Locally, Explain Globally: Graph-Guided LLM Investigations via Local Reasoning and Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.
  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.</description>
