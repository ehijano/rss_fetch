      <title>The Whitehead group and stably trivial $G$-smoothings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A closed manifold $M$ of dimension at least $5$ has only finitely many smooth structures. Moreover, smooth structures of $M$ are in bijection with smooth structures of $M\times\mathbb{R}$. Both of these statements are false equivariantly. In this paper, we use controlled $h$-cobordisms to construct infinitely many $G$-smoothings of a $G$-manifold $X$. Moreover, these $G$-smoothings are isotopic after taking a product with $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Aganagic's invariant is Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the Coulomb branch of a quiver gauge theory, there is a family of functions parameterized by choices of points in the punctured plane. Aganagic has predicted that Khovanov homology can be recovered from the braid group action on Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from monodromy in said space of potentials. These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to contain a certain (combinatorially defined) category on which Webster had previously constructed a (combinatorially defined) braid group action from which the Khovanov homology can be recovered.
  Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment intertwines said combinatorially defined braid group action with the braid group action arising naturally from monodromy. This provides a mathematical verification that Aganagic's proposal gives a symplectic construction of Khovanov homology -- with both gradings, and over the integers.</description>

      <title>A topological constraint on clean Lagrangian intersections from $\mathbb{Q}$-valued augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a knot $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, consider its conormal bundle $L_K$ in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that if $K$ is the connected sum $K' \# 3_1$ of an arbitrary knot $K'$ and the trefoil knot $3_1$ (or its mirror), then there is no compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\varphi(L_K)$ and the zero section $\mathbb{R}^3$ intersect cleanly along the unknot in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For the proof, we utilize the knot DGA, whose homology was proved to be isomorphic to the knot contact homology by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},U^{\pm}]$. We discover a certain algebraic constraint imposed on any augmentation of the knot DGA of $K = K'\# 3_1$ to a field $\mathbf{k}$. This constraint is non-trivial for $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{Q}$ and plays a key role in the proof, but trivial if $\mathbf{k}$ is quadratically closed or if an augmentation factors through the knot DGA with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}]$ obtained by setting $U=1$.</description>

      <title>An explicit description of the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics of Guenancia-Hamenst\"{a}dt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine and Premoselli (FP) constructed the first examples of manifolds that do not admit a locally symmetric metric but do admit a negatively curved Einstein metric. The manifolds here are hyperbolic branched covers like those used by Gromov and Thurston, and the construction of their model Einstein metric is a variation of the hyperbolic metric written in polar coordinates. Very recently, Guenancia and Hamenst\"{a}dt (GH) proved the existence of the first examples of manifolds that are not locally symmetric but admit a negatively curved K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic branched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo. In this article we generalize the construction of FP to the complex hyperbolic setting and show that this yields a negatively curved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the metric of GH.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial zeta functions counting triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute special values of certain combinatorial zeta functions counting geodesic paths in the (n-1)-skeleton of a triangulation of a n-dimensional manifold. We show that they carry a topological meaning. As such, we recover the first Betti number and L2-Betti number of compact manifolds, and the linking number of pairs of null-homologous knots in a 3-manifold. The tool to relate the two sides (counting geodesics/topological invariants) are random walks on higher dimensional skeleta of the triangulation.</description>

      <title>The boundary of the Milnor fibre and a linking invariant of finitely determined germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The image of a finitely determined holomorphic germ $\Phi$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}^3$ defines a hypersurface singularity $(X,0)$, which is in general non-isolated. We show that the diffeomorphism type of the boundary of the Milnor fibre $\partial F$ of $X$ is a topological invariant of the germ $\Phi$. We establish a correspondence between the gluing coefficients (so-called vertical indices) used in the construction of $\partial F$ and a linking invariant $L$ of the associated sphere immersion introduced by T. Ekholm and A. Sz\H{u}cs. For this we provide a direct proof of the equivalence of the different definitions of $L$. Since $L$ can be expressed in terms of the cross cap number $C(\Phi)$ and the triple point number $T(\Phi)$ of a stable deformation of $\Phi$, we obtain a relation between these invariants and the vertical indices. This is illustrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>Ghost polygons, Poisson bracket and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space of Anosov representations of a surface group in a semisimple group, which is an open set in the character variety, admits many more natural functions than the regular functions. We will study in particular length functions and, correlation functions. Our main result is a formula that computes the Poisson bracket of those functions using some combinatorial devices called {\em ghost polygons} and {\em ghost bracket} encoded in a formal algebra called {\em ghost algebra} related in some cases to the swapping algebra introduced by the second author. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that the set of those functions -- length and correlation -- is stable under the Poisson bracket. We give two applications: firstly in the presence of positivity we prove the convexity of length functions, generalising a result of Kerckhoff in Teichm\"uller space, secondly we exhibit subalgebras of commuting functions. An important tool is the study of {\em uniformly hyperbolic bundles} which is a generalisation of Anosov representations beyond periodicity.</description>

      <title>The geometry of Deroin-Tholozan representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a way to build hyperbolic spheres with conical singularities by gluing together simple building blocks. Our construction provides good control over the holonomy of the resulting hyperbolic cone sphere. In particular, it can be used to realize any Deroin-Tholozan (DT) representation as the holonomy of a hyperbolic cone sphere. Our construction is inspired by the correspondence between DT representations and chains of triangles in the hyperbolic plane. It gives a geometric interpretation of certain action-angle coordinates on the space of DT representations, which come from this correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1801.00191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that the complex of Soergel bimodules associated with the full twist braid is categorically diagonalizable, for any finite Coxeter group. This utilizes the theory of categorical diagonalization introduced earlier by the authors. We prove our conjecture in type $A$, and as a result we obtain a categorification of the Young idempotents.</description>

Abstract: We describe the action of the mapping class group $M(g,n)$ on the fundamental group of $T_{g,n}$, a compact orientable topological surface of positive genus $g$ with $n$ marked points. This is achieved by computing the image of the generators of $M(g,n)$ as outer automorphisms of the fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Bounded projections to the $\mathcal{Z}$-factor graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a free product $G = A_1 * A_2* \cdots * A_k * F_N$, where each of the groups $A_i$ is torsion-free and $F_N$ is a free group of rank $N$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the deformation space associated to this free product decomposition. We show that the diameter of the projection of the subset of $\mathcal{O}$ where a given element has bounded length to the $\mathcal{Z}$-factor graph is bounded, where the diameter bound depends only on the length bound. This relies on an analysis of the boundary of $G$ as a hyperbolic group relative to the collection of subgroups $A_i$ together with a given non-peripheral cyclic subgroup. The main theorem is new even in the case that $G = F_N$, in which case $\mathcal{O}$ is the Culler-Vogtmann outer space. In a future paper, we will apply this theorem to study the geometry of free group extensions.</description>

      <title>Low Morse index for the systole function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $k\ge0$, all critical points for the systole function and the $\text{sys}_T$ functions in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ have index at least $k$, for all but finitely many pairs $(g,n)$. This implies that the lowest Morse index can be bounded from below by a positive number that goes to infinity as the dimension of the moduli space increases. We conclude by Morse theory that all the rational (co)homology of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of degree at most $k$ comes from the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ for all but finitely many pairs $(g,n)$.
  In particular, we show that there exists a universal constant $C&gt;0$, such that the lowest Morse index is at least $C\log\log(-\chi+1)$. Developing the theorems, we also obtain an explicit upper bound on the cardinality of a $j$-system on a $(g,n)$-surface.</description>
