      <title>Distilling interpretable causal trees from causal forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods for estimating treatment effect heterogeneity promise greater flexibility than existing methods that test a few pre-specified hypotheses. However, one problem these methods can have is that it can be challenging to extract insights from complicated machine learning models. A high-dimensional distribution of conditional average treatment effects may give accurate, individual-level estimates, but it can be hard to understand the underlying patterns; hard to know what the implications of the analysis are. This paper proposes the Distilled Causal Tree, a method for distilling a single, interpretable causal tree from a causal forest. This compares well to existing methods of extracting a single tree, particularly in noisy data or high-dimensional data where there are many correlated features. Here it even outperforms the base causal forest in most simulations. Its estimates are doubly robust and asymptotically normal just as those of the causal forest are.</description>

      <title>Distributional Difference-in-Differences Models with Multiple Time Periods: A Monte Carlo Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are often interested in evaluating the impact of a policy on the entire (or specific parts of the) distribution of the outcome of interest. In this paper, I provide a practical toolkit to recover the whole counterfactual distribution of the untreated potential outcome for the treated group in non-experimental settings with staggered treatment adoption by generalizing the existing quantile treatment effects on the treated (QTT) estimator proposed by Callaway and Li (2019). Besides the QTT, I consider different approaches that anonymously summarize the quantiles of the distribution of the outcome of interest (such as tests for stochastic dominance rankings) without relying on rank invariance assumptions. The finite-sample properties of the estimator proposed are analyzed via different Monte Carlo simulations. Despite being slightly biased for relatively small sample sizes, the proposed method's performance increases substantially when the sample size increases.</description>

      <title>Application of Superconducting Technology in the Electricity Industry: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Government Subsidy Policies and Power Company Equipment Upgrade Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of "LK-99," a novel material developed by a Korean research team, on the power equipment industry. Using evolutionary game theory, the interactions between governmental subsidies and technology adoption by power companies are modeled. A key innovation of this research is the introduction of sensitivity analyses concerning time delays and initial subsidy amounts, which significantly influence the strategic decisions of both government and corporate entities. The findings indicate that these factors are critical in determining the rate of technology adoption and the efficiency of the market as a whole. Due to existing data limitations, the study offers a broad overview of likely trends and recommends the inclusion of real-world data for more precise modeling once the material demonstrates room-temperature superconducting characteristics. The research contributes foundational insights valuable for future policy design and has significant implications for advancing the understanding of technology adoption and market dynamics.</description>
