      <title>Recognizing Everything from All Modalities at Once: Grounded Multimodal Universal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of information extraction (IE), tasks across a wide range of modalities and their combinations have been traditionally studied in isolation, leaving a gap in deeply recognizing and analyzing cross-modal information. To address this, this work for the first time introduces the concept of grounded Multimodal Universal Information Extraction (MUIE), providing a unified task framework to analyze any IE tasks over various modalities, along with their fine-grained groundings. To tackle MUIE, we tailor a multimodal large language model (MLLM), Reamo, capable of extracting and grounding information from all modalities, i.e., recognizing everything from all modalities at once. Reamo is updated via varied tuning strategies, equipping it with powerful capabilities for information recognition and fine-grained multimodal grounding. To address the absence of a suitable benchmark for grounded MUIE, we curate a high-quality, diverse, and challenging test set, which encompasses IE tasks across 9 common modality combinations with the corresponding multimodal groundings. The extensive comparison of Reamo with existing MLLMs integrated into pipeline approaches demonstrates its advantages across all evaluation dimensions, establishing a strong benchmark for the follow-up research. Our resources are publicly released at https://haofei.vip/MUIE.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in combining LLMs with multimodal learning. Previous surveys of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mainly focus on understanding. This survey elaborates on multimodal generation across different domains, including image, video, 3D, and audio, where we highlight the notable advancements with milestone works in these fields. Specifically, we exhaustively investigate the key technical components behind methods and multimodal datasets utilized in these studies. Moreover, we dig into tool-augmented multimodal agents that can use existing generative models for human-computer interaction. Lastly, we also comprehensively discuss the advancement in AI safety and investigate emerging applications as well as future prospects. Our work provides a systematic and insightful overview of multimodal generation, which is expected to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.

      <title>JIGMARK: A Black-Box Approach for Enhancing Image Watermarks against Diffusion Model Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the vulnerability of image watermarks to diffusion-model-based image editing, a challenge exacerbated by the computational cost of accessing gradient information and the closed-source nature of many diffusion models. To address this issue, we introduce JIGMARK. This first-of-its-kind watermarking technique enhances robustness through contrastive learning with pairs of images, processed and unprocessed by diffusion models, without needing a direct backpropagation of the diffusion process. Our evaluation reveals that JIGMARK significantly surpasses existing watermarking solutions in resilience to diffusion-model edits, demonstrating a True Positive Rate more than triple that of leading baselines at a 1% False Positive Rate while preserving image quality. At the same time, it consistently improves the robustness against other conventional perturbations (like JPEG, blurring, etc.) and malicious watermark attacks over the state-of-the-art, often by a large margin. Furthermore, we propose the Human Aligned Variation (HAV) score, a new metric that surpasses traditional similarity measures in quantifying the number of image derivatives from image editing.</description>

      <title>Gear-NeRF: Free-Viewpoint Rendering and Tracking with Motion-aware Spatio-Temporal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensions of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to model dynamic scenes have enabled their near photo-realistic, free-viewpoint rendering. Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</description>

      <title>ReFiNe: Recursive Field Networks for Cross-modal Multi-scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common trade-offs of state-of-the-art methods for multi-shape representation (a single model "packing" multiple objects) involve trading modeling accuracy against memory and storage. We show how to encode multiple shapes represented as continuous neural fields with a higher degree of precision than previously possible and with low memory usage. Key to our approach is a recursive hierarchical formulation that exploits object self-similarity, leading to a highly compressed and efficient shape latent space. Thanks to the recursive formulation, our method supports spatial and global-to-local latent feature fusion without needing to initialize and maintain auxiliary data structures, while still allowing for continuous field queries to enable applications such as raytracing. In experiments on a set of diverse datasets, we provide compelling qualitative results and demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-scene reconstruction and compression results with a single network per dataset.</description>

      <title>VidMuse: A Simple Video-to-Music Generation Framework with Long-Short-Term Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 190K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment. The code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/ZeyueT/VidMuse/.</description>

      <title>Token-Level Contrastive Learning with Modality-Aware Prompting for Multimodal Intent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition aims to leverage diverse modalities such as expressions, body movements and tone of speech to comprehend user's intent, constituting a critical task for understanding human language and behavior in real-world multimodal scenarios. Nevertheless, the majority of existing methods ignore potential correlations among different modalities and own limitations in effectively learning semantic features from nonverbal modalities. In this paper, we introduce a token-level contrastive learning method with modality-aware prompting (TCL-MAP) to address the above challenges. To establish an optimal multimodal semantic environment for text modality, we develop a modality-aware prompting module (MAP), which effectively aligns and fuses features from text, video and audio modalities with similarity-based modality alignment and cross-modality attention mechanism. Based on the modality-aware prompt and ground truth labels, the proposed token-level contrastive learning framework (TCL) constructs augmented samples and employs NT-Xent loss on the label token. Specifically, TCL capitalizes on the optimal textual semantic insights derived from intent labels to guide the learning processes of other modalities in return. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves remarkable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ablation analyses demonstrate the superiority of the modality-aware prompt over the handcrafted prompt, which holds substantial significance for multimodal prompt learning. The codes are released at https://github.com/thuiar/TCL-MAP.</description>

      <title>CMFeed: A Benchmark Dataset for Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (CMFeed) dataset enables the generation of sentiment-controlled feedback from multimodal inputs. It contains images, text, human comments, comments' metadata and sentiment labels. Existing datasets for related tasks such as multimodal summarization, visual question answering, visual dialogue, and sentiment-aware text generation do not incorporate training models using human-generated outputs and their metadata, a gap that CMFeed addresses. This capability is critical for developing feedback systems that understand and replicate human-like spontaneous responses. Based on the CMFeed dataset, we define a novel task of controllable feedback synthesis to generate context-aware feedback aligned with the desired sentiment. We propose a benchmark feedback synthesis system comprising encoder, decoder, and controllability modules. It employs transformer and Faster R-CNN networks to extract features and generate sentiment-specific feedback, achieving a sentiment classification accuracy of 77.23%, which is 18.82% higher than models not leveraging the dataset's unique controllability features. Additionally, we incorporate a similarity module for relevance assessment through rank-based metrics.</description>

      <title>ConsistencyTTA: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Text-to-Audio Generation with Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are instrumental in text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Unfortunately, they suffer from slow inference due to an excessive number of queries to the underlying denoising network per generation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce ConsistencyTTA, a framework requiring only a single non-autoregressive network query, thereby accelerating TTA by hundreds of times. We achieve so by proposing "CFG-aware latent consistency model," which adapts consistency generation into a latent space and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) into model training. Moreover, unlike diffusion models, ConsistencyTTA can be finetuned closed-loop with audio-space text-aware metrics, such as CLAP score, to further enhance the generations. Our objective and subjective evaluation on the AudioCaps dataset shows that compared to diffusion-based counterparts, ConsistencyTTA reduces inference computation by 400x while retaining generation quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>The Revolution of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connecting text and visual modalities plays an essential role in generative intelligence. For this reason, inspired by the success of large language models, significant research efforts are being devoted to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models can seamlessly integrate visual and textual modalities, while providing a dialogue-based interface and instruction-following capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent visual-based MLLMs, analyzing their architectural choices, multimodal alignment strategies, and training techniques. We also conduct a detailed analysis of these models across a wide range of tasks, including visual grounding, image generation and editing, visual understanding, and domain-specific applications. Additionally, we compile and describe training datasets and evaluation benchmarks, conducting comparisons among existing models in terms of performance and computational requirements. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, laying the groundwork for future MLLMs.</description>
