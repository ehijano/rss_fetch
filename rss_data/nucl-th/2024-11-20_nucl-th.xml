      <title>Quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter at non-zero isospin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter to non-zero isospin asymmetries by utilizing the two-component van der Waals equation with a generalized excluded volume prescription. The isospin dependence of van der Waals interaction parameters is determined by constraints on the symmetry energy, slope of the symmetry energy, and nuclear ground state properties. We find that the speed of sound has a peak for all values of the asymmetry parameter, signifying a transition to quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic matter onset density is found to have a mild dependence on isospin asymmetry, with specific details influenced by the isospin dependence of the repulsive interactions. We also incorporate leptonic degrees of freedom and explore the neutron star matter equation of state, calculating mass-radius relations and tidal properties of neutron stars. We find that quarkyonic matter supports heavy neutron stars with a maximum mass of at least 2.6 solar masses. We observe quantitatively different behavior for the excluded volume cases of isospin-blind ($b_{n}=b_{pn}$) and isospin-dependent ($b_{n} \neq b_{pn}$) repulsion, the latter being preferred by observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Charmonia Production in Hot QCD Matter and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both hot QCD matter and extremely strong electromagnetic fields are generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We employ the transport model and the equivalent photon approximation (EPA) to study charmonium hadroproduction and photoproduction in nucleus-nucleus collisions, respectively. In photoproduction, quasi-real photons may interact with the whole nucleus or individual nucleons, which is called the coherent and incoherent processes, respectively. The typical momentum of charmonium produced in two processes is located in $p_T\lesssim 1/R_A$ and $p_T\lesssim 1/R_N$, where $R_A$ and $R_N$ are the radii of nucleus and the nucleon. Both kinds of photoproduction and also hadroproduction are considered to calculate charmonium production in different transverse momentum bins, rapidity bins, and collision centralities, incorporating modifications from hot QCD matter and initial cold nuclear matter effects. Our calculations explain experimental data about charmonium nuclear modification factors and the production cross-section in ultra-peripheral collisions. Charmonium nuclear modification is far above the unit at extremely low $p_T$ ($p_T &lt; 0.1$ GeV/c) in peripheral collisions with centrality 70-90\%, attributed to coherent photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$ photo-production on nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental developments, the Pom-CQM model of the $\gamma + N \to J/\psi + N$ reaction of Lee et al. [Eur. Phys. J. A. 58, 252 (2022)] and Sakinah et al. [Phys. Rev. C. 109, 065204 (2024)] has been applied to predict the exclusive $J/\psi$ photo-production on nuclei ($A$). Within the multiple scattering theory, the calculations have been performed by including the impulse amplitude $T^{\rm IMP}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$ and the $J/\psi$-nucleus final state interaction (FSI) amplitude $T^{\rm FSI}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$. For the deuteron target, $T^{\rm IMP}_{J/\psi d,\gamma d}$ is calculated exactly using the wave function generated from the realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. It is found that, near the threshold region, the $J/\psi$ photo-production cross sections depend sensitively on the $d$-state of the deuteron wave function. The FSI amplitude $T^{\rm FSI}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$ is calculated using the first-order optical potential constructed from the $J/\psi$-$N$ scattering amplitude generated from the employed Pom-CQM model. It turns out that the FSI has significant effects in the large momentum-transfer region. By using the conventional fixed scatter approximation (FSA) and the nuclear form factors from the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) calculations of Lonardoni et al. [Phys. Rev.C. 96, 024326 (2017)], the cross sections of the $J/\psi$ photo-production on ${^4\rm He}$, ${^{16}\rm O}$, and ${^{40}\rm Ca}$ are also predicted for future experimental investigations at JLab and EIC.</description>

      <title>Preponderance of triaxial shapes in atomic nuclei predicted by the proxy-SU(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proxy-SU(3) symmetry predicts, in a parameter-free way, based only on the Pauli principle and the short-range nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, non-vanishing values of the collective variable gamma almost everywhere across the nuclear chart. Substantial triaxiality with gamma between 15 and 45 degrees is proved to be expected along horizontal and vertical stripes on the nuclear chart, covering the nucleon numbers 22-26, 34-48, 74-80, 116-124, 172-182. Empirical support for these stripes is found by collecting all even-even nuclei for which the first two excited 2+ states are known, along with the B(E2)s connecting them, as well as the second 2+ state to the ground state. The stripes are related to regions in which oblate SU(3) irreducible representations appear, bearing similarity to the appearance of triaxiality within the SU(3)* dynamical symmetry of the interacting boson model-2. Detailed comparisons of the proxy-SU(3) predictions to the data and to predictions by state-of-the-art Monte Carlo shell model calculations for deformed N=94, 96, 98 isotones in the rare earth region show good overall agreement, with the exception of Z=70 and N=94, which correspond to fully symmetric proxy-SU(3) irreps, suggesting that the latter are an artifact of the method which can be amended by considering the influence of the neighboring irreps.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Pairing Energy vs Mean Field Energy: Do They Talk To Each Other For Searching The Energy Minimum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the total binding energy (TBE) and pairing energy of Pb, Hg and Ar isotopes, as a function of the nuclear deformation. As for the nuclear model, we exploit a deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in the continuum (DRHBc), and a deformed Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus BCS model. It is found that the dependence of pairing energy on the deformation is strongly correlated to that of the mean field energy, which is obtained by subtracting the pairing energy from the TBE; in other words, the energy minimum characterized by a large negative mean field energy has a smaller negative pairing energy or, equivalently, a smaller positive pairing gap, while a stronger pairing energy is found in the region away from the minimum of the total energy. Consequently, the two energies show an anti-symmetric feature in their deformation dependence, although the energy scales are very different. Moreover, since the pairing energy has a negative sign with respect to to the pairing gap, the evolution of mean field energy follows closely that of the pairing gap. This implies that the pairing energy (or pairing gap) and the mean field energy talk to each other and work together along the potential energy curve to determine the energy minimum and/or the local minimum.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Supernovae, their Equation of State Dependence and Ejecta Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within $\sim 1$ s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as black hole supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core-collapse until $20\text{-}50$ days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a $60$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto-neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between $0.06\text{-}0.72\times 10^{51}$ erg with $21.8\text{-}23.3$ M$_\odot$ of ejecta, of which $0\text{-}0.018$ M$_\odot$ is $^{56}$Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find a more nuanced EOS dependence of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.</description>

      <title>Non-linear dynamics of jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive analytic framework for jet quenching in QCD media, based on a medium-induced parton cascade sourced by collinear virtual splittings. We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, $L$. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\alpha_s \ln (1/R)$, and $\alpha_s \ln (R / \theta_c)$, and powers of $\alpha_s L$. We briefly explore the limit of strong quenching, where analytic treatments are feasible, offering insights into the impact of parton cascades on jet quenching. These results provide guidance for future numerical simulations and analytical investigations.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c'$ and $\Omega_c$ baryons at high temperature with chiral restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masses of the singly heavy baryons (SHBs), composed of a heavy quark and a light diquark, are studied from the viewpoints of heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS) and chiral-symmetry restoration at finite temperature. We consider the light diquarks with spin-parity $J^P=0^\pm$ and $1^\pm$. Medium corrections to the SHBs are provided through the diquarks whereas the heavy quark is simply regarded as a spectator. The chiral dynamics of the diquark are described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model having (pseudo)scalar-type and (axial)vector-type four-point interactions and the six-point ones responsible for the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. The divergences are handled by means of the three-dimensional proper-time regularization with both ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs included, in order to eliminate unphysical imaginary parts. As a result, the mass degeneracies between the parity partners of all the SHBs are predicted in accordance with the chiral restoration. In particular, the HQS-doublet SHBs exhibit clear mass degeneracies due to the absence of the direct anomaly effects. We also predict a mass degeneracy of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Omega_c$ above the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\rm pc}$ of chiral restoration, which results in a peculiar mass hierarchy for positive-parity HQS-doublet SHBs where $\Xi_c'$ becomes heavier than $\Omega_c$ Besides, it is found that the decay width of $\Sigma_c\to\Lambda_c\pi$ vanishes above $T_{\rm pc}$ reflecting a closing of the threshold. The predicted modifications of masses and decay widths of the SHBs are expected to provide future heavy-ion collision experiments and lattice simulations with useful information on chiral dynamics of the diquarks.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of hadrons, nuclei, and atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of exotic hadrons have been stimulating the theoretical investigation of the internal structure of hadrons. While all hadrons are eventually composed of quarks and gluons by the strong interaction, clustering phenomena of quarks can generate hadronic molecules -- weakly bound systems of hadrons -- which are expected to emerge near two-hadron thresholds. However, it should be noted that a pure hadronic molecule is not realized, as the strong interaction induces mixing with other possible configurations. The compositeness of hadrons has been developed as a promising concept to quantitatively characterize the fraction of the hadronic molecular component. Here we summarize the modern understanding of the compositeness to study the internal structure of hadrons, and review the applications of the compositeness to various quantum systems in different energy scales, such as nuclei and atomic systems in addition to hadrons.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ evolution of dipole amplitude: forward--off-forward correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have shown that the small-$x$ evolution of the off-forward leading-log dipole scattering amplitudes, both pomeron and odderon, in the momentum space can be completely determined by the evolution of the respective forward amplitudes, with rescaled momenta. In position space, if there is translation symmetry (assumption of a large nucleus), the dipole cross section depends on the positions of quarks and anti-quarks only through their separation. The present study is an equivalent proposition in the momentum space -- where translation symmetry in momentum bifurcates the amplitudes into two translationally symmetric functions along the ${\bf k}$ line in the ${\bf k}-{\bf \Delta}$ plane. It also shows that high energy evolutions of dipole GTMDs can be achieved only by studying the evolution of dipole TMDs at small-$x$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced (pseudo-)tensor form factor (FF) is included. For experimental measurements, we explicitly derive the first exact full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections of both (anti)neutrino-nucleon and (anti)neutrino-antinucleon elastic scatterings. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame, being purely imaginary and parity-odd, is in fact related to the induced (pseudo-)tensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving system, and compared them with their light-front counterparts. We clarify the role played by Melosh rotations, and classify the origin of distortions in light-front distributions into three key sources using the lemma that we have proposed and verified in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Associated jet + electroweak gauge boson production in hadronic collisions at forward rapidities in the color-dipole $S$-matrix framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cross-section for the associated production of a jet with an electroweak gauge boson ($G = W^{\pm}, Z^0, \gamma$) at forward rapidities in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions is derived within the color - dipole $S$ - matrix framework. We present the full expressions for the differential cross-section of the $q p \rightarrow G q X$ process in the transverse momentum space, considering the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the gauge boson. We demonstrate that the final formulae can be expressed in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution and reproduce previous results for the associated jet + $\gamma$ and jet + $Z^0$ production, derived using other frameworks. Moreover, we derive the back - to - back correlation limit of the spectra and show that it can be expressed in terms of the unpolarized and linearly polarized transverse momentum gluon distributions. Our results improve the description of the inclusive jet plus color neutral particle production at forward rapidities, not far from the proton fragmentation region, in $pp$ or $pA$ collisions, and are the main ingredient to study the impact of nonlinear QCD effects in two - particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <title>Higher partial waves in femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is recently gaining more attention as a new approach complementary to scattering experiments for constraining hadron-hadron interactions. We discuss the effect of higher partial waves on the two-particle correlation function, which has been neglected in traditional formulae used in the femtoscopy analyses. We consider the partial-wave expansion of the wave function in the Koonin-Pratt formula to give the correction to the correlation function by a sum of the contributions from each partial wave. We also generalize the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula, which was originally derived for the s-wave interaction, for higher partial waves. We find a compact representation of the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula given by the backward scattering amplitude $f(\theta = \pi)$ and the Fourier-Laplace transform of the relative source function, which gives an insight into the structure of the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula and its relation to the optical theorem. We numerically demonstrate the significance of higher partial waves with resonances using the square potential well. Also, the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula turned out to be broken for higher partial waves, which suggests the importance of the centrifugal force for the higher partial waves.</description>

      <title>Angularity in Higgs boson decays via $\boldsymbol{H\to gg}$ at NNLL$'$ accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present improved predictions of a class of event-shape distributions called angularity for a contribution from an effective operator $H\to gg$ in Higgs hadronic decay that suffers from large perturbative uncertainties. In the frame of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, logarithmic terms of the distribution are resummed at NNLL$'$ accuracy, for which 2-loop constant of gluon-jet function for angularity is independently determined by a fit to fixed-order distribution at NLO corresponding to ${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha_s^2)$ relative to the Born rate. Our determination shows reasonable agreement with the value in a thesis recently released. In the fit, we use an asymptotic form with a fractional power conjectured from recoil corrections at one-loop order and it improves the accuracy of determination in positive values of angularity parameter $a$. The resummed distribution is matched to the NLO fixed-order results to make our predictions valid at all angularity values. We also discuss the first moment and subtracted moment of angularity as a function of $a$ that allow to extract information on leading and subleading nonperturbative corrections associated with gluons.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections in Super Rosenbluth Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super Rosenbluth experiments, elastic electron-proton scattering experiments that eschew traditional electron detection and opt instead for the detection of the recoiling proton, have several experimental advantages. One claimed advantage is that radiative corrections are more favorable, i.e., smaller and with less kinematic dependence. In this paper, we explore this claim by conducting Monte Carlo simulations of both Super Rosenbluth and traditional Rosenbluth experiments with different models of radiative effects. When using a model that employs the peaking approximation, we indeed confirm the reduced kinematic dependence of the radiative corrections. However, we find that more sophisticated models that avoid the peaking approximation are unable to produce numerically stable results, due to a large enhancement to the cross section for bremsstrahlung radiation from the proton when the momentum transfer, $Q^2$, approaches zero. Since this enhancement is not modelled in the peaking approximation, a more robust approach to radiative corrections in Super Rosenbluth experiments is needed.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced processes in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide quark-matter equations of state (EoS) that can be used for hadron-quark hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on the parameters of the quark-matter model. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, the speed of sound, the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kilometers in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the speed of sound squared reaches up to $c_s^2 \sim 0.6$ and the CFL gap up to $\Delta\sim250\,$MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction does not increase the maximum mass substantially. Thus we use the $2.0 M_{\odot}$ constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid-star model, demonstrating that there is room for different color-superconducting compositions. The hybrid EoSs obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 $M_\odot$. We find that these EoSs are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low to intermediate densities ($\sim 1-3\, n_{\text{sat}}$).</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>
