      <title>Explainable physics-based constraints on reinforcement learning for accelerator controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for controlling particle accelerator experiments that builds explainable physics-based constraints on agent behavior. The goal is to increase transparency and trust by letting users verify that the agent's decision-making process incorporates suitable physics. Our algorithm uses a learnable surrogate function for physical observables, such as energy, and uses them to fine-tune how actions are chosen. This surrogate can be represented by a neural network or by an interpretable sparse dictionary model. We test our algorithm on a range of particle accelerator controls environments designed to emulate the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab. By examining the mathematical form of the learned constraint function, we are able to confirm the agent has learned to use the established physics of each environment. In addition, we find that the introduction of a physics-based surrogate enables our reinforcement learning algorithms to reliably converge for difficult high-dimensional accelerator controls environments.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show experimentally that an effect of motion of ions, observed in a plasma-based accelerator, depends inversely on the plasma ion mass. The effect appears within a single wakefield event and manifests itself as a bunch tail, occurring only when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, experimentally confirmed through variations in the drive bunch charge.</description>
