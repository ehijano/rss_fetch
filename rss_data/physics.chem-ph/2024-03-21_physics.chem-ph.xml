      <title>Condensed-Phase Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular quantum chemistry has seen enormous progress in the last few decades thanks to the more advanced and sophisticated numerical techniques and computing power. Following the recent interest in extending these capabilities to condensed-phase problems, we summarize basic knowledge of condensed-phase quantum chemistry for ones with experience in molecular quantum chemistry. We highlight recent efforts in this direction, including solving the electron repulsion integrals bottleneck and implementing hybrid density functional theory and wavefunction methods, and lattice dynamics for periodic systems within atom-centered basis sets. Many computational techniques presented here are inspired by the extensive method developments rooted in quantum chemistry. In this Focus Article, we selectively focus on the computational techniques rooted in molecular quantum chemistry, emphasize some challenges, and point out open questions. We hope our perspectives will encourage researchers to pursue this exciting and promising research avenue.</description>

      <title>Influence of concentration-dependent material properties on the fracture and debonding of electrode particles with core-shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particle designs offer a route to improved lithium-ion battery performance. However, they are susceptible to mechanical damage such as fracture and debonding, which can significantly reduce their lifetime. Using a coupled finite element model, we explore the impacts of diffusion-induced stresses on the failure mechanisms of an exemplar system with an NMC811 core and an NMC111 shell. In particular, we systematically compare the implications of assuming constant material properties against using Li concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient and partial molar volume. With constant material properties, our results show that smaller cores with thinner shells avoid debonding and fracture regimes. When factoring in a concentration-dependent partial molar volume, the maximum values of tensile hoop stress in the shell are found to be significantly lower than those predicted with constant properties, reducing the likelihood of fracture. Furthermore, with a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, significant barriers to full electrode utilisation are observed due to reduced lithium mobility at high states of lithiation. This provides a possible explanation for the reduced accessible capacity observed in experiments. Shell thickness is found to be the dominant factor in precluding structural integrity once the concentration dependency is accounted for. These findings shed new light on the performance and effective design of core-shell electrode particles.</description>

      <title>How quickly can sodium-ion learn? Assessing scenarios for techno-economic competitiveness against lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which have experienced challenges in supply availability and volatility in pricing of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected Na-ion and Li-ion price trends across over 5,400 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. We show that Na-ion struggles to be price advantageous against low-cost lithium-ion variants in the near term and are competitive primarily when the Li-ion supply chain is disrupted. Modeled outcomes suggest maximizing Na-ion energy densities via cost-centric development roadmaps to be the most impactful way to improve competitiveness (over that of market intervention) and highlights the value of enhanced supply chain security.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Reuse Transfer Learning Methods in Molecular and Material Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules and materials are the foundation for the development of modern advanced industries such as energy storage systems and semiconductor devices. However, traditional trial-and-error methods or theoretical calculations are highly resource-intensive, and extremely long R&amp;D (Research and Development) periods cannot meet the urgent need for molecules/materials in industrial development. Machine learning (ML) methods based on big data are expected to break this dilemma. However, the difficulty in constructing large-scale datasets of new molecules/materials due to the high cost of data acquisition and annotation limits the development of machine learning. The application of transfer learning lowers the data requirements for model training, which makes transfer learning stand out in researches addressing data quality issues. In this review, we summarize recent advances in transfer learning related to molecular and materials science. We focus on the application of transfer learning methods for the discovery of advanced molecules/materials, particularly, the construction of transfer learning frameworks for different systems, and how transfer learning can enhance the performance of models. In addition, the challenges of transfer learning are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Leap: molecular synthesisability scoring with intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing whether a molecule can be synthesised is a primary task in drug discovery. It enables computational chemists to filter for viable compounds or bias molecular generative models. The notion of synthesisability is dynamic as it evolves depending on the availability of key compounds. A common approach in drug discovery involves exploring the chemical space surrounding synthetically-accessible intermediates. This strategy improves the synthesisability of the derived molecules due to the availability of key intermediates. Existing synthesisability scoring methods such as SAScore, SCScore and RAScore, cannot condition on intermediates dynamically. Our approach, Leap, is a GPT-2 model trained on the depth, or longest linear path, of predicted synthesis routes that allows information on the availability of key intermediates to be included at inference time. We show that Leap surpasses all other scoring methods by at least 5% on AUC score when identifying synthesisable molecules, and can successfully adapt predicted scores when presented with a relevant intermediate compound.</description>

      <title>Operando Characterization and Molecular Simulations Reveal the Growth Kinetics of Graphene on Liquid Copper during Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18331v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, liquid metal catalysts have emerged as a compelling choice for the controllable, large-scale, and high-quality synthesis of two-dimensional materials. At present, there is little mechanistic understanding of the intricate catalytic process, though, of its governing factors or what renders it superior to growth at the corresponding solid catalysts. Here, we report on a combined experimental and computational study of the kinetics of graphene growth during chemical vapor deposition on a liquid copper catalyst. By monitoring the growing graphene flakes in real time using in situ radiation-mode optical microscopy, we explore the growth morphology and kinetics over a wide range of CH4-to-H2 pressure ratios and deposition temperatures. Constant growth rates of the flakes' radius indicate a growth mode limited by precursor attachment, whereas methane-flux-dependent flake shapes point to limited precursor availability. Large-scale free energy simulations enabled by an efficient machine-learning moment tensor potential trained to density-functional theory data provide quantitative barriers for key atomic-scale growth processes. The wealth of experimental and theoretical data can be consistently combined into a microkinetic model that reveals mixed growth kinetics that, in contrast to the situation at solid Cu, is partly controlled by precursor attachment alongside precursor availability. Key mechanistic aspects that directly point toward the improved graphene quality are a largely suppressed carbon dimer attachment due to the facile incorporation of this precursor species into the liquid surface and a low-barrier ring-opening process that self-heals 5-membered rings resulting from remaining dimer attachments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Twist-Averaging Technique for Magnetic Metals: Applications using Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an improved twist-averaging scheme for quantum Monte Carlo methods that use converged Kohn-Sham or Hartree-Fock orbitals as the reference. This twist-averaging technique is tailored to sample the Brillouin zone of magnetic metals, although it naturally extends to nonmagnetic conducting systems. The proposed scheme aims to reproduce the reference magnetization and achieves charge neutrality by construction, thus avoiding the large energy fluctuations and the postprocessing needed to correct the energies. It shows the most robust convergence of total energy and magnetism to the thermodynamic limit when compared to four other twist-averaging schemes. Diffusion Monte Carlo applications are shown on nonmagnetic Al and ferromagnetic $\alpha$-Fe. The cohesive energy of Al in the thermodynamic limit shows an excellent agreement with the experimental result. Furthermore, the magnetic moments in $\alpha$-Fe exhibit rapid convergence with an increasing number of twists.</description>
