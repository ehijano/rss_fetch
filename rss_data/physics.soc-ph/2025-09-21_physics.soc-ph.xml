      <title>A Timeless Game: A Game-Theoretic Model of Mass-Geometry Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal, timeless game-theoretic representation of the mass-geometry relation. An "Object" (mass) and "Space" (geometry) choose strategies in a static normal-form game; utilities encode stability as mutual consistency rather than dynamical payoffs. In a 2x2 toy model, the equilibria correspond to "light-flat" and "heavy-curved" configurations; a continuous variant clarifies when only trivial interior equilibria appear versus a continuum along a matching ray. Philosophically, the point is representational: a global description may be static while the experience of temporal flow for embedded observers arises from informational asymmetry, coarse-graining, and records. The framework separates time as parameter from relational constraint without committing to specific physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Community-level Contagion among Diverse Financial Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global financial markets become increasingly interconnected, financial contagion has developed into a major influencer of asset price dynamics. Motivated by this context, our study explores financial contagion both within and between asset communities. We contribute to the literature by examining the contagion phenomenon at the community level rather than among individual assets. Our experiments rely on high-frequency data comprising cryptocurrencies, stocks and US ETFs over the 4-year period from April 2019 to May 2023. Using the Louvain community detection algorithm, Vector Autoregression contagion detection model and Tracy-Widom random matrix theory for noise removal from financial assets, we present three main findings. Firstly, while the magnitude of contagion remains relatively stable over time, contagion density (the percentage of asset pairs exhibiting contagion within a financial system) increases. This suggests that market uncertainty is better characterized by the transmission of shocks more broadly than by the strength of any single spillover. Secondly, there is no significant difference between intra- and inter-community contagion, indicating that contagion is a system-wide phenomenon rather than being confined to specific asset groups. Lastly, certain communities themselves, especially those dominated by Information Technology assets, consistently appear to act as major contagion transmitters in the financial network over the examined period, spreading shocks with high densities to many other communities. Our findings suggest that traditional risk management strategies such as portfolio diversification through investing in low-correlated assets or different types of investment vehicle might be insufficient due to widespread contagion.</description>

      <title>Post crisis Strategies: Antifragility Principles as Catalysts for Urban Evolution Towards Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban crises reveal the true essence of cities: their ability to either withstand disorder or collapse under its pressure. This article explores how antifragility principles can transforms urban disruption into levers for reinforcement and innovation. While resilience seeks to restore a lost balance, antifragility goes further: it pushes cities to improve through shocks. Across a critical analysis of post-crisis strategies and the identification of fifteen fundamental theoretical principles, this work proposes a new framework, structuring a proactive and evolutionary approach to urban development. Medell\'in, Singapore and Fukushima already illustrate this dynamic, showing that adversity can catalyse profound transformations. By integrating institutional flexibility, strategic diversity and self-organization, antifragility poses itself as an alternative to the limits of resilience. Can this model really redefine the way cities adapt to crises? This article paves the way for a decisive reflection to rethink urban planning in an uncertain world.</description>

      <title>A Social Force Model for Companion Groups Considering Relative-Weight Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an improved social force model for companion group that incorporates relative weight attraction. Based on the traditional social force model, the interaction forces among individuals within leader-follower groups are described by introducing relative weight attraction. Additionally, a velocity synchronization term is integrated into the pedestrians' self-driving force to address the problem of group dispersion commonly found in traditional models. Furthermore, the desired direction of followers within the companion group is refined to adapt to the evacuation movement led by the group leader. These enhancements collectively form a Social Force Model of companion groups considering relative weight attraction. Through comparative analysis of pedestrian evacuation processes in bidirectional channel simulation experiments between the relative weight attraction model and the traditional molecular potential (force) model, this study finds that the relative weight attraction model demonstrates stronger regulation and following capabilities when simulating collisions between companion groups and pedestrians or obstacles, more effectively ensuring group cohesion. Building upon this foundation, this study further investigates the impact of varying companion ratios on evacuation efficiency within the relative-weight attraction model. The results demonstrate that evacuation time steps exhibit a non-monotonic trend (initial increase, followed by a decrease, and a subsequent rise) as the companion ratio escalates. Additionally, across multiple simulation runs, the standard deviation of evacuation time steps expands with increasing companion ratios, indicating heightened fluctuation in individual evacuation timing.</description>

      <title>Oil Peak and the Decline of Net Energy: Policy Implications from an EROI-Entropy Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Net energy - the energy obtained from a resource after accounting for the energy expended in its acquisition - fundamentally determines the capacity of societies to sustain and expand. The extended Energy Return on Investment (EROIext) incorporates not only extraction and refining but also transport and end-use infrastructure, yet its long-term dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we apply a Single-Cycle Lotka-Volterra (SCLV) model to the global petroleum system, calibrated with historical data from 1965-2012. The model projects trajectories of production, capital, and EROIext to 2100, and integrates an entropy-based indicator to evaluate the system's ability to maintain social order. Results show that oil production peaks around 2041, while EROIext declines continuously and falls below unity by 2081. This marks the point at which oil no longer delivers net energy, coinciding with the peak of capital stock, suggesting unsustainable investment in a diminishing resource. The rising entropy ratio signals declining systemic resilience. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating energy systems not only by quantity or cost but also by thermodynamic quality, with direct implications for balancing short-term energy security and long-term sustainability in policy design.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Learning and Optimization methods for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a fundamental NP-hard problem in logistics. Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM) for solving CVRP performance depends heavily on well-tuned penalty parameters. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization approach that integrates deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the selection of penalty parameter values within both classical (RL-C-ALM) and quantum-enhanced (RL-Q-ALM) ALM solvers. Using Soft Actor-Critic, our approach learns penalty values from CVRP instance features and constraint violations. In RL-Q-ALM, subproblems are encoded as QUBOs and solved using Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE). The agent learns across episodes by maximizing solution feasibility and minimizing cost. Experiments show that RL-C-ALM outperforms manually tuned ALM on synthetic and benchmark CVRP instances, achieving better solutions with fewer iterations. Also, RL-Q-ALM matches classical solution quality on small instances but incurs higher runtimes due to quantum overhead. Our results highlight the potential of combining RL with classical and quantum solvers for scalable, adaptive combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-technology convergence patterns with hypergraphs: Evolution and prediction using patent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technology convergence integrates distinct domains to create novel combinations, driving radical innovation that reshapes markets and industries. However, most approaches rely on pairwise networks that cannot capture multi-technology interactions and suffer scale biases from heterogeneous patenting activity. To overcome these gaps, we propose a hypergraph-based framework that directly models multi-technology convergence and identifies statistically significant convergence via a probabilistic null model. Using four decades of USPTO patent data (1984-2023), we construct two hypergraphs: a co-classification-based hypergraph representing explicit inventive convergence and a co-citation-based hypergraph capturing implicit knowledge-flow convergence. Evolution analysis on both hypergraph types reveals a sustained growth in multi-technology and cross-domain convergence, with a marked shift from chemistry-led to computing-led convergence patterns. Building on these insights, we formulate the forecasting of technology convergence as a hyperedge prediction task. We implement random forest classifiers trained on two complementary feature sets derived from both hypergraphs: similarity features capturing structural and semantic similarities among technologies, and intrinsic features representing inherent attributes of technologies. Predictive results demonstrate that co-citation-based features exhibit stronger predictive power than co-classification-based ones, with their combination achieving optimal performance. Explainable AI analyses identify global knowledge-flow reachability and semantic similarity as dominant drivers of convergence, while intrinsic citation and economic values exhibit contrasting associations with convergence probability. This framework bridges evolution analysis and predictive modeling of multi-technology convergence, offering actionable insights for innovation strategy.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Population Loss in Mexican Urban Centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its pervasive implications, many cities around the world continue to expand in a fragmented and horizontal manner. Here, we analyse the complex dynamics of urban growth across 69 metropolitan areas in Mexico, using census data from 1990 to 2020, and develop a model of urban form change that considers changes in population size, density, and spatial configuration. We employ a radial probability density function and the urban expansion factor to create a framework for comparing urban expansion over time and across different regions. Over the past three decades, Mexico's urban population has nearly doubled; however, populations have shifted outward, resulting in a decline of 2.5 million residents in central areas. Our analysis shows that distances from the city centre have increased by 28% on average, driven by population losses in central zones combined with growth in peripheral regions.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>
