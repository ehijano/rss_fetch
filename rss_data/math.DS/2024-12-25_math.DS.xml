      <title>Predator Prey Scavenger Model using Holling's Functional Response of Type III and Physics-Informed Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear mathematical models introduce the relation between various physical and biological interactions present in nature. One of the most famous models is the Lotka-Volterra model which defined the interaction between predator and prey species present in nature. However, predators, scavengers, and prey populations coexist in a natural system where scavengers can additionally rely on the dead bodies of predators present in the system. Keeping this in mind, the formulation and simulation of the predator prey scavenger model is introduced in this paper. For the predation response, respective prey species are assumed to have Holling's functional response of type III. The proposed model is tested for various simulations and is found to be showing satisfactory results in different scenarios. After simulations, the American forest dataset is taken for parameter estimation which imitates the real-world case. For parameter estimation, a physics-informed deep neural network is used with the Adam backpropagation method which prevents the avalanche effect in trainable parameters updation. For neural networks, mean square error and physics-informed informed error are considered. After the neural network, the hence-found parameters are fine-tuned using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Finally, the hence-found parameters using a natural dataset are tested for stability using Jacobian stability analysis. Future research work includes minimization of error induced by parameters, bifurcation analysis, and sensitivity analysis of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Modulating function-based fast convergent observer for the Coupled Tanks system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we apply the observer approach introduced by Djennoune et al. \cite{djennoune2019modulating} to estimate water levels in a coupled tanks system. Central to this approach is the use of a remarkable modulating function-based transformation $T_n $, which employs a time/output-dependent coordinate transformation. This transformation converts the original system into a form where the effects of initial conditions are effectively nullified. The primary advantage of utilizing the $T_n $ transformation is its ability to achieve instantaneous convergence, ensuring both rapid and accurate state estimation. The observer's finite-time convergence is assured, with the estimation error remaining bounded within a finite period. Numerical simulations further validate the effectiveness of this method for the Coupled Tanks system, demonstrating the robustness of the $T_n $ transformation in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In late 1990's Tsujii proved monotonicity of topological entropy of real quadratic family $f_c(x)=x^2+c$ on parameter $c$ by proving an inequality concerning orbital information of the critical point. In this paper, we consider a weak analog of such inequality for the general family $f_{c,r}(x)=|x|^r+c$ with rational $r&gt;1$, by following an algebraic approach.</description>

      <title>Infinite graph product of groups II: Analytic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytic properties of graph product of finite groups with a hyperbolic defining graph. This is done by studying dynamics on the Bowditch compactification of the extension graph, or the crossing graph, of graph product. In particular, we provide a new class of convergence groups and identify the if and only if condition for this convergence action to be geometrically finite. We also provide a new class of properly proximal groups, relatively bi-exact groups, and groups with strongly solid group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A universal reproducing kernel Hilbert space for learning nonlinear systems operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning nonlinear operators that correspond to discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with inputs. Given an initial state and a finite input trajectory, such operators yield a finite output trajectory compatible with the system dynamics. Inspired by the universal approximation theorem of operators tailored to radial basis functions neural networks, we construct a class of kernel functions as the product of kernel functions in the space of input trajectories and initial states, respectively. We prove that for positive definite kernel functions, the resulting product reproducing kernel Hilbert space is dense and even complete in the space of nonlinear systems operators, under suitable assumptions. This provides a universal kernel-functions-based framework for learning nonlinear systems operators, which is intuitive and easy to apply to general nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Qusimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretiza-tion method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to that of DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared toDOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Upper semi-continuity of metric entropy for diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $C^{r}$ $(r&gt;1)$ diffeomorphism on a compact manifold that admits a dominated splitting, this paper establishes the upper semi-continuity of the entropy map. More precisely, this paper establishes the upper semi-continuity of the entropy map in the following two cases:
  (1) if a sequence of invariant measures has only positive Lyapunov exponents along a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov exponents along another sub-bundle, then the upper limit of their metric entropies is less than or equal to the entropy of the limiting measure; (2) if an invariant measure has positive Lyapunov exponents along a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov exponents along another sub-bundle, then the entropy map is upper semi-continuous at this measure.</description>

      <title>Zero-full law for well approximable sets in missing digit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b \geq 3$ be an integer and $C(b,D)$ be the set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ whose base $b$ expansion only consists of digits in a set $D \subseteq \{0,...,b-1\}$. We study how close can numbers in $C(b,D)$ be approximated by rational numbers with denominators being powers of some integer $t$ and obtain a zero-full law for its Hausdorff measure in several circumstances. When $b$ and $t$ are multiplicatively dependent, our results correct an error of Levesley, Salp and Velani (Math. Ann., 338:97-118, 2007) and generalize their theorem. When $b$ and $t$ are multiplicatively independent but have the same prime divisors, we obtain a partial result on the Hausdorff measure and bounds for the Hausdorff dimension, which are close to the multiplicatively dependent case. Based on these results, several conjectures are proposed.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Flow Map Learning of PDEs from Incomplete, Limited, and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational technique for modeling the evolution of dynamical systems in a reduced basis, with a focus on the challenging problem of modeling partially-observed partial differential equations (PDEs) on high-dimensional non-uniform grids. We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This allows for rapid high-resolution simulations, enabled by smaller training data sets and reduced training times.</description>
