      <title>Topology of restricted phase space thermodynamics in Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the Kerr-Sen-Ads black hole in restricted phase space. In the restricted phase space, a new parameter, central charge $C$, and its conjugate parameter $\mu$ are introduced, omitting the well-known $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We study the local and global topology of the black hole by considering the black hole solution as topological defects in the free energy landscape. We compute the winding number and the total topological number at the thermodynamic defects. For our analysis, we have considered five ensembles of Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in restricted phase space: fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$, fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$, and fixed $(\phi,\Omega, C)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge, $J$ is the angular momentum, $C$ is the central charge, $\phi$ is the electric potential conjugate to charge, $\Omega$ is the angular frequency conjugate to $J$, and finally, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, and fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$ ensembles, we find a topological charge of $+1$. In the fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$ and fixed $(\phi, \Omega, C)$ ensembles, depending on the values of the thermodynamic parameters, we find topological charges of $-1$, $0$, and $+1$. Interestingly, in ensembles where we find the topological charge to be $0$, we observe both Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions. We show that both types of these phase transitions can be studied using a common vector field, and the topological charges associated with Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Refining holographic models of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quark-gluon plasma at nonzero density by using two holographic models for QCD based on either brane or Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton actions. We determine the parameters of these models through a systematic statistical fitting procedure to lattice QCD data, which encompasses the equation of state (through the entropy density) and the two lowest baryon number susceptibilities. The predictions from the two models for the higher-order susceptibilities and the equation of state at nonzero density are strikingly similar. In particular, both models suggest the presence of a critical point on the $(\mu_B,T)$-phase diagram near $\mu_B/T \approx 6$. The results for the equation of state are in agreement with lattice data for higher-order susceptibilities and experimental data for the cumulants of the net-proton number from the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Modulated instabilities and the AdS$_2$ point in dense holographic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of hot and dense QCD plasma by using the gauge/gravity duality. To this end, we carry out a comprehensive classification and analysis of quasinormal modes of charged black holes in the holographic V-QCD model. It turns out that the Chern-Simons term determined by the flavor anomalies of QCD is strong enough to drive a modulated instability. While such an instability is expected at high densities, we find that the unstable phase extends to surprisingly low densities and high temperatures, close to the region where data from lattice simulations is available. We also analyze the limit of small temperature which is controlled by a quantum critical AdS$_2$ point. We study in detail the signatures of the critical point in the quasinormal mode spectrum, focusing on the interplay between the hydrodynamic modes and other modes.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Fronsdal currents in the $AdS_{4}$ higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse higher-spin theory with general coupling constant $\eta$ at the second order, focusing on the gauge non-invariant vertices $\Upsilon(\omega,\omega)$, $\Upsilon(\Omega,\omega,C)$ and $\Upsilon(\omega,C)$, that are shown to generate nontrivial currents in the Fronsdal equations. Explicit expressions for the currents are found in the frame-like formalism counterpart of the TT gauge worked out in the paper. The nonlinear higher-spin theory is shown to generate all types of Metsaev's currents with the coupling constants manifestly expressed via the complex coupling constant $\eta$ of the higher-spin theory. It is shown that all currents in the higher-spin theory are conformal in the TT gauge except for those bilinear in the higher-spin gauge fields $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Generating functional of correlators of twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is the second installment, where we compute the generating functional of correlators of collinear twist-$2$ operators that enter the components of unbalanced superfields -- i.e., superfields with an unequal number of dotted and undotted indices in their spinor representation -- in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY SU($N$) YM theory in Minkowskian and Euclidean space-time, in the conformal limit and renormalization-group improved form, and to the leading and next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. The corresponding generating functional of correlators of balanced superfields has been worked out in the first installment. Hence, our large-$N$ calculation sets strong ultraviolet asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY YM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

      <title>On the $N_c$-insensitivity of QCD$_{2A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of two-dimensional adjoint QCD is surprisingly insensitive to the number of colors $N_c$ of its gauge group. It is argued that the cancellation of finite $N_c$ terms is rather natural and a consequence of the singularity structure of the theory. In short, there are no finite $N_c$ contraction terms, hence there cannot be any finite $N_c$ singular terms, since the former are necessary to guarantee well-behaved principal value integrals. We evaluate and categorize the matrix elements of the theory's light-cone Hamiltonian to show how terms emerging from finite $N_c$ contributions to the anti-commutator cancel against contributions from the purely finite $N_c$ term of the Hamiltonian. The cancellation is not complete; finite terms survive and modify the spectrum, as is known from numerical work.</description>

      <title>The open string pair production revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null detection of the QED Schwinger pair production so far could imply a possibility regarding if the usual QED vacuum picture is a complete one. In this paper, we address this possibility by taking our own (1 + 3)-dimensional world as a D3 brane in Type IIB superstring theory and by considering an analogous open string pair production process. There is a sharp distinction between this stringy pair production and the Schwinger pair production from the braneworld view and as such the future positive or negative detection of either can falsify if our own world can be indeed taken as a D3 brane. The implications of this are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy and horizon temperature in conformal quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generators of radial conformal symmetries in Minkowski space-time can be put in correspondence with generators of time evolution in conformal quantum mechanics. Within this correspondence we show that in conformal quantum mechanics the state corresponding to the inertial vacuum for a conformally invariant field in Minkowski space-time has the structure of a thermofield double. The latter is built from a bipartite "vacuum state" corresponding to the ground state of the generators of hyperbolic time evolution. These can evolve states only within a portion of the time domain. When such generators correspond to conformal Killing vectors mapping a causal diamond in itself and generators of dilations, the temperature of the thermofield double reproduces, respectively, the diamond temperature and the Milne temperature found for massless fields in Minkowski space-time. Moreover, we compute the entanglement entropy associated to the thermofield double states obtaining a UV divergent logarithmic behaviour akin to known results in two-dimensional conformal field theory where the entangling boundary is point-like.</description>

      <title>U-duality in quantum M2-branes and gauged supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relation of the M2-brane with fluxes and monodromy in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, which has a quantum discrete supersymmetric spectrum with finite multiplicity, and type IIB gauged supergravities in nine dimensions. $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of isotopy classes of the area preserving diffeomorphisms. The global description of these M2-branes we are considering is formulated on twisted torus bundles, and they are classified in terms of $H^2(\Sigma,\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{\rho}})$, or equivalently, by their coinvariants for a given monodromy subgroup. We find the 'gauge' symmetries between equivalent M2-branes, on torus bundles with monodromy, that leads to $\mathbb{R}$, $SO(2)$ or $SO(1,1)$, the symmetry groups of type IIB gauged supergravities in 9d. We obtain an explicit relation between the equivalent classes of M2-brane bundles and the mass parameters that classify the gaugings of type IIB supergravities in 9d. We also find that the symmetries, between inequivalent M2-branes on twisted torus bundles for a given monodromy, are related with $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathcal{Z}_3$, $\mathcal{Z}_5$, $\mathcal{Z}_9$ or $\mathcal{Z}_{2n-7}$ for $n\geq 5$, the U-duality symmetry group, a subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In distinction, in the case without monodromy, related to type II maximal supergravity at low energies, its U-duality group corresponds to the full $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

Abstract: A certain two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory is argued to satisfy a relation that promotes the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation to an infrared duality between two quantum field theories. Solutions of the tetrahedron equation with continuous spin variables are obtained from partition functions of this theory and its variants.</description>

      <title>KdV conformal symmetry breaking in nearly AdS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gauge theory formulation of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and propose Korteweg-de Vries asymptotic conditions that generalize the asymptotic dynamics of the theory. They permit to construct an enlarged set of boundary actions formed by higher order generalizations of the Schwarzian derivative that contain the Schwarzian as lower term in a tower of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariants. They are extracted from the KdV Hamiltonians and can be obtained recursively. As a result, the conformal symmetry breaking observed in nearly AdS$_{2}$ is characterized by a much larger set of dynamical modes associated to the stationary KdV hierarchy. We study quantum perturbation theory for the generalized Schwarzian action including the symplectic measure and compute the one-loop correction to the partition function. We find that that despite the non-linear nature of the higher-Schwarzian contribution, it acquires a manageable expression that renders a curious leading temperature dependence on the entropy $S=\#T^{a}$ for $a$ an odd integer.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constraints on Page Curves: Insights from Island Rule and Quantum Focusing Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the inverse problem tied to the Page curve phenomenon and island paradigm, we investigate the geometric conditions underpinning black hole evaporation where information is preserved and islands manifest, giving rise to the characteristic Page curve. Focusing on a broad class of static black hole metrics in asymptotically Minkowski or (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, we derive a pivotal constraint on the blacken factor $f(r)$ for which the island exists and reproduce the Page curve. Specifically, we reveal that a sufficient yet not universally necessary criterion -- manifested in the negativity of the second derivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $f^{\prime \prime} (r)&lt;0$, in proximity to the event horizon where $r \sim r_h+ {\cal O} (G_N)$, ensures the emergence of Page curves in a manner transcending specific theoretical models. This pivotal finding, supported by the tenets of the quantum focusing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to 3d BPS Indices and Topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a 3d gauged linear sigma model parametrized by a Kahler manifold X, the 3d BPS index defines a q-series that can be analytically continued in the Kahler modulus by standard methods. It is argued that an SL(2,Z)-transform of the Birkhoff connection matrix captures non-perturbative corrections to the 3d GLSM. As an application, a 3d lift of the standard 2d GLSM for the resolved conifold is shown to provide a world-volume dual for the non-perturbative topological string on the resolved conifold. The perturbative 3d BPS index computes the Gopakumar-Vafa partition function, while the analytic continuation matches existing proposals for a non-perturbative completion of the topological string.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the spatially inhomogeneous condensates in the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model via the bosonic two-point function in the infinite-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is refered to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <title>Geometric formulation of generalized root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generic geometric formalism that incorporates both $T\bar{T}$-like and root-$T\bar{T}$-like deformations in arbitrary dimensions. This framework applies to a wide family of stress-energy tensor perturbations and encompasses various well-known field theories. Building upon the recently proposed correspondence between Ricci-based gravity and $T\bar{T}$-like deformations, we further extend this duality to include root-$T\bar{T}$-like perturbations. This refinement extends the potential applications of our approach and contributes to a deeper exploration of the interplay between stress tensor perturbations and gravitational dynamics. Among the various original outcomes detailed in this article, we have also obtained a deformation of the flat Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the five-dimensional non-Abelian $\mathcal{N}=1$ Chern-Simons action from its established definition of variation with respect to an infinitesimal deformation of the vector prepotential in a projective superspace setting. It has been a long-standing open problem how to integrate this variation. Now, thanks to the simplicity of a projective superspace technique, we have been finally able to obtain this term. As a bonus, we also give the supersymmetric Yang-Mills action with a half measure as well.</description>

Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

Specifically, we explore the consequences of $T\bar{T}$, $J\bar{{T}}$, and $J\bar{{J}}$ deformations, focusing on first-order corrections in the deformation parameter. Under $T\bar{{T}}$ deformation, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$ exhibit unexpected behavior, deviating from linear growth within the valid perturbative regime. Notably, the Krylov exponent characterizing the rate of exponential growth of complexity surpasses that of the undeformed theory, suggesting a potential violation of the conjectured operator growth bound within the realm of perturbative analysis. In contrast to this, both $J\bar{{J}}$ and $J\bar{{T}}$ deformations induce no first order correction to either the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients at large-$n$ or the Krylov exponent and hence the results for these two deformations align with those of the undeformed theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study worldsheet sphere amplitudes, in the RNS formalism, in superstring theory on $\text{AdS}_3\times X$ with pure NS-NS flux using the near-boundary approximation. By computing a number of amplitudes at low-lying spectral flow, we deduce a candidate for a dual CFT for generic $X$. Specialising to $X={\rm S^3}\times \mathbb{T}^4$ and with minimal NS-NS flux, i.e., to the tensionless limit, we explore the effect of the interaction term which we ignore in the near-boundary consideration. We show that amplitudes in the tensionless superstring theory on $\rm AdS_3\times S^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ do not receive perturbative contributions from such an interaction term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite-distance limits in the moduli space of perturbative string vacua. The remarkable interplay of string dualities seems to determine a highly non-trivial dichotomy, summarized by the emergent string conjecture, by which in some duality frame either internal dimensions decompactify or a unique critical string becomes tensionless. Assuming the existence of light states, we investigate whether this pattern persists in potentially non-geometric settings, showing that (a proxy for) the cutoff of the gravitational effective field theory in perturbative type II vacua scales with the spectral gap of the internal conformal field theory in the same manner as in decompactification or emergent string limits, regardless of supersymmetry or whether the internal sector is geometric. As a byproduct, we elucidate the role of the species scale in (de)compactifications and show compatibility between effective field theory and worldsheet approaches in the presence of curvature deformations in geometric settings.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present evidence for a spatially modulated instability within the deconfined quark-gluon plasma phase of QCD. This evidence is based on robust predictions from generic holographic models, accurately fitted to lattice data, where the instability is driven by the Chern-Simons term mandated by the flavor anomalies of QCD. Such an instability occurs universally across holographic models at surprisingly low densities, within the crossover region amenable to lattice and experimental studies, therefore inviting further explorations of inhomogeneous phases in this region.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Strong Symmetry Breaking in Open Systems: Purification Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the landscape of the decoherence effect in mixed-state ensembles from a purification perspective. We analyze the spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) in mixed states triggered by local quantum channels by mapping this decoherence process to unitary operations in the purified state within an extended Hilbert space. Our key finding is that mixed-state long-range order and SSSB can be mapped into symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in the purified state. Notably, the measurement-induced long-range order in the purified SPT state mirrors the long-range order in the mixed state due to SSSB, characterized by the Renyi-2 correlator. We establish a correspondence between fidelity correlators in the mixed state, which serve as a measure of SSSB, and strange correlators in the purification, which signify the SPT order. This purification perspective is further extended to explore intrinsic mixed-state topological order and decoherent symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Higgs criticality in and beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of the Higgs potential are determined by three parameters: the mass parameter, the quartic self-coupling, and a constant term. Remarkably, all three of these parameters seem subject to a significant amount of fine-tuning. All these tunings can be seen as their corresponding parameters being close to critical values marking quantum phase transitions. While such behavior is surprising from a conventional particle physics perspective, it is a common feature of dynamical systems. This has motivated the conjecture that the values of the Higgs' parameters are the result of some dynamical mechanism. This possibility suggests the construction of mechanisms dynamically choosing sets of Higgs parameters. In these notes, I discuss a complementary approach. Taking seriously that such a mechanism could exist in nature, it is plausible to assume that it also influences Beyond-Standard-Model physics. This suggests considering near-criticality in any model of interest and investigating its consequences more generally, in particular independent of a concrete mechanism responsible for it. I first explain what it means for the parameters of the Higgs potential to be near-critical. This includes a discussion of the recently discovered "metastability bound" on the Higgs mass, which can be understood through a critical point. I then review two concrete examples of mechanisms in which the parameters of the Higgs potential are dynamically driven towards critical values. These mechanisms also serve as an important proof on concept for the feasibility of the assumptions at the foundation of these notes. Using a simple example for concreteness, the final part of these notes then explicitly demonstrates how to approach a given model in the light of the near-criticality conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the time-dependent characteristics of AB-type effects holds significant importance in contemporary physics and its practical applications. Here, we delve into the investigation of time-dependent topological effects emerging in AB-type experimental setups. We first analyze the topological effects on magnetic dipoles moving in closed trajectories around the time-varying magnetic field source solenoid, then on electrical dipoles around a time-varying electric field source in 2+1 dimensions without any approximation. Last, we discuss the characteristics of the topological effects by considering the identity and dualities between phases from an integrated perspective.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the quasinormal modes of a $5$-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity have been investigated with the help of the Pad\'e averaged higher order WKB approximation method and the validity of Hod's conjecture has been studied. It is found that the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking due to the Bumblebee field favours Hod's conjecture. But in the case of the Gauss-Bonnet term, an increase in the coupling parameter increases the chances of violation of Hod's conjecture. We further investigated the optical properties of the black hole {\it viz.}, shadow and emission rate. It is found that a black hole with a lower lifetime favours Hod's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a topological quantum field theory phase for four-dimensional gravity. We show it is able to generate, not only General Relativity, but the whole family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity. This is accomplished due to the existence of a topological symmetry that, when explicitly broken, via the introduction of a mass scale, releases the local degrees of freedom of gravity. Additionally, we introduce an extended notion of the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge conditions to evaluate the Ward identities, counterterms, and prove the quantum stability of the model, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the algebraic renormalization technique.</description>

      <title>Gauging staggered fermion shift symmetries and lattice anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Staggered fermion shift symmetries correspond to translations within the unit cell of a hypercubic lattice. They satisfy an algebra and in four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of $SU(4)$ which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered fermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global parameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation symmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To maintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher form gauge fields. We show how there is a geometrical obstruction to this procedure in the case of full staggered fermions which is consistent with the existence of a 't Hooft anomaly in the continuum $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry. However no such obstruction is encountered for reduced staggered fermions for which the continuum non-anomalous flavor symmetry is $SO(4)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have applied thermodynamic stability analysis to derive the stability and causality conditions for conventional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and spin hydrodynamics. We obtain the thermodynamic stability conditions for second-order relativistic hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscous tensors, finding them identical to those derived from linear mode analysis. We then derive the thermodynamic stability conditions for minimal causal extended second-order spin hydrodynamics in canonical form, both with and without viscous tensors. Without viscous tensors, the constraints from thermodynamic stability exactly match those from linear mode analysis. In the presence of viscous tensors, the thermodynamic stability imposes more stringent constraints than those obtained from linear mode analysis. Our results suggest that conditions derived from thermodynamic stability analysis can guarantee both causality and stability in linear mode analysis.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart $\&amp;$ Gong and developed by Auclair $\&amp;$ Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum, including its amplitude, spectral indices, their running and running of their running, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectrum of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation, without a field redefinition. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_*$. Surprisingly we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_* = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and low-dimensionalization in four dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of low-dimensionalization in 4D QCD. We propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate low-dimensionalization in the DR gauge in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider ``$tz$-projection'' of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, 4D QCD is reduced into an ensemble of 2D QCD systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K.~Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Robustness of inflation to kinetic inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large inhomogeneities in both the inflaton field and its momentum. We find that in general, large kinetic perturbations reduce the number of e-folds of inflation. In particular, we observe that inflationary models with sub-Planckian characteristic scales are not robust even to kinetic energy densities that are sub-dominant to the potential energy density. This strengthens the results of our previous work. In inflationary models with super-Planckian characteristic scales, despite a reduction in the number of e-folds, inflation is robust even when the potential energy density is initially sub-dominant. For the cases we study, the robustness of inflation strongly depends on whether the inflaton field is driven into the reheating phase by the inhomogeneous scalar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and their relationship to polymerized models and mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present further applications of the formalism introduced by the authors in arXiv:2308.10949, which allows embedding of a broad class of generalized LTB models into effective spherically symmetric spacetimes. We focus on regular black hole models, where a broad class of models can be considered, including for example LQG-inspired models as well as the model with a regular center, e.g. of Bardeen and Hayward. For a certain class of regular black hole models, we can formulate a Birkhoff-like theorem in LTB coordinates. We further show that depending on the properties of the polymerization functions characterizing such regular black hole models in this formalism, the uniqueness of the effective spherically symmetric vacuum solutions might not be given in general in Schwarzschild-like coordinates. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction algorithm that allows for a subclass of this models to construct from a given metric in Schwarzschild-like coordinates the corresponding effective spherically symmetric model, its dynamics as an 1+1-dimensional field theory as well as a corresponding covariant Lagrangian of extended mimetic gravity in four dimensions. Such a reconstruction allows us to obtain Lagrangians of extended mimetic gravity models for black holes with a regular center, e.g. the Bardeen and Hayward metric as well as for effective LQG inspired models. Moreover, the reconstruction enables us to extend regular black hole models to general inhomogeneous dust collapse models. For the latter, within this formalism, we can investigate and look at the physical properties of the models such as the existence of weak shell-crossing singularities from a novel perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the reaction $\psi(3686) \to \bar{\Xi}^+ \bar{K}^0 \Sigma^{*-}$, with the $\Sigma^{*-}$ decaying to $\pi^- \Lambda$ in order to show evidence for the existence of two $\Xi(1820)$ states, one around $1824$ MeV and narrow, and another one around $1875$ MeV and wide. The phase space for $\bar{K}^0 \Sigma^{*-}$ production reduces the effect of the lower mass resonance, magnifying the effect of the higher mass resonance that shows clearly over the phase space. The estimated rate of the production is bigger than the one of the $\psi(3686) \to \bar{\Xi}^+ K^- \Lambda$ reaction, where a clear peak for $\Xi(1820)$ was observed by the BESIII collaboration, what makes the Beijing facility ideal to carry out the reaction proposed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss an approach to calculate knot polynomials on a photonic processor. Calculations of knot polynomials is a computationally difficult problem and therefore it is interesting to use new advanced calculation methods to find them. Here we present a proof of concept by calculating the simplest knot polynomial of the trefoil knot in fundamental representation. This approach, however, can easily be generalized to more complex knots and representations. Same operators can also be realized on a quantum computer with the same effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.02545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an open-string realisation of $\mathcal{N}=2\to \mathcal{N}=0$ spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. It is based on type IIB orientifold theory compactified on $T^2\times T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$, with Scherk--Schwarz supersymmetry breaking implemented along $T^2$. We show that in the regions of moduli space where the supersymmetry breaking scale is lower than the other scales, there exist configurations with minima that have massless Bose-Fermi degeneracy and hence vanishing one-loop effective potential, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. These backgrounds describe non-Abelian gauge theories, with all open-string moduli and blowing up modes of $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$ stabilized, while all untwisted closed-string moduli remain flat directions. Other backgrounds with strictly positive effective potentials exist, where the only instabilities arising at one loop are associated with the supersymmetry breaking scale, which runs away. All of these backgrounds are consistent non-perturbatively.</description>

Abstract: Calabi-Yau manifolds can be obtained as hypersurfaces in toric varieties built from reflexive polytopes. We generate reflexive polytopes in various dimensions using a genetic algorithm. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that our algorithm reproduces the full set of reflexive polytopes in two and three dimensions, and in four dimensions with a small number of vertices and points. Motivated by this result, we construct five-dimensional reflexive polytopes with the lowest number of vertices and points. By calculating the normal form of the polytopes, we establish that many of these are not in existing datasets and therefore give rise to new Calabi-Yau four-folds. In some instances, the Hodge numbers we compute are new as well.</description>

Abstract: I explore whether distinguishing features of phase transitions and/or the inflationary energy scale can be imprinted on cosmological observables due to entanglement during inflation, given a spectator scalar field with a Higgs-like potential. As a consequence of this analysis, I also present results that illustrate the variety of features a Higgs-like spectator can imprint on the primordial power spectrum due to entanglement, as well as how easy it might be to distinguish such spectra from other similar scalar field results at the level of CMB residuals. I utilize the technical framework for dynamically generated entangled states developed in ( arXiv:2211.11079 [hep-th] , arXiv:2104.13410 [hep-th] ) to obtain my results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a $1+2$D Carrollian conformal field theory, the Ward identities of the two local fields $S^+_0$ and $S^+_1$, entirely built out of the Carrollian conformal stress-tensor, contain respectively up to the leading and the subleading positive helicity soft graviton theorems in the $1+3$D asymptotically flat space-time. This work investigates how the subsubleading soft graviton theorem can be encoded into the Ward identity of a Carrollian conformal field $S^+_2$. The operator product expansion (OPE) $S^+_2S^+_2$ is constructed using general Carrollian conformal symmetry principles and the OPE commutativity property, under the assumption that any time-independent, non-Identity field that is mutually local with $S^+_0,S^+_1,S^+_2$ has positive Carrollian scaling dimension. It is found that, for this OPE to be consistent, another local field $S^+_3$ must automatically exist in the theory. The presence of an infinite tower of local fields $S^+_{k\geq3}$ is then revealed iteratively as a consistency condition for the $S^+_2S^+_{k-1}$ OPE. The general $S^+_kS^+_l$ OPE is similarly obtained and the symmetry algebra manifest in this OPE is found to be the Kac-Moody algebra of the wedge sub-algebra of $w_{1+\infty}$. The Carrollian time-coordinate plays the central role in this purely holographic construction. The 2D Celestial conformally soft graviton primary $H^k(z,\bar{z})$ is realized to be contained in the Carrollian conformal primary $S_{1-k}^+(t,z,\bar{z})$. Finally, the existence of the infinite tower of fields $S^+_{k}$ is shown to be directly related to an infinity of positive helicity soft graviton theorems.</description>

Abstract: A key issue in both the field of quantum chaos and quantum gravity is an effective description of chaotic conformal field theories (CFTs), that is CFTs that have a quantum ergodic limit. We develop a framework incorporating the constraints of conformal symmetry and locality, allowing the definition of ensembles of `CFT data'. These ensembles take on the same role as the ensembles of random Hamiltonians in more conventional quantum ergodic phases of many-body quantum systems. To describe individual members of the ensembles, we introduce the notion of approximate CFT, defined as a collection of `CFT data' satisfying the usual CFT constraints approximately, i.e. up to small deviations. We show that they generically exist by providing concrete examples. Ensembles of approximate CFTs are very natural in holography, as every member of the ensemble is indistinguishable from a true CFT for low-energy probes that only have access to information from semi-classical gravity. To specify these ensembles, we impose successively higher moments of the CFT constraints. Lastly, we propose a theory of pure gravity in AdS$_3$ as a random matrix/tensor model implementing approximate CFT constraints. This tensor model is the maximum ignorance ensemble compatible with conformal symmetry, crossing invariance, and a primary gap to the black-hole threshold. The resulting theory is a random matrix/tensor model governed by the Virasoro 6j-symbol.</description>

Abstract: We attempt to tackle to computation of genus-$g$, $n$-point, $b$-boundary, $c$-crosscap correlation functions with $x$ boundary operators $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$). We show that $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ are infinite linear combinations of genus-$g$, $(n+b+c)$-point functions $\mathcal{F}_{g,(n+b+c)}$, and try to obtain the linear coefficients in this work. We show the existence of a single pole structure in the linear coefficients. A practical method to obtain the infinite linear coefficients is the free field realizations of Ishibashi states. We review the results in Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(p,p')$ and extend it to the $N=1$ minimal models $\mathcal{SM}(p,p')$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the quantization of Yang-Mills theory in the de Sitter spacetime. It is observed that the Faddeev--Popov ghost propagator is divergent in this spacetime. However, this divergence is removed by using an effective propagator, which is suitable for perturbation theory. To show that the quantization of Yang--Mills theory in the de Sitter is consistent, we quantize it using first-class constraints in the temporal gauge. We also demonstrate that this is equivalent to quantizing the theory in the Lorentz gauge.</description>

Abstract: One-loop scattering amplitudes in string theories involve configuration-space integrals over genus-one surfaces with coefficients of Kronecker-Eisenstein series in the integrand. A conjectural genus-one basis of integrands under Fay identities and integration by parts was recently constructed out of chains of Kronecker-Eisenstein series. In this work, we decompose a variety of more general genus-one integrands into the conjectural chain basis. The explicit form of the expansion coefficients is worked out for infinite families of cases where the Kronecker-Eisenstein series form cycles. Our results can be used to simplify multiparticle amplitudes in supersymmetric, heterotic and bosonic string theories and to investigate loop-level echoes of the field-theory double-copy structures of string tree-level amplitudes. The multitude of basis reductions in this work strongly validate the recently proposed chain basis and stimulate mathematical follow-up studies of more general configuration-space integrals with additional marked points or at higher genus.</description>

Abstract: We analyze correlation functions of $SU(k) \times SU(2)_F$ flavor currents in a family of three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories, combining analytic bootstrap methods with input from supersymmetric localization. Via holographic duality, we extract gluon and graviton scattering amplitudes of M-theory on ${\rm AdS}_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$ which contains a $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ orbifold singularity. From these results, we derive aspects of the effective description of M-theory on the orbifold singularity beyond its leading low energy limit. We also determine a threshold correction to the holographic correlator from the combined contribution of two-loop gluon and tree-level bulk graviton exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum decoherence in a class of models which interpolates between expanding (inflation) and contracting (ekpyrosis) scenarios. For the cases which result in a scale-invariant power spectrum, we find that ekpyrotic universes lead to complete decoherence of the curvature perturbation before the bounce. This is in stark contrast to the inflationary case, where recoherence has been previously observed in some situations. Although the purity can be computed for couplings of all sizes, we also study the purity perturbatively and observe that late-time (secular growth) breakdown of perturbation theory often occurs in these cases. Instead, we establish a simple yet powerful late-time purity resummation which captures the exact evolution to a remarkable level, while maintaining analytical control. We conclude that the cosmological background plays a crucial role in the decoupling of the heavy fields during inflation and alternatives.</description>

Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and the classical limit of the S-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationships between classical observables in cosmology and the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes. We first look at the relation between Bogoliubov transformations and the notion of classical limit. Then, we compute the cosmological redshift for a particle in a cosmological background and the emitted gravitational waveform from a quantum field theory basis and its classical limit. We observe that there is no interpretation for the geodesic redshift purely in terms of on-shell amplitudes in flat space, given that the classical limit of a scalar 2-point vanishes when considering an FRW background with two asymptotically flat in and out regions. We resolve this apparent conundrum and recover the correct observable by showing that the action of Hermitian operators differ between the in and out regions, unlike standard approaches in flat spacetime. We then show that radiation reaction corrections to the redshift enter already at order $G$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the emitted waveform can be represented solely in terms of an on-shell 3-point amplitude in flat space without energy conservation, providing a closed formula for the waveform in an impulsive FRW.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>

      <title>The universal thermodynamic properties of Extremely Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extremely compact object (ECO) is defined as a quantum object without horizon, whose radius is just a small distance $s$ outside its Schwarzschild radius. We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic model that exhibits a coexistence state of the Weyl semimetal and the topological nodal line state, providing us with a valuable tool to investigate the system's behavior in the strong coupling regime. Nine types of bulk solutions exhibiting different IR behaviors have been identified, corresponding to nine different types of boundary states. These nine states include four distinct phases, namely the Weyl-nodal phase, the gap-nodal phase, the Weyl gap phase and the gap-gap phase, four phase boundaries, which are the Weyl-Dirac phase, the gap-Dirac phase, the Dirac-gap phase and the Dirac-nodal phase, and finally a double critical point. A phase diagram is plotted that exhibits qualitative similarity to the one obtained in the weak coupling limit. The anomalous Hall conductivity, which serves as an order parameter, and the free energy are calculated, with the latter showing the continuity of the topological phase transitions within the system. Our study highlights the similarities and differences in such a topological system between the weak and strong coupling regimes, paving the way for further experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fourth Post-Minkowskian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging scattering information to describe binary systems in generic orbits requires identifying local- and nonlocal-in-time tail effects. We report here the derivation of the universal (non-spinning) local-in-time conservative dynamics at fourth Post-Minkowskian order, i.e. ${\cal O}(G^4)$. This is achieved by computing the nonlocal-in-time contribution to the deflection angle, and removing it from the full conservative value in [2112.11296,2210.05541]. Unlike the total result, the integration problem involves two scales, velocity and mass ratio, and features multiple polylogarithms, complete elliptic and iterated elliptic integrals, notably in the mass ratio. We reconstruct the local radial action, center-of-mass momentum and Hamiltonian, as well as the exact logarithmic-dependent part(s), all valid for generic orbits. We incorporate the remaining nonlocal terms for elliptic-like motion to sixth Post-Newtonian order. The combined Hamiltonian is in perfect agreement in the overlap with the Post-Newtonian state of the art. The results presented here provide the most accurate description of gravitationally-bound binaries harnessing scattering data to date, readily applicable to waveform modelling.</description>

      <title>Higher time-derivative theories from space-time interchanged integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare a relativistic and a nonrelativistic version of Ostrogradsky's method for higher-time derivative theories extended to scalar field theories and consider as an alternative a multi-field variant. We apply the schemes to space-time rotated modified Korteweg-de Vries systems and, exploiting their integrability, to Hamiltonian systems built from space-time rotated inverse Legendre transformed higher-order charges of these systems. We derive the equal-time Poisson bracket structures of these theories, establish the integrability of the latter theories by means of the Painlev\'e test and construct exact analytical period benign solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions to the classical equations of motion. The classical energies of these partially complex solutions are real when they respect a certain modified CPT-symmetry and complex when this symmetry is broken. The higher order Cauchy and initial-boundary value problem are addressed analytically and numerically. Finally, we provide the explicit quantization of the simplest mKdV system, exhibiting the usual conundrum of having the choice between either having to deal with a theory that includes non-normalizable states or spectra that are unbounded from below. In our non-Hermitian system the choice is dictated by the correct sign in the decay width.</description>

Exploiting the difference-form of the massless scattering theory, we find a very simple and exhaustive list of reflection matrices for all the possible boundary coideal subalgebras - singlet and vector representations, right and left boundary - and check basic properties of our solutions, primarily the boundary Yang-Baxter equation, for all possible combinations of scattering particles.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Bardeen Black Hole in 5-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addressed the scalar field quasinormal ringing behavior of black holes. We investigated scalar field perturbations in Bardeen black hole spacetime in 5-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Using the 3rd-order WKB approximation and the finite-difference method, we computed the frequency of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spacetime background. The calculations demonstrated that the real part of the QNMs $\omega$ increased, whereas the imaginary part decreased with increase in the magnetic charge parameter $Q$ of the Bardeen black hole for a fixed Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\alpha$. This was also valid when $Q$ was fixed and $\alpha$ increased; where in the real part of the QNMs increased and the absolute value of the imaginary part decreased. However, the change in the latter case was more significant than that in the former; thus, the frequency of eigenvibration of this black hole background under the scalar field perturbation increased and the decay of eigenvibration decreased with increase in $\alpha$ or $Q^2$. Moreover, this result shows that the effect of $\alpha$ on the intrinsic vibration of this black hole was greater than that of $Q $.Finally we found an interesting phenomenon by comparing black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. With higher dimensions, the real part of the QNMs changes more obviously, but the imaginary part of the QNMs is almost unchanged. This phenomenon also indicates that the frequency of gravitational waves released by higher dimensional black holes becomes larger, but the decay rate is almost constant.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively. Since the various quantum gravitational framework could lead to this kind of modified dispersion relation and non-trivial sound speed, so that our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. $(a)$. The numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. $(b)$. The numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. $(c)$. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. Our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects and the Krylov complexity will always increase without thermal effect. $(d)$. We also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter the universe is, the more chaotic the universe becomes. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

Abstract: The effective interaction of a neutrino with a photon in magnetized plasma is obtained from a strong field expansion in the electroweak standard model. The interaction is expressed by a Chern-Simons form of the neutrino current and the electromagnetic vector potential of the coupling strength proportional to $\frac{n_e}{B} \times e G_F$. The derivation of the interaction Lagrangian and its properties are presented.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of defect excitations in crystalline solids is necessary to understand the macroscopic low-energy properties of elastic media. We use fracton-elasticity duality to systematically study the defect dynamics and interactions in the linear isotropic medium. We derive the explicit expressions for the dual gauge potentials for moving dislocations and the resulting Jefimenko equations. We also compute stresses and strains. The paper includes two physical situations: when the vacancy number is fixed and when the number is fluctuating. If defects are present we show a constraint that needs to be satisfied by them when they climb perpendicularly to their Burgers vector. Next, we extend the classic result of Peach and Koehler for the force between two dislocations and show that, similarly, to moving charges in electrodynamics, it is non-reciprocal, when one dislocation is moving. We argue that our formalism can be extended beyond Cauchy's elasticity by exploiting the simplifications provided by the dual gauge formulation of elastic stresses.</description>

      <title>Probing the interference between non-linear, axionic and space-time-anisotropy effects in the QED vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the investigation of a generic non-linear extension of axionic electrodynamics in a Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) scenario that implements Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV). The model we inspect consists of an arbitrary non-linear electrodynamic action coupled to the axion field in presence of an anisotropy four-vector that realizes the breaking of Lorentz symmetry under the particle point of view. The non-linear electromagnetic field is expanded around a constant and uniform magnetic background up to second order in the propagating photon field. The focus of our attention is the study of the material properties of the vacuum in the particular case of a space-like CFJ $4$-vector. The dispersion relations associated to the plane wave solutions are explicitly worked out in two situations: the magnetic background perpendicular and parallel to the wave direction. We extend these results to consider the analysis of the birefringence phenomenon in presence of non-linearity, the axion and the LSV manifested through the spatial anisotropy. Three specific proposals of non-linear electrodynamics are contemplated: Euler-Heisenberg, Born-Infeld and the Modified Maxwell electrodynamics. Throughout the paper, we shall justify why we follow the unusual path of connecting, in a single Lagrangian density, three pieces of physics beyond the Standard Model, namely, non-linearity, axions and LSV. Our true goal is to actually inspect and describe how axionic, non-linear and LSV effects interfere with one another whenever physical entities like group velocity, refraction indices, birefringence and effective masses of physical excitations are computed in presence of an external constant and homogeneous magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the state of current constraints on the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w$. Our study is motivated by the observation that, while broadly consistent with the cosmological constant value $w=-1$, several independent probes appear to point towards a slightly phantom EoS ($w \sim -1.03$) which, if confirmed, could have important implications for the Hubble tension. We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset $w=-1.013^{+0.038}_{-0.043}$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value. Overall, despite a few scattered hints, we find no compelling evidence forcing us away from the cosmological constant (yet).</description>

      <title>Suppression of spacetime singularities in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the requirement of suppressing spacetime geometries with a curvature singularity via destructive interference in the Lorentzian gravitational path integral as a constraint on the microscopic action for gravity. Based on simple examples of static spherically symmetric spacetimes, we demonstrate that complete singularity suppression in the path integral stipulates that the action for gravity be of infinite order in the curvature.</description>

      <title>Solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points: Loop soups of 1+1D conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points by attaching 1+1D conformal field theories (CFTs) to fluctuating domain walls forming a ``loop soup''. Specifically, our local Hamiltonian attaches gapless spin chains to the domain walls of a triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet. The macroscopic degeneracy between antiferromagnetic configurations is split by the Casimir energy of each decorating CFT, which is usually negative and thus favors a short loop phase with a finite gap. However, we found a set of 1D CFT Hamiltonians for which the Casimir energy is effectively positive, making it favorable for domain walls to coalesce into a single ``snake'' which is macroscopically long and thus hosts a CFT with a vanishing gap. The snake configurations are geometrical objects also known as fully-packed self-avoiding walks or Hamiltonian walks which are described by an $\mathrm{O}(n=0)$ loop ensemble with a non-unitary 2+0D CFT description. Combining this description with the 1+1D decoration CFT, we obtain a 2+1D theory with unusual critical exponents and entanglement properties. Regarding the latter, we show that the $\log$ contributions from the decoration CFTs conspire with the spatial distribution of loops crossing the entanglement cut to generate a ``non-local area law''. Our predictions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum many-body mixed states with a symmetry from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) symmetric pure states. We provide evidence for 'symmetry-enforced separability transitions' in a variety of states, where in one regime the mixed state is expressible as a convex sum of symmetric SRE pure states, while in the other regime, such a representation is not feasible. We first discuss Gibbs state of Hamiltonians that exhibit spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, and argue that the associated thermal phase transition can be thought of as a symmetry-enforced separability transition. Next, we study cluster states in various dimensions subjected to local decoherence, and identify several distinct mixed-state phases and associated separability phase transitions, which also provides an alternate perspective on recently discussed 'average SPT order'. We also study decohered p+ip superconductors, and find that if the decoherence breaks the fermion parity explicitly, then the resulting mixed state can be expressed as a convex sum of non-chiral states, while a fermion-parity preserving decoherence results in a phase transition at a non-zero threshold that corresponds to spontaneous breaking of fermion parity. Finally, we briefly discuss systems that satisfy NLTS (no low-energy trivial state) property, such as the recently discovered good LDPC codes, and argue that the Gibbs state of such systems exhibits a temperature-tuned separability transition.</description>

      <title>Search for Non-Tensorial Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds in the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a stochastic signal in the NANOGrav 15-year data set has aroused great interest in uncovering its origin. However, the evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlations, a key signature of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by general relativity, remains inconclusive. In this letter, we search for an isotropic non-tensorial GWB, allowed by general metric theories of gravity, in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Our analysis reveals a Bayes factor of approximately 2.5, comparing the quadrupolar (tensor transverse, TT) correlations to the scalar transverse (ST) correlations, suggesting that the ST correlations provide a comparable explanation for the observed stochastic signal in the NANOGrav data. We obtain the median and the $90\%$ equal-tail amplitudes as $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{ST} = 7.8^{+5.1}_{-3.5} \times 10^{-15}$ at the frequency of 1/year. Furthermore, we find that the vector longitudinal (VL) and scalar longitudinal (SL) correlations are weakly and strongly disfavoured by data, respectively, yielding upper limits on the amplitudes: $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{VL}^{95\%} \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-15}$ and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{SL}^{95\%} \lesssim 7.4 \times 10^{-17}$. Lastly, we fit the NANOGrav data with the general transverse (GT) correlations parameterized by a free parameter $\alpha$. Our analysis yields $\alpha=1.74^{+1.18}_{-1.41}$, thus excluding both the TT ($\alpha=3$) and ST ($\alpha=0$) models at the $90\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>A Realist Interpretation of Unitarity in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity is a difficult concept to implement in canonical quantum gravity because of state non-normalizability and the problem of time. We take a realist approach based on pilot-wave theory to address this issue in the Ashtekar formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We use the postulate of a definite configuration in the theory to define a global time for the gravitational-fermionic system recently discussed in (Phys. Rev. D 106.10 (2022): 106012), by parameterizing a variation of a Weyl-spinor that depends on the Kodama state. The total Hamiltonian constraint yields a time-dependent Schrodinger equation, without semi-classical approximations, which we use to derive a local continuity equation over the configuration space. We implement the reality conditions at the level of the guidance equation, and obtain a real spin-connection, extrinsic curvature and triad along the system trajectory. We obtain quantum corrections to deSitter spacetime from the guidance equation. The non-normalizable Kodama state is naturally factored out of the full quantum state in the conserved current density, opening the possibility for quantum-mechanical unitarity. We also give a pilot-wave generalisation of the notion of unitarity applicable to non-normalizable states, and show the existence of equilibrium density for our system. Lastly, we find unitary states in mini-superspace by finding an approximate solution to the Hamiltonian constraint.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa--modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa--like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton's law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking on Axion Like Particles as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion like particles (ALPs), the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous breaking of global symmetry, have emerged as promising dark matter candidates. Conventionally, in the context of misalignment mechanism, the non-thermally produced ALPs happen to stay frozen due to Hubble friction initially and at a later stage, they begin to oscillate (before matter-radiation equality) at characteristic frequencies defined by their masses and behaving like cold dark matter. In this work, we study the influence of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), through a higher order Higgs portal interaction, on the evolution of ALPs. Such an interaction is found to contribute partially to the ALP's mass during EWSB, thereby modifying oscillation frequencies during EWSB as well as impacting upon the existing correlation between the scale of symmetry breaking and their masses. The novelty of the work lies in broadening the relic satisfied parameter space so as to probe it in near future via a wide range of experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytical Insights into Constant-Roll Condition: Extending the Paradigm to Non-Canonical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the prospect of generalizing the constant-roll condition in canonical inflationary model to non-canonical models. To find a natural generalization, we focus on three manifestations of this condition and construct constant-roll models corresponding to each manifestation. These models are not equivalent but reduce to the familiar constant-roll model in canonical limit. To showcase the applicability of our generalized mechanism, we examine a specific class of non-canonical models, which can be viewed as extensions of k/G inflation. In these models sound speed is constant. We conduct a comparative study, and with an analytical examination of the model, specify instances when our constant-roll conditions yield dissimilar outcomes and when they exhibit analogies. We also apply our findings to scrutinize another kinetically driven inflationary model with varying sound speed. We demonstrate that each of our constant-roll conditions leads to a unique set of solutions. Afterward, we construct a four-stage constant-roll kinetically driven inflation that complies with CMB constraints, it sustains for a sufficiently long period of time, and finally gracefully exits. In this model the spectrum of curvature perturbations is enhanced in a brief phase of non-slow-roll inflationary evolution. Employing numerical methods, we analyse this scenario to elucidate how altering the constant-roll condition impacts the power spectrum and the model's dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements, we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more generally.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral approach to the kinetics of black hole phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the approach of path integral in the phase space to study the kinetics of state switching associated with black hole phase transitions. Under the assumption that the state switching process of the black hole is described by the stochastic Langevin equation based on the free energy landscape, we derived the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional and obtained the path integral expression of the transition probability. The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process. For the Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point, the state switching processes between the small, the intermediate and the large Gauss-Bonnet black holes constitute a chemical reaction cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that conformal symmetry is an emergent property of many systems at their critical point. This imposes strong constraints on the critical behavior of a given system. Taking them into account in theoretical approaches can lead to a better understanding of the critical physics or improve approximation schemes. However, within the framework of the non-perturbative or functional renormalization group and, in particular, of one of its most used approximation schemes, the Derivative Expansion (DE), non-trivial constraints only apply from third order (usually denoted $\mathcal{O}(\partial^4)$), at least in the usual formulation of the DE that includes correlation functions involving only the order parameter. In this work, we implement conformal constraints on a generalized DE including composite operators and show that new constraints already appear at second order of the DE (or $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$). We show how these constraints can be used to fix nonphysical regulator parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals are emerging for the experimental detection of entanglement mediated by classical gravity, carrying significant theoretical and observational implications. In fact, the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in LIGO provides an alternative laboratory for testing various gravity-related properties. By employing LIGO's arms as oscillators interacting with gravitational waves (GWs), our study demonstrates the potential for generating quantum entanglement between two mutually orthogonal modes of simple harmonic oscillators. Our findings reveal unique entanglement dynamics, including periodic "collapse and revival" influenced by GW oscillations, alongside a distinct "quantum memory effect." Effectively, each harmonic oscillator feels a temperature. We believe that these forecasts may hold significance towards both theoretically probing and experimentally verifying various properties of classical gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

Abstract: Fractional differential calculus is a mathematical tool that has found applications in the study of social and physical behaviors considered ``anomalous''. It is often used when traditional integer derivatives models fail to represent cases where the power law is observed accurately. Fractional calculus must reflect non-local, frequency- and history-dependent properties of power-law phenomena. This tool has various important applications, such as fractional mass conservation, electrochemical analysis, groundwater flow problems, and fractional spatiotemporal diffusion equations. It can also be used in cosmology to explain late-time cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. We review some models using fractional differential equations. We look at the Einstein--Hilbert action, which is based on a fractional derivative action, and add a scalar field, $\phi$, to create a non-minimal interaction theory with the coupling, $\xi R \phi^2 $, between gravity and the scalar field, where $\xi$ is the interaction constant. By employing various mathematical approaches, we can offer precise schemes to find analytical and numerical approximations of the solutions. Moreover, we comprehensively study the modified cosmological equations and analyze the solution space using the theory of dynamical systems and asymptotic expansion methods. This enables us to provide a qualitative description of cosmologies with a scalar field based on fractional calculus formalism.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis, which is used to quantify quantum complexity, and the entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and the Krylov entropy is the counterpart the entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD, but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006 (cf. Ref. [42]), called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model'. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of this model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution. Finally, our approach favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>
