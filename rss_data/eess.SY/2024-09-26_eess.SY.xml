      <title>Transformer based time series prediction of the maximum power point for solar photovoltaic cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved deep learning based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar photovoltaic cells considering various time series based environmental inputs. Generally, artificial neural network based MPPT algorithms use basic neural network architectures and inputs which do not represent the ambient conditions in a comprehensive manner. In this article, the ambient conditions of a location are represented through a comprehensive set of environmental features. Furthermore, the inclusion of time based features in the input data is considered to model cyclic patterns temporally within the atmospheric conditions leading to robust modeling of the MPPT algorithm. A transformer based deep learning architecture is trained as a time series prediction model using multidimensional time series input features. The model is trained on a dataset containing typical meteorological year data points of ambient weather conditions from 50 locations. The attention mechanism in the transformer modules allows the model to learn temporal patterns in the data efficiently. The proposed model achieves a 0.47% mean average percentage error of prediction on non zero operating voltage points in a test dataset consisting of data collected over a period of 200 consecutive hours resulting in the average power efficiency of 99.54% and peak power efficiency of 99.98%. The proposed model is validated through real time simulations. The proposed model performs power point tracking in a robust, dynamic, and nonlatent manner, over a wide range of atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Active Perception with Initial-State Uncertainty: A Policy Gradient Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the synthesis of an active perception policy that maximizes the information leakage of the initial state in a stochastic system modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM). Specifically, the emission function of the HMM is controllable with a set of perception or sensor query actions. Given the goal is to infer the initial state from partial observations in the HMM, we use Shannon conditional entropy as the planning objective and develop a novel policy gradient method with convergence guarantees. By leveraging a variant of observable operators in HMMs, we prove several important properties of the gradient of the conditional entropy with respect to the policy parameters, which allow efficient computation of the policy gradient and stable and fast convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by applying it to an inference problem in a stochastic grid world environment.</description>

      <title>A Fast Dynamic Internal Predictive Power Scheduling Approach for Power Management in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Dynamic Internal Predictive Power Scheduling (DIPPS) approach for optimizing power management in microgrids, particularly focusingon external power exchanges among diverse prosumers. DIPPS utilizes a dynamic objective function with a time-varying binary parameter to control the timing of power transfers to the external grid, facilitated by efficient usage of energy storage for surplus renewable power. The microgrid power scheduling problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programmig (MINLP-PS) and subsequently transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP-PS) optimization through McCormick's relaxation to reduce the computational complexity. A predictive window with 6 data points is solved at an average of 0.92s, a 97.6% improvement over the 38.27s required for the MINLP-PS formulation, implying the numerical feasibility of the DIPPS approach for real-time implementation. Finally, the approach is validated against a static objective using real-world load data across three case studies with different time-varying parameters, demonstrationg the ability of DIPPS to optimize power exchanges and efficiently utilize distributed resources whie shifting the eexternal power transfers to specified time durations.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Separation Principle for Data-driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of a separation principle between model identification and control design in the context of model predictive control. First, we elucidate that the separation principle holds asymptotically in the number of data in a Fisherian setting, and universally in a Bayesian setting. Then, by formulating model predictive control within a Gaussian regression framework, we describe how the Bayesian separation principle can be used to derive explicit, uncertainty-aware expressions for the control cost and optimal input sequence, thereby bridging direct and indirect data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Non-Linear Control of Offshore MMC Grids for Asymmetrical AC Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault ride-through capability studies of MMC-HVDC connected wind power plants have focused primarily on the DC link and onshore AC grid faults. Offshore AC faults, mainly asymmetrical faults have not gained much attention in the literature despite being included in the future development at national levels in the ENTSO-E HVDC code. The proposed work gives an event-triggered control to stabilize the system once the offshore AC fault has occurred, identified, and isolated. Different types of control actions such as proportional-integral (PI) controller and super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) are used to smoothly transition the post-fault system to a new steady state operating point by suppressing the negative sequence control. Initially, the effect of a negative sequence current control scheme on the transient behavior of the power system with a PI controller is discussed in this paper. Further, a non-linear control strategy (STSMC) is proposed which gives quicker convergence of the system post-fault in comparison to PI control action. These post-fault control operations are only triggered in the presence of a fault in the system, i.e., they are event-triggered. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation on a $\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Single-Terminal Fault Location for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying faulty lines and their accurate location is key for rapidly restoring distribution systems. This will become a greater challenge as the penetration of power electronics increases, and contingencies are seen across larger areas. This paper proposes a single terminal methodology (i.e., no communication involved) that is robust to variations of key parameters (e.g., sampling frequency, system parameters, etc.) and performs particularly well for low resistance faults that constitute the majority of faults in low voltage DC systems. The proposed method uses local measurements to estimate the current caused by the other terminals affected by the contingency. This mimics the strategy followed by double terminal methods that require communications and decouples the accuracy of the methodology from the fault resistance. The algorithm takes consecutive voltage and current samples, including the estimated current of the other terminal, into the analysis. This mathematical methodology results in a better accuracy than other single-terminal approaches found in the literature. The robustness of the proposed strategy against different fault resistances and locations is demonstrated using MATLAB simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance Boundary Analyses for Statistical Multi-QoS Framework Over 6G SAGINs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable the cost-effective universal access and the enhancement of current communication services, the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) have recently been developed due to its exceptional 3D coverage and the ability to guarantee rigorous and multidimensional demands for quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, including delay and reliability across vast distances. In response to the complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic serving scenarios and stringent performance expectations for 6G SAGINs, it is crucial to undertake modeling, assurance, and analysis of the key technologies, aligned with the diverse demands for QoS provisioning in the non-asymptotic regime, i.e., when implementing finite blocklength coding (FBC) as a new dimension for error-rate bounded QoS metric. However, how to design new statistical QoS-driven performance modeling approaches that accurately delineate the complex and dynamic behaviors of networks, particularly in terms of constraining both delay and error rate, persists as a significant challenge for implementing mURLLC within 6G SAGINs in the finite blocklength regime. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose to develop a set of analytical modeling frameworks for 6G SAGIN in supporting statistical delay and error-rate bounded QoS in the finite blocklength regime. First we establish the SAGIN system architecture model. Second, the aggregate interference and decoding error probability functions are modeled and examined through using Laplace transform. Third, we introduce modeling techniques aimed at defining the$\epsilon$-effective capacity function as a crucial metric for facilitating statistical QoS standards with respect to delay and error-rate. To validate the effectiveness of the developed performance modeling schemes, we have executed a series of simulations over SAGINs.</description>

      <title>Measurements and System Identification for the Characterization of Smooth Muscle Cell Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissue integrity is actively maintained by cells. It is essential to comprehend how cells accomplish this in order to stage tissue diseases. However, addressing the complexity of a cell's system of interrelated mechanisms poses a challenge. This necessitates a well-structured identification framework and an effective integration of measurements. Here we introduce the use of state-of-the-art frequency-domain system identification techniques combined with an indentation measurement platform to analyze the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of control system theory. The ultimate goal is to explore how mechanical and biological factors are related in induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells. We study on the frequency-domain analysis for the investigation and characterization of cellular dynamics of smooth muscle cells from the measured data. The measurement model in this study exploits the availability of human tissue and samples, enabling fundamental investigations of vascular tissue disease. This approach using human cell lines holds significant potential to decrease the necessity for animal-based safety and efficacy studies. The focus of this review is to investigate the cellular dynamics underlying the myogenic response and to demonstrate the practicability of employing a nano-indentation measurement setup for the broadband frequency-domain characterization of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells.</description>

      <title>Feedforward Controllers from Learned Dynamic Local Model Networks with Application to Excavator Assistance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complicated first principles modelling and controller synthesis can be prohibitively slow and expensive for high-mix, low-volume products such as hydraulic excavators. Instead, in a data-driven approach, recorded trajectories from the real system can be used to train local model networks (LMNs), for which feedforward controllers are derived via feedback linearization. However, previous works required LMNs without zero dynamics for feedback linearization, which restricts the model structure and thus modelling capacity of LMNs. In this paper, we overcome this restriction by providing a criterion for when feedback linearization of LMNs with zero dynamics yields a valid controller. As a criterion we propose the bounded-input bounded-output stability of the resulting controller. In two additional contributions, we extend this approach to consider measured disturbance signals and multiple inputs and outputs. We illustrate the effectiveness of our contributions in a hydraulic excavator control application with hardware experiments. To this end, we train LMNs from recorded, noisy data and derive feedforward controllers used as part of a leveling assistance system on the excavator. In our experiments, incorporating disturbance signals and multiple inputs and outputs enhances tracking performance of the learned controller. A video of our experiments is available at https://youtu.be/lrrWBx2ASaE.</description>

      <title>The Power-Oriented Graphs Modeling Technique: From the Fundamental Principles to the Systematic, Step-by-Step Modeling of Complex Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling physical systems is an essential skill for a control engineer, since it enables to achieve a deep understanding of their dynamic behavior and, consequently, the development of effective control strategies. The first part of this article provides a tutorial description of the fundamental principles and properties of the Power-Oriented Graphs (POG) modeling technique. Various case studies in different energetic domains are then presented to consolidate the fundamental principles, each highlighting different features of the POG modeling technique. The latter is then compared with the other two main graphical modeling techniques available in the literature, namely Bond Graph (BG) and Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR). The second part of this article assumes once again a tutorial nature, in order to introduce the new Fast Modeling POG (FMPOG) procedure. The FMPOG, which operates in the POG framework, is a methodical step-by-step procedure that enables the readers to quickly derive the power-oriented graphical model of physical systems starting from their schematics. From the power-oriented graphical model, the state-space model can then be directly determined. To ensure the FMPOG procedure is easily usable by the entire community, we apply it to three examples in different energetic domains in this article, guiding the reader step-by-step through the derivation of the physical systems models.</description>

      <title>A Novel MOSFET based Single Event Latchup Detection, Current Limiting &amp; Self Power Cycling circuit for Spacecraft systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Event Latch-up (SEL) is one of the prime concerns for CMOS ICs used in space systems. Galactic Cosmic Rays or Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) may trigger the parasitic latch up circuit in CMOS ICs and cause increase in current beyond the safe limits thereby presenting a threat of permanent failure of the IC. Mitigation of the SEL is always a challenging task. The conventional mitigation approaches inherently introduce some response time which presents an uncertainty because during this response time the current may exceed the safe current limits. This paper presents a novel circuit based on MOSFETs which provides end-to-end complete solution of detecting SEL, limiting the current below the set threshold and executing power cycling to restore the normal functioning of the CMOS IC. The proposed circuit has been simulated in MULTISIM and the simulation results match very well with the expected behavior of (i)current limiting and (ii) the total time duration taken in power cycling to bring the SEL sensitive device back to its normal operational state. This circuit can be harnessed by spacecraft system designers to overcome the catastrophic threat of SEL posed by space radiation environment.</description>

      <title>Energy efficiency analysis as a function of the working voltages in supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercapacitors are increasingly used as energy storage elements. Unlike batteries, their state of charge has a considerable influence on their voltage in normal operation, allowing them to work from zero to their maximum voltage. In this work, a theoretical and practical analysis is proposed of the energy efficiency of these devices according to their working voltages. To this end, several supercapacitors were subjected to charge and discharge cycles until the measurements of current and voltage stabilized. At this point their energy efficiency was calculated. These charge-discharge cycles were carried out: i) without rest between charging and discharging; and ii) with a rest of several minutes between the two stages. Using the information obtained from the tests, the energy efficiency is shown plotted against the minimum and maximum working voltages. By consulting the data and the graphs, the ideal working voltages to optimize the energy efficiency of these devices can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Generic Diagonalizability, Structural Functional Observability and Output Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structural functional observability (SFO) and structural output controllability (SOC) of a class of systems with generically diagonalizable state matrices and explores the associated minimal sensor and actuator placement problems. The verification of SOC and the corresponding sensor and actuator placement problems, i.e., the problems of determining the minimum number of outputs and inputs required to achieve SFO and SOC, respectively, are yet open for general systems, which motivates our focus on a class of systems enabling polynomial-time solutions. In this line, we first define and characterize generically diagonalizable systems, referring to structured systems for which almost all realizations of the state matrices are diagonalizable. We then develop computationally efficient criteria for SFO and SOC within the context of generically diagonalizable systems. Our work expands the class of systems amenable to polynomial-time SOC verification. Thanks to the simplicity of the obtained criteria, we derive closed-form solutions for determining the minimal sensor placement to achieve SFO and the minimal actuator deployment to achieve SOC in such systems, along with efficient weighted maximum matching based and weighted maximum flow based algorithms. For more general systems to achieve SFO, an upper bound is given by identifying a non-decreasing property of SFO with respect to a specific class of edge additions, which is shown to be optimal under certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Complex-Phase, Data-Driven Identification of Grid-Forming Inverter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into power systems requires the deployment of grid-forming inverters to ensure a stable operation. Accurate modeling of these devices is necessary. In this paper, a system identification approach to obtain low-dimensional models of grid-forming inverters is presented. The proposed approach is based on a Hammerstein-Wiener parametrization of the normal-form model. The normal-form is a gray-box model that utilizes complex frequency and phase to capture non-linear inverter dynamics. The model is validated on two well-known control strategies: droop-control and dispatchable virtual oscillators. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the normal-form accurately models inverter dynamics across various operating conditions. The approach shows great potential for enhancing the modeling of RES-dominated power systems, especially when component models are unavailable or computationally expensive.</description>

      <title>Learning with Dynamics: Autonomous Regulation of UAV Based Communication Networks with Dynamic UAV Crew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication networks (UCNs) are a key component in future mobile networking. To handle the dynamic environments in UCNs, reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising solution attributed to its strong capability of adaptive decision-making free of the environment models. However, most existing RL-based research focus on control strategy design assuming a fixed set of UAVs. Few works have investigated how UCNs should be adaptively regulated when the serving UAVs change dynamically. This article discusses RL-based strategy design for adaptive UCN regulation given a dynamic UAV set, addressing both reactive strategies in general UCNs and proactive strategies in solar-powered UCNs. An overview of the UCN and the RL framework is first provided. Potential research directions with key challenges and possible solutions are then elaborated. Some of our recent works are presented as case studies to inspire innovative ways to handle dynamic UAV crew with different RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Gait Switching and Enhanced Stabilization of Walking Robots with Deep Learning-based Reachability: A Case Study on Two-link Walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches have recently shown notable success in legged locomotion. However, these approaches often lack accountability, necessitating empirical tests to determine their effectiveness. In this work, we are interested in designing a learning-based locomotion controller whose stability can be examined and guaranteed. This can be achieved by verifying regions of attraction (RoAs) of legged robots to their stable walking gaits. This is a non-trivial problem for legged robots due to their hybrid dynamics. Although previous work has shown the utility of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability to solve this problem, its practicality was limited by its poor scalability. The core contribution of our work is the employment of a deep learning-based HJ reachability solution to the hybrid legged robot dynamics, which overcomes the previous work's limitation. With the learned reachability solution, first, we can estimate a library of RoAs for various gaits. Second, we can design a one-step predictive controller that effectively stabilizes to an individual gait within the verified RoA. Finally, we can devise a strategy that switches gaits, in response to external perturbations, whose feasibility is guided by the RoA analysis. We demonstrate our method in a two-link walker simulation, whose mathematical model is well established. Our method achieves improved stability than previous model-based methods, while ensuring transparency that was not present in the existing learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling of Day-Ahead Wind Power Generation with Input-Warped Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a Gaussian Process (GP) spatiotemporal model to capture features of day-ahead wind power forecasts. We work with hourly-scale day-ahead forecasts across hundreds of wind farm locations, with the main aim of constructing a fully probabilistic joint model across space and hours of the day. To this end, we design a separable space-time kernel, implementing both temporal and spatial input warping to capture the non-stationarity in the covariance of wind power. We conduct synthetic experiments to validate our choice of the spatial kernel and to demonstrate the effectiveness of warping in addressing nonstationarity. The second half of the paper is devoted to a detailed case study using a realistic, fully calibrated dataset representing wind farms in the ERCOT region of Texas.</description>

      <title>Willems' Fundamental Lemma for Nonlinear Systems with Koopman Linear Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory and Willems' fundamental lemma both can provide (approximated) data-driven linear representation for nonlinear systems. However, choosing lifting functions for the Koopman operator is challenging, and the quality of the data-driven model from Willems' fundamental lemma has no guarantee for general nonlinear systems. In this paper, we extend Willems' fundamental lemma for a class of nonlinear systems that admit a Koopman linear embedding. We first characterize the relationship between the trajectory space of a nonlinear system and that of its Koopman linear embedding. We then prove that the trajectory space of Koopman linear embedding can be formed by a linear combination of rich-enough trajectories from the nonlinear system. Combining these two results leads to a data-driven representation of the nonlinear system, which bypasses the need for the lifting functions and thus eliminates the associated bias errors. Our results illustrate that both the width (more trajectories) and depth (longer trajectories) of the trajectory library are important to ensure the accuracy of the data-driven model.</description>

      <title>MBC: Multi-Brain Collaborative Control for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of locomotion task of quadruped robots, Blind Policy and Perceptive Policy each have their own advantages and limitations. The Blind Policy relies on preset sensor information and algorithms, suitable for known and structured environments, but it lacks adaptability in complex or unknown environments. The Perceptive Policy uses visual sensors to obtain detailed environmental information, allowing it to adapt to complex terrains, but its effectiveness is limited under occluded conditions, especially when perception fails. Unlike the Blind Policy, the Perceptive Policy is not as robust under these conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a MBC:Multi-Brain collaborative system that incorporates the concepts of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and introduces collaboration between the Blind Policy and the Perceptive Policy. By applying this multi-policy collaborative model to a quadruped robot, the robot can maintain stable locomotion even when the perceptual system is impaired or observational data is incomplete. Our simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that this system significantly improves the robot's passability and robustness against perception failures in complex environments, validating the effectiveness of multi-policy collaboration in enhancing robotic motion performance.</description>

      <title>Interaction Techniques for User-friendly Interfaces for Gate-based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer promising approaches to various fields. To use current noisy quantum computers, developers need to examine the compilation of a logical circuit, the status of available hardware, and noises in results. As those tasks are less common in classical computing, quantum developers may not be familiar with performing them. Therefore, easier and more intuitive interfaces are necessary to make quantum computers more approachable. While existing notebook-based toolkits like Qiskit offer application programming interfaces and visualization techniques, it is still difficult to navigate the vast space of quantum program design and hardware status.
  Inspired by human-computer interaction (HCI) work in data science and visualization, our work introduces four user interaction techniques that can augment existing notebook-based toolkits for gate-based quantum computing: (1) a circuit writer that lets users provide high-level information about a circuit and generates a code snippet to build it; (2) a machine explorer that provides detailed properties and configurations of a hardware with a code to load selected information; (3) a circuit viewer that allows for comparing logical circuit, compiled circuit, and hardware configurations; and (4) a visualization for adjusting measurement outcomes with hardware error rates.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Dynamics from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed dynamical system with linear state transitions and bilinear observations. Under very mild assumptions on the process and measurement noises, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the unknown dynamics matrices (up to a similarity transform). Our analysis involves a regression problem with heavy-tailed and dependent data. Moreover, each row of our design matrix contains a Kronecker product of current input with a history of inputs, making it difficult to guarantee persistence of excitation. We overcome these challenges, first providing a data-dependent high probability error bound for arbitrary but fixed inputs. Then, we derive a data-independent error bound for inputs chosen according to a simple random design. Our main results provide an upper bound on the statistical error rates and sample complexity of learning the unknown dynamics matrices from a single finite trajectory of bilinear observations.</description>

      <title>Device for detection of activity-dependent changes in neural spheroids at MHz and GHz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular processes triggered by neural activity include changes in ionic concentrations, protein release, and synaptic vesicle cycling. These processes play significant roles in neurological disorders. The beneficial effects of brain stimulation may also be mediated through intracellular changes. There is a lack of label-free techniques for monitoring activity-dependent intracellular changes. Electromagnetic (EM) waves at frequencies larger than 1x10^6 Hz (1 MHz) were previously used to probe intracellular contents of cells, as cell membrane becomes transparent at this frequency range. EM waves interact with membranes of intracellular organelles, proteins, and water in the MHz-GHz range. In this work, we developed a device for probing the interaction between intracellular contents of active neurons and EM waves. The device used an array of grounded coplanar waveguides (GCPWs) to deliver EM waves to a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid of rat cortical neurons. Neural activity was evoked using optogenetics, with synchronous detection of propagation of EM waves. Broadband measurements were conducted in the MHz-GHz range to track changes in transmission coefficients. Neuronal activity was found to reversibly alter EM wave transmission. Pharmacological suppression of neuronal activity abolished changes in transmission. Time constants of changes in transmission were in the range of seconds to tens of seconds, suggesting the presence of relatively slow, activity-dependent intracellular processes. This study provides the first evidence that EM transmission through neuronal tissue is activity-dependent in MHz-GHz range. Device developed in this work may find future applications in studies of the mechanisms of neurological disorders and the development of new therapies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive method for uncertain time-varying (TV) convex optimization, termed as $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive optimization ($\mathcal{L}_{1}$-AO). The proposed method uses a baseline TV optimizer with a prediction model, designed for the gradient dynamics to exploit the underlying structure of the temporal correlation. Inspired by $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive control, the proposed method augments an adaptive update law to estimate and compensate for the uncertainty from the inaccurate prediction in the online implementation. The proposed method provides the performance bounds of the error in the optimization variables and cost function, allowing efficient and reliable optimization for uncertain TV problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile smartphones compactly provide sensors such as cameras, IMUs, GNSS measurement units, and wireless and wired communication channels required for robotics projects. They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16663v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a Visual Servoing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for autonomously tracking a moving target using multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The scheme is developed for surveillance and tracking of contour-based areas with evolving features. NMPC is used to manage input and state constraints, while additional barrier functions are incorporated in order to ensure system safety and optimal performance. The proposed control scheme is designed based on the extraction and implementation of the full dynamic model of the features describing the target and the state variables. Real-time simulations and experiments using a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Failure Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty that takes into account the failure probability of a task. This problem cannot be handled by the stochastic shortest path problem, which is the standard model for sequential decision-making. This problem is addressed by introducing dead-ends. Conventionally, we only consider policies that minimize the probability of task failure, so the optimal policy constructed could be overly conservative. In this paper, we address this issue by expanding the search range to a class of policies whose failure probability is less than a desired threshold. This problem can be solved by treating it as a framework of a Bayesian Markov decision process and a two-person zero-sum game. Also, it can be seen that the optimal policy is expressed in the form of a probability distribution on a set of deterministic policies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by applying them to a motion planning problem with obstacle avoidance for a moving robot.</description>

      <title>Distributed Robust Optimization Method for AC/MTDC Hybrid Power Systems with DC Network Cognizance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AC/multi-terminal DC (MTDC) hybrid power systems have emerged as a solution for the large-scale and longdistance accommodation of power produced by renewable energy systems (RESs). To ensure the optimal operation of such hybrid power systems, this paper addresses three key issues: system operational flexibility, centralized communication limitations, and RES uncertainties. Accordingly, a specific AC/DC optimal power flow (OPF) model and a distributed robust optimization method are proposed. Firstly, we apply a set of linear approximation and convex relaxation techniques to formulate the mixed-integer convex AC/DC OPF model. This model incorporates the DC network-cognizant constraint and enables DC topology reconfiguration. Next, generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) is employed to provide distributed optimization. Enhanced approaches are incorporated into GBD to achieve parallel computation and asynchronous updating. Additionally, the extreme scenario method (ESM) is embedded into the AC/DC OPF model to provide robust decisions to hedge against RES uncertainties. ESM is further extended to align the GBD procedure. Numerical results are finally presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inline Photometrically Calibrated Hybrid Visual SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated approach to Visual SLAM, merging online sequential photometric calibration within a Hybrid direct-indirect visual SLAM (H-SLAM). Photometric calibration helps normalize pixel intensity values under different lighting conditions, and thereby improves the direct component of our H-SLAM. A tangential benefit also results to the indirect component of H-SLAM given that the detected features are more stable across variable lighting conditions. Our proposed photometrically calibrated H-SLAM is tested on several datasets, including the TUM monoVO as well as on a dataset we created. Calibrated H-SLAM outperforms other state of the art direct, indirect, and hybrid Visual SLAM systems in all the experiments. Furthermore, in online SLAM tested at our site, it also significantly outperformed the other SLAM Systems.</description>

      <title>Towards human-like kinematics in industrial robotic arms: a case study on a UR3 robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety in industrial robotic environments is a hot research topic in the area of human-robot interaction (HRI). Up to now, a robotic arm on an assembly line interacts with other machines away from human workers. Nowadays, robotic arm manufactures are aimed to their robots could increasingly perform tasks collaborating with humans. One of the ways to improve this collaboration is by making the movement of robots more humanlike. This way, it would be easier for a human to foresee the movement of the robot and approach it without fear of contact. The main difference between the movement of a human and of a robotic arm is that the former has a bell-shaped speed profile while the latter has a uniform speed one. To generate this speed profile, the kinematic theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model has been used. This model is widely used to explain most of the basic phenomena related to the control of human movements. Both human-like and robotic-like movements are transferred to the UR3 robot. In this paper we detail the how the UR3 robot was programmed to produce both kinds of movement. The dissimilarities result between the input motion and output motion to the robot confirm the possibility to develop human-like velocities in the UR3 robot.</description>

      <title>Proactive Emergency Collision Avoidance for Automated Driving in Highway Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty in the behavior of other traffic participants is a crucial factor in collision avoidance for automated driving; here, stochastic metrics could avoid overly conservative decisions. This paper introduces a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) planner for emergency collision avoidance in highway scenarios to proactively minimize collision risk while ensuring safety through chance constraints. To guarantee that the emergency trajectory can be attained, we incorporate nonlinear tire dynamics in the prediction model of the ego vehicle. Further, we exploit Max-Min-Plus-Scaling (MMPS) approximations of the nonlinearities to avoid conservatism, enforce proactive collision avoidance, and improve computational efficiency in terms of performance and speed. Consequently, our contributions include integrating a dynamic ego vehicle model into the SMPC planner, introducing the MMPS approximation for real-time implementation in emergency scenarios, and integrating SMPC with hybridized chance constraints and risk minimization. We evaluate our SMPC formulation in terms of proactivity and efficiency in various hazardous scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing it with a state-of-the-art SMPC planner and we validate that the generated trajectories can be attained using a high-fidelity vehicle model in IPG CarMaker.</description>

      <title>SIMBa: System Identification Methods leveraging Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript details and extends the SIMBa toolbox (System Identification Methods leveraging Backpropagation) presented in previous work, which uses well-established Machine Learning tools for discrete-time linear multi-step-ahead state-space System Identification (SI). SIMBa leverages linear-matrix-inequality-based free parametrizations of Schur matrices to guarantee the stability of the identified model by design. In this paper, backed up by novel free parametrizations of Schur matrices, we extend the toolbox to show how SIMBa can incorporate known sparsity patterns or true values of the state-space matrices to identify without jeopardizing stability.
  We extensively investigate SIMBa's behavior when identifying diverse systems with various properties from both simulated and real-world data. Overall, we find it consistently outperforms traditional stable subspace identification methods, and sometimes significantly, especially when enforcing desired model properties. These results hint at the potential of SIMBa to pave the way for generic structured nonlinear SI. The toolbox is open-sourced on https://github.com/Cemempamoi/simba.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control with Equivalence to Stochastic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven receding-horizon control method dealing with the chance-constrained output-tracking problem of unknown stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with partial state observation. The proposed method takes into account the statistics of the process noise, the measurement noise and the uncertain initial condition, following an analogous framework to Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC), but does not rely on the use of a parametric system model. As such, our receding-horizon algorithm produces a sequence of closed-loop control policies for predicted time steps, as opposed to a sequence of open-loop control actions. Under certain conditions, we establish that our proposed data-driven control method produces identical control inputs as that produced by the associated model-based SMPC. Simulation results on a grid-connected power converter are provided to illustrate the performance benefits of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Identification of Additive Continuous-time Systems in Open and Closed loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When identifying electrical, mechanical, or biological systems, parametric continuous-time identification methods can lead to interpretable and parsimonious models when the model structure aligns with the physical properties of the system. Traditional linear system identification may not consider the most parsimonious model when relying solely on unfactored transfer functions, which typically result from standard direct approaches. This paper presents a novel identification method that delivers additive models for both open and closed-loop setups. The estimators that are derived are shown to be generically consistent, and can admit the identification of marginally stable additive systems. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed approach, and its performance in identifying a modal representation of a flexible beam is verified using experimental data.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Stochastic Data-driven Predictive Control under Data Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic constrained output-feedback data-driven predictive control scheme for linear time-invariant systems subject to bounded additive disturbances. The approach uses data-driven predictors based on an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma and requires only a single persistently exciting input-output data trajectory. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on availability of exact disturbance data. Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated DCOPF using Gradient-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is a key operational tool for power system operators, and it is embedded as a subproblem in many challenging optimization problems (e.g., line switching). However, traditional CPU-based solve routines (e.g., simplex) have saturated in speed and are hard to parallelize. This paper focuses on solving DCOPF problems using gradient-based routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have massive parallelization capability. To formulate these problems, we pose a Lagrange dual associated with DCOPF (linear and quadratic cost curves), and then we explicitly solve the inner (primal) minimization problem with a dual norm. The resulting dual problem can be efficiently iterated using projected gradient ascent. After solving the dual problem on both CPUs and GPUs to find tight lower bounds, we benchmark against Gurobi and MOSEK, comparing convergence speed and tightness on the IEEE 2000, 4601, and 10000 bus systems. We provide reliable and tight lower bounds for these problems with, at best, 5.4x speedup over a conventional solver.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Generic Robust Control for Servo-Driven Actuation Mechanisms with Layered Insight into Energy Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance theoretical solutions and address limitations in modeling complex servo-driven actuation systems experiencing high non-linearity and load disturbances, this paper aims to design a practical model-free generic robust control (GRC) framework for these mechanisms. This framework is intended to be applicable across all actuator systems encompassing electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic servomechanisms, while also functioning within complex interactions among dynamic components and adhering to control input constraints. In this respect, the state-space model of actuator systems is decomposed into smaller subsystems that incorporate the first principle equation of actuator motion dynamics and interactive energy conversion equations. This decomposition operates under the assumption that the comprehensive model of the servo-driven actuator system and energy conversion, uncertainties, load disturbances, and their bounds are unknown. Then, the GRC employs subsystem-based adaptive control strategies for each state-variant subsystem separately. Despite control input constraints and the unknown interactive system model, the GRC-applied actuator mechanism ensures uniform exponential stability and robustness in tracking desired motions. It features straightforward implementation, experimentally evaluated by applying it to two industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: The paper discusses the relationships between electrical and affine differential geometry quantities, establishing a link between frequency and time derivatives of voltage, through the utilization of affine geometric invariants. Based on this link, a new instantaneous frequency estimation formula is proposed, which is particularly suited for unbalanced and single-phase systems. Several examples as well as measurements based on two real-world events illustrate the findings of the paper.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Supply Chains: Definition, Characteristics, Conceptual Framework, and Autonomy Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent global disruptions, such as the pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, have profoundly exposed vulnerabilities in traditional supply chains, requiring exploration of more resilient alternatives. Autonomous supply chains (ASCs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering increased visibility, flexibility, and resilience in turbulent trade environments. Despite discussions in industry and academia over several years, ASCs lack well-established theoretical foundations. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a formal definition of ASC along with its defining characteristics and auxiliary concepts. We propose a layered conceptual framework called the MIISI model. An illustrative case study focusing on the meat supply chain demonstrates an initial ASC implementation based on this conceptual model. Additionally, we introduce a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model, delineating a trajectory towards achieving a full supply chain autonomy. Recognising that this work represents an initial endeavour, we emphasise the need for continued exploration in this emerging domain. We anticipate that this work will stimulate further research, both theoretical and technical, and contribute to the continual evolution of ASCs.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existing authentication system has two entry points (i.e., username and password fields) to interact with the outside, but neither of them has a gatekeeper, making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. In order to ensure the authentication security, the system sets a third entry point and use an external MFA service to guard it. The crux of the problem is that the system has no internal mechanism to guard its own entry points as no identifiers can be defined for the username and password without using any personal information. To solve this problem, we open the hash algorithm of a dual-password login-authentication system to three login credentials. Therefore, the intermediate elements of the algorithm can be used to define an identifier to verify the user identity at each entry point of the system. As a result of the above setup, a triple-identity authentication is established, the key of which is that the readily available user's login name and password are randomly converted into a matrix of meaningless hash elements which are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible, and independent of personal information. So the identifiers defined using such elements can be used by the system to verify the identities of the user at all the entry points of the system, thereby ensuring the authentication security without relying on MFA services.</description>

      <title>Mamba as a motion encoder for robotic imitation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning, particularly with the integration of LLM techniques, are set to significantly improve robots' dexterity and adaptability. This paper proposes using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</description>
