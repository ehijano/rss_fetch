      <title>Lattice Light Shift Evaluations In a Dual-Ensemble Yb Optical Lattice Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In state-of-the-art optical lattice clocks, beyond-electric-dipole polarizability terms lead to a break-down of magic wavelength trapping. In this Letter, we report a novel approach to evaluate lattice light shifts, specifically addressing recent discrepancies in the atomic multipolarizability term between experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. We combine imaging and multi-ensemble techniques to evaluate lattice light shift atomic coefficients, leveraging comparisons in a dual-ensemble lattice clock to rapidly evaluate differential frequency shifts. Further, we demonstrate application of a running wave field to probe both the multipolarizability and hyperpolarizability coefficients, establishing a new technique for future lattice light shift evaluations.</description>

      <title>In-situ measurements of light diffusion in an optically dense atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method to investigate in-situ light transport within optically thick ensembles of cold atoms, exploiting the internal structure of alkaline-earth metals. A method for creating an optical excitation at the center of a large atomic cloud is demonstrated, and we observe its propagation through multiple scattering events. In conditions where the cloud size is significantly larger than the transport mean free path, a diffusive regime is identified. We measure key parameters including the diffusion coefficient, transport velocity, and transport time, finding a good agreement with diffusion models. We also demonstrate that the frequency of the photons launched inside the system can be controlled. This approach enables direct time- and space-resolved observation of light diffusion in atomic ensembles, offering a promising avenue for exploring new diffusion regimes.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Topological Hall Effect in Fe-doped Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) has attracted great attention since it provides an important probe of the interaction between electron and topological spin textures. THE has been considered an experimental signature of the topological spin texture of skyrmions. While THE has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of monolayer structures is lacking, hindering the understanding of noncollinear spin textures at the atomically thin scale. Here, we show a discernible THE via proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe2 (Fe:WSe2) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe2 displaying two additional dip/peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements, consistent with the contribution of THE. The topological Hall effect is attributed to the magnetic skyrmions that emerge from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions at the Fe:WSe2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic skyrmions and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>On the effect of "glancing" collisions in the cold atom vacuum standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effect of ``glancing" collisions on the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) pressure readings of the cold atom vacuum standard (CAVS), based on either ultracold $^7$Li or $^{87}$Rb atoms. Here, glancing collisions are those collisions between ultracold atoms and room-temperature background atoms or molecules in the vacuum that do not impart enough kinetic energy to eject an ultracold atom from its trap. Our model is wholly probabilistic and shows that the number of the ultracold atoms remaining in the trap as a function of time is non-exponential. We update the recent results of a comparison between a traditional pressure standard -- a combined flowmeter and dynamic expansion system -- to the CAVS [D.S. Barker, et al., arXiv:2302.12143] to reflect the results of our model. We find that the effect of glancing collisions shifts the theoretical predictions of the total loss rate coefficients for $^7$Li colliding with noble gases or N$_2$ by up to $0.6$ %. Likewise, we find that in the limit of zero trap depth the experimentally extracted loss rate coefficients for $^{87}$Rb colliding with noble gases or N$_2$ shift by as much as 2.2 %.</description>

      <title>Direct experimental observation of sub-poissonian photon statistics by means of multi-photon scattering on a two-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cascade of two-level superconducting artificial atoms -- a source and a probe -- strongly coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide is a promising tool for observing nontrivial phenomena in quantum nonlinear optics. The probe atom can scatter an antibunched radiation emitted from the source, thereby generating a field with specific properties. We experimentally demonstrate wave mixing between nonclassical light from the coherently cw-pumped source and another coherent wave acting on the probe. We observe unique features in the wave mixing stationary spectrum which differs from mixing spectrum of two classical waves on the probe. These features are well described by adapting the theory for a strongly coupled cascaded system of two atoms. We further analyze the theory to predict non-classical mixing spectra for various ratios of atoms' radiative constants. Both experimental and numerical results confirm the domination of multi-photon scattering process with only a single photon from the source. We evaluate entanglement of atoms in the quasistationary state and illustrate the connection between the expected second-order correlation function of source's field and wave mixing side peaks corresponding to a certain number of scattered photons.</description>

      <title>Wave Steepening and Shock Formation in Ultracold Neutral Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of wave steepening and signatures of shock formation during expansion of ultracold neutral plasmas formed with an initial density distribution that is centrally peaked and decays exponentially with distance. The plasma acceleration and velocity decrease at large distance from the plasma center, leading to central ions overtaking ions in the outer regions and the development of a steepening front that is narrow compared to the size of the plasma. The density and velocity change dramatically across the front, and significant heating of the ions is observed in the region of steepest gradients. For a reasonable estimate of electron temperature, the relative velocity of ions on either side of the front modestly exceeds the local sound speed (Mach number $M \gtrsim 1$). This indicates that by sculpting steep density gradients, it is possible to create the conditions for shock formation, or very close to it, opening a new avenue of research for ultracold neutral plasmas.</description>
