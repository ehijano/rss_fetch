      <title>Four dimensional Riemannian general relativity as a spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper $4$ dimensional Riemannian (or Euclidean) vacuum general relativity is recovered from a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking within a quantum field theory (all in the sense of the algebraic approach) provided by the unique ${\rm II}_1$ hyperfinite factor von Neumann algebra. The formal temperature of this phase transition is $T=\frac{1}{2}T_{\rm Planck}\approx7.06\times 10^{31}{\rm K}$.</description>

      <title>Coupled Stochastic-Statistical Equations for Filtering Multiscale Turbulent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new strategy for filtering high-dimensional multiscale systems characterized by high-order non-Gaussian statistics using observations from leading-order moments. A closed stochastic-statistical modeling framework suitable for systematic theoretical analysis and efficient numerical simulations is designed. Optimal filtering solutions are derived based on the explicit coupling structures of stochastic and statistical equations subject to linear operators, which satisfy an infinite-dimensional Kalman-Bucy filter with conditional Gaussian dynamics. To facilitate practical implementation, we develop a finite-dimensional stochastic filter model that approximates the optimal filter solution. We prove that this approximating filter effectively captures key non-Gaussian features, demonstrating consistent statistics with the optimal filter first in its analysis step update, then at the long-time limit guaranteeing stable convergence to the optimal filter. Finally, we build a practical ensemble filter algorithm based on the approximating filtering model, which enables accurate recovery of the true model statistics. The proposed modeling and filtering strategies are applicable to a wide range challenging problems in science and engineering, particularly for statistical prediction and uncertainty quantification of multiscale turbulent states.</description>

      <title>Surface waves in randomly perturbed discrete models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of surface waves across structured surfaces with random, localized inhomogeneities. A discrete analogue of Gurtin-Murdoch model is employed and surface elasticity, in contrast to bulk elasticity, is captured by distinct point masses and elastic constants for nearest-neighbour interactions parallel to the surface. Expressions for the surface wave reflectance and transmittance, as well as the radiative loss, are provided for every localized patch of point mass perturbation on the surface. As the main result in the article, we provide the statistics of surface wave reflectance and transmittance and the radiative loss for an ensemble of random mass perturbations, independent and identically distributed with mean zero, on the surface. In the weakly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to be proportional to the size of the perturbed patch, to the variance of the mass perturbations, and to an effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed system. In the strongly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to depend on another effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum, but not on the variance of the mass perturbations. Numerical simulations are found in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for several illustrative values of the surface structure parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some idea, which leads to a non-trivial solution of the quantum four-simplex equation, is exposed in this paper. We call this idea "pentagonal algebra". Few examples of the realisation of this idea are given here, and thus few examples of $R$-matrix for the quantum four-simplex equation are presented.</description>

      <title>Kac-Ward solution of the 2D classical and 1D quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a rigorous derivation of the free energy of (i) the classical Ising model on the triangular lattice with translation-invariant coupling constants, and (ii) the one-dimensional quantum Ising model. We use the method of Kac and Ward. The novel aspect is that the coupling constants may have negative signs. We describe the logarithmic singularity of the specific heat of the classical model and the validity of the Cimasoni--Duminil-Copin-Li formula for the critical temperature. We also discuss the quantum phase transition of the quantum model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operators with potentials whose values are read along the orbits of a shift of finite type. We study a certain subset of the collection of energies at which the Lyapunov exponent is zero and prove monotonicity of this set with respect to the shift embeddings. Then we introduce a certain function ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ determined by the position of these zeros and prove monotonicity of ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ with respect to embeddings.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kind is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Global realisation of magnetic fields as 1$\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reviews the notion of $n+\frac{1}{2}$D non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, portraying their dynamics as the flow of the Reeb field related to a closed two-form of maximal rank on a cosymplectic manifold, and naturally decomposing into time-like and Hamiltonian components. The paper then investigates the conditions under which the field-line dynamics of a (tangential) divergence-free vector field on a connected compact three-manifold (possibly with boundary) diffeomorphic to a trivial fibre bundle over the circle can be conversely identified as a non-autonomous $1\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian system. Under the assumption that the field is transverse to a global compact Poincar\'e section, an adaptation of Moser's trick shows that all such fields are locally-Hamiltonian. A full identification is established upon further assuming that the Poincar\'e sections are planar, which crucially implies (together with Dirichlet boundary conditions) that the cohomology class of the generating closed one-forms on each section is constant. By reviewing the classification of fibre bundles over the circle using the monodromy representation, it is remarked that as soon as the Poincar\'e section of an alleged field is diffeomorphic to a disk or an annulus, the domain is necessarily diffeomorphic to a solid or hollow torus, and thus its field-line dynamics can always be identified as a non-autonomous Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>Proof of Zamolodchikov conjecture for semi-classical conformal blocks on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986, Zamolodchikov conjectured an exponential structure for the semi-classical limit of conformal blocks on a sphere. This paper provides a rigorous proof of the analog of Zamolodchikov conjecture for Liouville conformal blocks on a one-punctured torus, using their probabilistic construction and show the existence of a positive radius of convergence of the semi-classical limit. As a consequence, we obtain a closed form expression for the solution of the Lam\'e equation, and show a relation between its accessory parameter and the classical action of the non-autonomous elliptic Calogero-Moser model evaluated at specific values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum states as countable convex combination of pure states with bounded energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give response to the question: in infinite dimension states,given a state with energy bounded by E, we can write the state as a countable convex combination of pure states with energy bounded by E. We review the Alicki-Fannes-Winter technique to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in states that are a mix of pure states with bounded energy, using this bound we conclude that for a Hamiltonian satisfying the Gibb's hypothesis such states cannot exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the pressure of a dilute fully spin-polarized Fermi gas capturing the leading correction to the pressure of a free gas resulting from repulsive interactions. This correction is of order $a^3\rho^{8/3}$, with $a$ the $p$-wave scattering length of the interaction and $\rho$ the particle density, depends on the temperature and matches the corresponding lower bound of [arXiv:2307.01113].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the spin-2 field perturbations of four families of supergravity solutions. These include AdS$_5$ and AdS$_7$ backgrounds of type IIA as well as AdS$_4$ and AdS$_6$ backgrounds of Type IIB. As the main result, we show that, in all the cases, there is a solution given by a combination of the warp factors. We also find the respective mass spectra. We analyze the normalizability of the solutions and identify the superconformal multiplets dual to them.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of ocean surface wave turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper continues to study the long-standing problem of quasi 1-D (one dimensional) spectrum of sea surface wave turbulence. The study is based on Hasselmann's kinetic equation, which significantly simplifies for the quasi 1-D turbulence. The goal of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental observations. The paper starts with new derivation of the quasi 1-D approximation of Hasselmann's equation. The present work does not support the imposition of boundary conditions. Instead, the family of theoretical spectra is compared with P-M (Pierson-Moskowitz) and JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectra. First, a simple solution (first approximation) of the quasi 1-D equation is obtained and compared with the P-M spectrum. Then self-similar solutions are considered; they are shown to satisfy the second order ordinary differential equation. The solutions of this equation have many features of the JONSWAP spectra.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian formulations of the Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Hankel determinants of Bessel functions, which seems to be new. Hankel determinants can be rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods.</description>

      <title>Curie--Weiss Model under $\ell^{p}$ constraint and a Generalized Hubbard--Stratonovich Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising Curie--Weiss model on the complete graph constrained under a given $\ell_{p}$ norm for some $p&gt;0$. For $p=\infty$, it reduces to the classical Ising Curie--Weiss model. We prove that for all $p&gt;2$, there exists $\beta_{c}(p):=\frac{3}{p^{2/p}}\cdot\tfrac{\Gamma(1+1/p)}{\Gamma(1+3/p)}$ such that for $\beta&lt;\beta_{c}(p)$, the magnetization is concentrated at zero and satisfies an appropriate Gaussian CLT; whereas for $\beta&gt;\beta_{c}(p)$ the magnetization is not concentrated at zero similar to the classical case. Though $\beta_{c}(2)=1$, we have $\beta_{c}(p)&gt;1$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\lim_{p\to\infty}\beta_{c}(p)=3$. We further generalize the model for general symmetric spin distributions and prove a similar phase transition. For $0&lt;p&lt;1$, the log-partition function scales at the order of $n^{2/p-1}$. The proofs are mainly based on the generalized Hubbard--Stratonovich (GHS) transform, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion irrespectively of the type of metric. The general solutions of evolution equations in the spatially flat FLRW metric have been found for models the quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Structured quantitative almost reducibility and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish \textit{structured quantitative almost reducibility}, tailored for analytic quasiperiodic $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles, which effectively addresses the challenge of infinitely many \textit{normal frequency} resonances. This method paves the way for optimal arithmetic reducibility results for such cocycles, thereby resolving Jitomirskaya's conjecture. From a spectral perspective, it leads to optimal arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic long-range operators on higher-dimensional lattices. In particular, using structured quantitative almost reducibility, we establish a sharp quantitative version of Aubry duality, enabling us to uncover new spectral insights for almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequencies. For example, we precisely determine the exponential decay rate of spectral gaps in non-critical cases, thus addressing a question raised by Goldstein. Additionally, we reveal the optimal asymptotic growth of extended eigenfunctions for subcritical almost Mathieu operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is considered in the context of Generalized Electrodynamics (GE) by Podolsky and Bopp. GE is the only extension to Maxwell electrodynamics that is locally {\normalsize{}U(1)}-gauge invariant, admits linear field equations and contains higher-order derivatives of the vector potential. GE admits both massless and massive modes for the photon. We recover the ordinary quantum phase shift of the AB effect, derived in the context of Maxwell electrodynamics, for the massless mode of the photon in GE. The massive mode induces a correction factor to the AB phase shift depending on the photon mass. We study both the magnetic AB effect and its electric counterpart. In principle, accurate experimental observations of AB the phase shift could be used to constrain GE photon mass.</description>

      <title>Physically Accessible and Inaccessible Quantum Correlations of Dirac Fields in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of Hawking decoherence on the quantum correlations of Dirac fields between \textit{Alice} and \textit{Bob}. Initially, they share a \textit{Gisin} state near the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) in an asymptotically flat region. Then, \textit{Alice} remains stationary in this region, while \textit{Bob} hovers near the event horizon (EH) of the SBH. We expect that \textit{Bob}, using his excited detector, will detect a thermal Fermi-Dirac particle distribution. We assess the quantum correlations in the evolved \textit{Gisin} state using quantum consonance and uncertainty-induced non-locality across physically accessible, physically inaccessible, and spacetime regions. Our investigation examines how these measures vary with Hawking temperature, Dirac particle frequency, and the parameters of the initial \textit{Gisin} state. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of these quantum correlation measures across all possible regions, noting a redistribution towards the physically inaccessible region. Our findings demonstrate that Hawking decoherence reduces the quantum correlations of Dirac fields in the physically accessible region, with the extent of reduction depending on the initial state parameters. Moreover, as Hawking decoherence intensifies in the physically inaccessible and spacetime regions, the quantum correlations of Dirac fields reemerge and ultimately converge to specific values at infinite Hawking temperature. These results contribute to our understanding of quantum correlation dynamics within the framework of relativistic quantum information (RQI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vladimirov defined an operator on balls in $\mathbb Q_p$, the $p$-adic numbers, that is analogous to the Laplace operator in the real setting. Kochubei later provided a probabilistic interpretation of the operator. This Vladimirov-Kochubei operator generates a real-time diffusion process in the ring of $p$-adic integers, a Brownian motion in $\mathbb Z_p$. The current work shows that this process is a limit of discrete time random walks. It motivates the construction of the Vladimirov-Kochubei operator, provides further intuition about the properties of ultrametric diffusion, and gives an example of the weak convergence of stochastic processes in a profinite group.</description>

      <title>An example of a small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be globally approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are globally approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along specific transport flows, namely, space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain global approximate controllability in small times.</description>

      <title>Uniform resolvent and orthonormal Strichartz estimates for repulsive Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the uniform resolvent and orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator. First we prove the Keel-Tao type theorem for the orthonormal Strichartz estimates, which means that the dispersive estimates yield the orthonormal Strichartz estimates for strongly continuous unitary groups. This result applies to many Schr\"odinger propagators which are difficult to treat by the smooth perturbation theory, for example, local-in-time estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator with unbounded electromagnetic potentials, the $(k, a)$-generalized Laguerre operators and global-in-time estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator with scaling critical magnetic potentials including the Aharonov-Bohm potentials. Next we observe mapping properties of resolvents for the repulsive Hamiltonian and apply to the orthonormal Strichartz estimates. We prove the Kato-Yajima type uniform resolvent estimates with logarithmic decaying weight functions. This is new even when without perturbations. The proof is dependent on the microlocal analysis and the Mourre theory. We also discuss mapping properties on the Schwartz class and the Lebesgue space.</description>

Abstract: The problem of integrability is studied for a 3D generalized Hunter-Saxton equation introduced recently by O.I. Morozov. A transformation is found which brings the equation into a constant-characteristic form and simultaneously trivializes the equation's Lax representation.

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Mabuchi rays, test configurations and quantization for toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler structures on symplectic toric manifolds which are associated to toric test configurations and that are generated by convex functions on themoment polytope, $P$, whose second derivative has support given by a compact subset $K&lt;P$. Associated to the test configuration there is a polyhedral decomposition of $P$ whose components are approximated by the components of $P \setminus K$. Along such Mabuchi rays, the toric complex structure remains unchanged on the inverse image under the moment map of $(P \setminus \check {K})$, where $\check {K}$ denotes the interior of $K$. At infinite geodesic time, the K\"ahler polarizations along the ray converge to interesting new toric mixed polarizations. The quantization in these limit polarizations is given by restrictions of the monomial holomorphic sections of the K\"ahler quantization, for monomials corresponding to integral points in $P \setminus \check {K}$, and by sections on the fibers of the moment map over the integral points contained in $\check {K}$, which, along the directions parallel to $K$ are holomorphic and which along the directions transverse to $K$ are distributional. These quantizations correspond to quantizations of the central fiber of the test family, in the symplectic picture. We present the case of $S2$ in detail and then generalize to higher dimensional symplectic toric manifolds. Metrically, at infinite Mabuchi geodesic time, the sphere decomposes into two discs and a collection of cylinders, separated by infinitely long lines. Correspondingly, the quantization in the limit polarization decomposes into a direct sum of the contributions from the quantizations of each of these components.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by string theory activities, we investigate inflationary models and the swampland criteria in the context of a stringy rescaled gravity.
  Inspired by differential equations associated with special functions, we develop an algorithm to derive new scalar potential functions with hypergeometric behaviors from string theory correction terms. Among others, we obtain a family of models indexed by a couple $(m,n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers constrained by hypergeometric behaviors and certain physical requirements. Using the falsification scenario, we confront the derived models with the Planck observational data for such a stringy rescaled gravity. Then, we approach the associated swampland conjectures. For certain models of phenomenological interest, we find that the swampland criteria are satisfied for small values of the slow-roll parameters in such a modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed in the physics literature as models related to random dendritic growth in off-critical systems (and even for diffusion-limited aggregation), and in mathematics as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra (towards Brennan's conjecture and related problems in classical function theory). These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties and possibly complicated multifractal phenomena, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

Abstract: It is known that there is a correspondence between representations of superalgebras and ordinary (non-graded) algebras. Keeping in mind this type of correspondence between the twisted quantum affine superalgebra $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(2)})$ and the non-twisted quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$, we proposed, in the previous paper [arXiv:1109.5524], a Wronskian solution of the T-system for $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$ as a reduction (folding) of the Wronskian solution for the non-twisted quantum affine superalgebra $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(1)})$. In this paper, we elaborate on this solution, and give a proof missing in [arXiv:1109.5524]. In particular, we explain its connection to the Cherednik-Bazhanov-Reshetikhin (quantum Jacobi-Trudi) type determinant solution known in [arXiv:hep-th/9506167]. We also propose Wronskian-type expressions of T-functions (eigenvalues of transfer matrices) labeled by non-rectangular Young diagrams, which are quantum affine algebra analogues of the Weyl character formula for $so(2r+1)$. We show that T-functions for spinorial representations of $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$ are related to reductions of T-functions for asymptotic typical representations of $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(1)})$.</description>

      <title>Universality in the 2d quasi-periodic Ising model and Harris-Luck irrelevance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of partial separability for classical Hamiltonian systems is proposed in the context of Haantjes geometry.
  As a general result, we show that the knowledge of a non-semisimple symplectic-Haantjes manifold for a given Hamiltonian system is sufficient to construct sets of coordinates (called Darboux-Haantjes coordinates) which allow both the partial separability of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equations and the block-diagonalization of the operators of the corresponding Haantjes algebra.
  We also introduce a novel class of Hamiltonian systems, characterized by the existence of a generalized St\"ackel matrix, which by construction are partially separable. They widely generalize the known families of partially separable Hamiltonian systems. Our systems can be described in terms of semisimple but non-maximal-rank symplectic-Haantjes manifolds.</description>

      <title>A reappraisal of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence and branched Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between n-state spin and vertex models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a correspondence among spin and vertex models with the same number of local states on the square lattice with toroidal boundary conditions. We argue that the partition functions of an arbitrary $n$-state spin model and of a certain specific $n$-state vertex model coincide for finite lattice sizes. The equivalent vertex model has $n^3$ non-null Boltzmann weights and their relationship with the edge weights of the spin model is explicitly presented. In particular, the Ising model in a magnetic field is mapped to an eight-vertex model whose weights configurations combine both even and odd number of incoming and outcoming arrows at a vertex. We have studied the Yang-Baxter algebra for such mixed eight-vertex model when the weights are invariant under arrows reversing. We find that while the Lax operator lie on the same elliptic curve of the even eight-vertex model the respective $\mathrm{R}$-matrix can not be presented in terms of the difference of two rapidities. We also argue that the spin-vertex equivalence may be used to imbed an integrable spin model in the realm of the quantum inverse scattering framework. As an example, we show how to determine the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix of the 27-vertex model equivalent to a three-state spin model devised by Fateev and Zamolodchikov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the quantum Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy defined by Buryak and Rossi. We prove that eigenvalues to first order in the dispersion parameter are given by shifted symmetric functions. The proof is based on the boson-fermion correspondence and an analysis of quartic expressions in fermions. As an application, we obtain a new closed evaluation of certain double Hodge integrals on the moduli spaces of curves. Finally, we provide an explicit formula for the eigenvectors to first order in the dispersion parameter. In particular, we show that its Schur expansion is supported on partitions for which the Hamming distance is minimal.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues display intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>First-order asymptotic perturbation theory for extensions of symmetric operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.00247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work offers a new prospective on asymptotic perturbation theory for varying self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators. Employing symplectic formulation of self-adjointness we obtain a new version of Krein formula for resolvent difference which facilitates asymptotic analysis of resolvent operators via first order expansion for the family of Lagrangian planes associated with perturbed operators. Specifically, we derive a Riccati-type differential equation and the first order asymptotic expansion for resolvents of self-adjoint extensions determined by smooth one-parameter families of Lagrangian planes. This asymptotic perturbation theory yields a symplectic version of the abstract Kato selection theorem and Hadamard-Rellich-type variational formula for slopes of multiple eigenvalue curves bifurcating from an eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator. The latter, in turn, gives a general infinitesimal version of the celebrated formula equating the spectral flow of a path of self-adjoint extensions and the Maslov index of the corresponding path of Lagrangian planes. Applications are given to quantum graphs, periodic Kronig-Penney model, elliptic second order partial differential operators with Robin boundary conditions, and physically relevant heat equations with thermal conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role of the Jacobi last multiplier in the context of two-dimensional oscillators. We first consider two-dimensional unit-mass oscillators admitting a separable Hamiltonian description, i.e., $H = H_1 + H_2$, where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the Hamiltonians of two one-dimensional unit-mass oscillators; it is shown that there exists a third functionally-independent first integral $\Theta$, thereby ensuring superintegrablility. Various examples are explicitly worked out. We then consider position-dependent-mass oscillators and the Bateman pair, where the latter consists of a pair of dissipative linear oscillators. Quite remarkably, the Bateman pair is found to be superintegrable, despite admitting a Hamiltonian which cannot be separated into those of two isolated (non-interacting) one-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of singular Gibbs measures for three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-wave system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study singular Gibbs measures for the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-wave system, also known as the Yukawa system. Our primary result is the phase transition between weak and strong coupling cases, a phenomenon absent in one- and two-dimensional cases. Therefore, the three-dimensional model turns out to be critical, exhibiting the phase transition. In the weak coupling case, the Gibbs measure can be normalized as a probability measure and is shown to be singular with respect to the Gaussian free field. Conversely, in the strong coupling case, the Gibbs measure cannot be constructed as a probability measure. In particular, the finite-dimensional truncated Gibbs measures have no weak limit in an appropriate space, even up to a subsequence.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum metrological performance and exact Heisenberg limit precision through superposition of $s$-spin coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum phase estimation, the Heisenberg limit provides the ultimate accuracy over quasi-classical estimation procedures. However, realizing this limit hinges upon both the detection strategy employed for output measurements and the characteristics of the input states. This study delves into quantum phase estimation using $s$-spin coherent states superposition. Initially, we delve into the explicit formulation of spin coherent states for a spin $s=3/2$. Both the quantum Fisher information and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound are meticulously examined. We analytically show that the ultimate measurement precision of spin cat states approaches the Heisenberg limit, where uncertainty decreases inversely with the total particle number. Moreover, we investigate the phase sensitivity introduced through operators $e^{i\zeta{S}_{z}}$, $e^{i\zeta{S}_{x}}$ and $e^{i\zeta{S}_{y}}$, subsequently comparing the resultants findings. In closing, we provide a general analytical expression for the quantum Cramer-Rao boundary applied to these three parameter-generating operators, utilizing general $s$-spin coherent states. We remarked that attaining Heisenberg-limit precision requires the careful adjustment of insightful information about the geometry of $s$-spin cat states on the Bloch sphere. Additionally, as the number of $s$-spin increases, the Heisenberg limit decreases, and this reduction is inversely proportional to the $s$-spin number.</description>

      <title>Integral invariants for framed 3-manifolds associated to trivalent graphs possibly with self-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bott--Cattaneo's theory defines the integral invariants for a framed rational homology 3-sphere equipped with an acyclic orthogonal local system, in terms of graph cocycles without self-loops. The 2-loop term of their invariants is associated with the theta graph. Their definition requires a cohomological condition. Cattaneo--Shimizu removed this cohomological condition and gave a 2-loop invariant associated with a linear combination of the theta graph and the dumbbell graph, the 2-loop trivalent graph with self-loops. In this paper, we are concerned with an acyclic local system given by the adjoint representation of a semi-simple Lie group composed with a representation of the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold, and we show that through a cohomological construction eventually the integral associated with the dumbbell graph vanishes. Based on this idea, we construct a theory of graph complexes and cocycles, so that higher-loop invariants can be defined by two different but equivalent methods: the graph cocycles without self-loops as in Bott--Cattaneo's theory, and the ones with self-loops that extend Cattaneo--Shimizu's 2-loop invariants. As a consequence, we prove that the generating series of Chern--Simons perturbation theory gives rise to topological invariants for framed 3-manifolds in our setting, which admits a formula in terms of only trivalent graphs without self-loops.</description>

      <title>A double copy from twisted (co)homology at genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the twisted (co)homology of a family of genus-one integrals -- the so called Riemann-Wirtinger integrals. These integrals are closely related to one-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting where one leaves the loop-momentum, modulus and all but one puncture un-integrated. While not actual one-loop string integrals, they share many properties and are simple enough that the associated twisted (co)homologies have been completely characterized [Goto2022,arXiv:2206.03177]. Using intersection numbers -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed differential forms -- we derive the Gauss-Manin connection for two bases of the twisted cohomology providing an independent check of [Mano&amp;Watanabe2012]. We also use the intersection index -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed contours -- to derive a double-copy formula for the closed-string analogues of Riemann-Wirtinger integrals (one-dimensional integrals over the torus). Similar to the celebrated KLT formula between open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes, these intersection indices form a genus-one KLT-like kernel defining bilinears in meromorphic Riemann-Wirtinger integrals that are equal to their complex counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that arbitrary smooth perturbations of the zero equilibrium state of the repulsive pressureless Euler-Poisson equations, which describe the behavior of cold plasma, blow up for any non-constant doping profile already in one-dimensional space. Further, we study small perturbations of the equilibrium to determine which properties of the doping profile contribute to the blow-up. We also propose a numerical procedure that allows one to find the blow-up time for any initial data and present examples of such calculations for various doping profiles for standard initial data, corresponding to the laser pulse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Strong zero modes in integrable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-frequency inverse source problem for the discrete Helmholtz operator on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 1$. We consider this problem for the cases with and without phase information. We prove uniqueness results and present examples of non-uniqueness for this problem for the case of compactly supported source function, and a Lipshitz stability estimate for the phased case is established. Relations with inverse scattering problem for the discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators in the Born approximation are also provided.</description>

      <title>A quasilinear Keller-Segel model with saturated discontinuous advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with the same mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to the one-dimensional models with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <title>On the Ground State Energies of Discrete and Semiclassical Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the infimum of the spectrum, or ground state energy (g.s.e.), of a discrete Schr\"odinger operator on $\theta\mathbb{Z}^d$ parameterized by a potential $V:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and a frequency parameter $\theta\in (0,1)$. We relate this g.s.e. to that of a corresponding continuous semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with parameter $\theta$, arising from the same choice of potential. We show that: the discrete g.s.e. is at most the continuous one for continuous periodic $V$ and irrational $\theta$; the opposite inequality holds up to a factor of $1-o(1)$ as $\theta\rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently regular smooth periodic $V$; and the opposite inequality holds up to a constant factor for every bounded $V$ and $\theta$ with the property that discrete and continuous averages of $V$ on fundamental domains of $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ are comparable. Our proofs are elementary and rely on sampling and interpolation to map low-energy functions for the discrete operator on $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ to low-energy functions for the continuous operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Displacement within velocity effect in gravitational wave memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations as close as desired to special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing global analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations not only mirror the original function as accurately as desired, but are purposefully created to possess features that the original function lacks. This is particularly useful for functions that lack closed form and are defined by integrals or infinite series. Replacing these definitions with simple analytical expressions enables in-depth qualitative analysis and replaces the current methods of evaluation. We demonstrate this procedure by providing replacements for a variety of pivotal functions in physics and cosmology including the pressure and density of quantum gas, the one-loop correction in thermal field theory, common polylog functions, and the error function.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian multiform structure of discrete and semi-discrete KP systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational structure for the potential AKP system is established using the novel formalism of a Lagrangian multiforms. The structure comprises not only the fully discrete equation on the 3D lattice, but also its semi-discrete variants including several differential-difference equations asssociated with, and compatible with, the partial difference equation. To this end, an overview is given of the various (discrete and semi-discrete) variants of the KP system, and their associated Lax representations, including a novel `generating PDE' for the KP hierarchy. The exterior derivative of the Lagrangian 3-form for the lattice potential KP equation is shown to exhibit a double-zero structure, which implies the corresponding generalised Euler-Lagrange equations. Alongside the 3-form structures, we develop a variational formulation of the corresponding Lax systems via the square eigenfunction representation arising from the relevant direct linearization scheme.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of disturbances in higher time-derivative theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of localized initial value profiles when propagated in integrable versions of higher time-derivative theories. In contrast to the standard cases in nonlinear integrable systems, where these profiles evolve into a specific number of N-soliton solutions as dictated by the conservation laws, in the higher time derivative theories the theoretical prediction is that the initial profiles can settle into either two-soliton solutions or into any number of N-soliton solutions. In the latter case this implies that the solutions exhibit oscillations that spread in time but remain finite. We confirm these analytical predictions by explicitly solving the associated Cauchy problem numerically with multiple initial profiles for various higher time-derivative versions of integrable modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In the case with the theoretical possibility of a decay into two-soliton solutions, the emergence of underlying singularities may prevent the profiles from fully developing or may be accompanied by oscillatory, chargeless standing waves at the origin.</description>

Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.</description>
