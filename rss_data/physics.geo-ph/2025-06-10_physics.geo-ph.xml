      <title>Algorithmic Analysis of GTFS-RT vehicle position accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents three novel algorithms for calculating geodesic intersections on an ellipsoid. These algorithms are applied in a case study analyzing real-time transit data in California to assess vehicle position drift. The analysis reveals that while certain data anomalies can be corrected, large-scale discrepancies persist. The paper concludes by proposing a set of practical solutions that can be implemented by either data producers or consumers to significantly improve positional accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the three laws of earthquake physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper provides a synoptic overview of a series of works carried out by a group of researchers at the Institute of Physics of the Earth RAS with the aim of finding new approaches to the problems of earthquake physics. The fundamental laws of Omori, Gutenberg-Richter and Bath have served as a constant support and reference point in the course of many years of research. The concept of the tectonic earthquake triad as a natural trinity of foreshocks, main shocks and aftershocks is used in the article to organise the thematic material. A classification of main shocks into six types of triads found in experience is given. The parameters appearing in the three laws for different types of triads are given. The axiomatic theory of the evolution of aftershocks is outlined. The concepts of source deactivation, Omori epoch and source bifurcation are introduced, and the notion of the proper time of unsteady lithospheric processes is introduced. Convergence of foreshocks and divergence of aftershocks are mentioned. The general conclusion is that the Omori, Gutenberg-Richter and Bath laws are reliable tools in the experimental and theoretical study of earthquakes. The laws have a depth of content that has been demonstrated by the ability to enrich the original formulations of the discoverers with interesting and important additional statements.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Earthquake Monitoring Using a Multitask Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic waveforms contain rich information about earthquake processes, making effective data analysis crucial for earthquake monitoring, source characterization, and seismic hazard assessment. With rapid developments in deep learning, the state-of-the-art approach in artificial intelligence, many neural network models have been developed to enhance earthquake monitoring tasks, such as earthquake detection, phase picking, and phase association. However, most current efforts focus on developing separate models for each specific task, leaving the potential of an end-to-end framework relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we extend an existing phase picking model, PhaseNet, to create a multitask framework. This extended model, PhaseNet+, simultaneously performs phase arrival-time picking, first-motion polarity determination, and phase association. The outputs from these perception-based models can then be processed by specialized physics-based algorithms to accurately determine earthquake location and focal mechanism. The multitask approach is not limited to the PhaseNet model and can be applied to other state-of-the-art phase picking models, ultimately improving seismic monitoring through a more unified and efficient approach.</description>

      <title>Electrical Conductivity of Superionic Hydrous SiO2 and the Origin of Lower-mantle High Conductivity Anomalies Beneath Subduction Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity (EC) is one of the important physical properties of minerals and rocks that can be used to characterize the composition and structure of the deep interior of the Earth.Theoretical studies have predicted that the CaCl2-type hydrous Al-bearing SiO2 phase, present in subducted crustal materials, becomes superionic-meaning that protons are no longer bonded to a specific oxygen atom but instead become mobile within the SiO2 lattice-under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions corresponding to the lower mantle. The enhancement of the EC upon such superionic transition has not been experimentally verified yet. Here, we measured the EC of Al-bearing SiO2 containing 1750 ppm H2O at pressures up to 82 GPa and temperatures up to 2610 K by employing a recently developed technique designed for measuring transparent materials. Results demonstrate a sudden increase in EC to approximately 10 S/m at temperatures of 1100-2200 K, depending on pressure, which is several to ten times higher than that of the surrounding shallow to middle part of the lower mantle, which is attributed to a transition to the superionic state. If hydrous SiO2 is substantially weaker than other coexisting phases and thus forms an interconnected film in subducted MORB crust, the EC of the bulk MORB materials is significantly enhanced by superionic SiO2 in the lower mantle up to ~1800 km depth, which may explain the high EC anomalies observed at subduction zones underneath northeastern China. The observed EC anomalies can be matched by the EC of subducted MORB materials containing Al-bearing SiO2 with a water content of approximately 0.2 wt%, providing insights into the deep H2O circulation and distribution in the Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Efficient Seismic Data Interpolation via Sparse Attention Transformer and Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data interpolation is a critical pre-processing step for improving seismic imaging quality and remains a focus of academic innovation. To address the computational inefficiencies caused by extensive iterative resampling in current plug-and-play diffusion interpolation methods, we propose the diffusion-enhanced sparse attention transformer (Diff-spaformer), a novel deep learning framework. Our model integrates transformer architectures and diffusion models via a Seismic Prior Extraction Network (SPEN), which serves as a bridge module. Full-layer sparse multi-head attention and feed-forward propagation capture global information distributions, while the diffusion model provides robust prior guidance. To mitigate the computational burden of high-dimensional representations, self-attention is computed along the channel rather than the spatial dimension. We show that using negative squared Euclidean distance to compute sparse affinity matrices better suits seismic data modeling, enabling broader contribution from amplitude feature nodes. An adaptive ReLU function further discards low or irrelevant self-attention values. We conduct training within a single-stage optimization framework, requiring only a few reverse diffusion sampling steps during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved interpolation fidelity and computational efficiency for both random and continuous missing data, offering a new paradigm for high-efficiency seismic data reconstruction under complex geological conditions.</description>

      <title>Endo-exo framework for a unifying classification of episodic landslide movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landslides exhibit intermittent gravity-driven downslope movements developing over days to years before a possible major collapse, commonly boosted by external events like precipitations and earthquakes. The reasons behind these episodic movements and how they relate to the final instability remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a novel "endo-exo" theory to quantitatively diagnose landslide dynamics, capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage/healing processes. We predict four distinct types of episodic landslide dynamics (endogenous/exogenous-subcritical/critical), characterized by power law relaxations with different exponents, all related to a single parameter \vartheta. These predictions are tested on the dataset of the Preonzo landslide, which exhibited multi-year episodic movements prior to a catastrophic collapse. All its sporadic activities can be accounted for within this classification with \vartheta \approx 0.45\pm0.1, providing strong support for our parsimonious theory. We find that the final collapse of this landslide is clearly preceded over 1-2 months by an increased frequency of medium/large velocities, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime with amplifying positive feedbacks. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, which has major implications for forecasting catastrophic failure events.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Earth's core generates large topographic torques on the mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic and geodynamic studies indicate that the boundary between the Earth's liquid outer core and solid mantle is not spherical, but is likely characterized by topography in the form of inverted mountains and valleys that have typical amplitudes of several kilometers. One of the dynamical consequences of these deformations is that turbulent flow in the core can exert pressure torques on the mantle, thereby resulting in a transfer of angular momentum between the outer core and the mantle. Understanding this transfer of angular momentum is important for explaining variations in the Earth's rotation rate, or length of day. Whether kilometer-sized topography can explain observed variations in length of day is a longstanding question in geophysics. Here we use a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of hydrodynamic convection in a rotating spherical shell with boundary topography to show that topographic torques exhibit a linear dependence on topographic amplitude and approach a quadratic dependence on flow speeds. This observation is explained with the asymptotic theory of rapidly rotating convection. These results imply that topographic torques are of sufficient magnitude to explain length of day variations.</description>

      <title>A Resonant Beginning for the Solar System Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, transit surveys have revealed a class of planets with thick atmospheres -- sub-Neptunes -- that must have completed their accretion in protoplanet disks. When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.</description>
