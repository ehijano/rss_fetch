      <title>The Unequal Costs of Pollution: Carbon Tax, Inequality, and Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how household heterogeneity affects the level and cyclical behavior of the optimal carbon tax in a real economy. We demonstrate that an equity-efficiency trade-off arises due to income inequality and heterogeneity in the marginal disutility of pollution. Two scenarios are analyzed: one with unrestricted income redistribution to mitigate inequality and another where redistribution is constrained to carbon tax revenues. Our findings reveal that household heterogeneity and redistribution policies significantly shape the level and cyclical behavior of the optimal carbon tax, decoupling it from the social cost of carbon. When the planner prioritizes redistribution towards poorer households, the optimal tax rate is lower than in the unconstrained scenario, and its fluctuations are amplified by countercyclical inequality.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Health Investment: Historical Motivations and Fertility Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this working paper, I developed a suite of macroeconomic models that shed light on the intricate relationship between economic development, health, and fertility. These innovative models conceptualize health as an intermediate good, paving the way for new interpretations of dynamic socio-economic phenomena, particularly the non-monotonic effects of health on economic and population growth. The evolving dynamic interactions among economic growth, population, and health during the early stages of human development have been well interpreted in this research.</description>

      <title>Commitment, Conflict, and Status Quo in Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each period, two players bargain over a unit of surplus. Each player chooses between remaining flexible and committing to a take-it-or-leave-it offer at a cost. If players' committed demands are incompatible, then the current-period surplus is destroyed in the conflict. When both players are flexible, the surplus is split according to the status quo, which is the division in the last period where there was no conflict. We show that when players are patient and the cost of commitment is small, there exist a class of symmetric Markov Perfect equilibria that are asymptotically efficient and renegotiation proof, in which players commit to fair demands in almost all periods.</description>

      <title>Price Impact of Health Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the equilibrium effects of insurance contracts on healthcare markets using a mechanism design framework. A population of risk-averse agents with preferences as in Yaari (1987) face the risk of developing an illness of unknown severity, which can be treated in a competitive hospital services market at the prevailing market price. After privately observing their health risk, but before learning their sickness level, agents have the option to purchase insurance from a monopolistic provider. Insurance contracts specify premiums, out-of-pocket costs (OPCs), and hospital service coverage, thus determining demand and price in the downstream hospital market through a market-clearing condition. Our first main result shows that optimal insurance contracts take a simple form: agents can choose between full hospital coverage with a high OPC or restricted coverage with a low OPC. This highlights a novel form of under-insurance (rationing or restricted access to healthcare services) emerging purely due to the insurer's attempt to control his price impact. Our second key result illustrates the nuanced effect of price impact on the amount of insurance provided. Higher healthcare prices increase insurer payouts but also worsen agents' outside options, making them more willing to pay for insurance ex ante. The net effect of these forces determines whether insurance provision exceeds or falls short of a price-taking benchmark.</description>

      <title>Path Dependence in AMM-Based Markets: Mathematical Proof and Implications for Truth Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that Automated Market Maker (AMM) based markets, such as those using constant product formulas (e.g., Uniswap), are inherently path-dependent. We prove mathematically that the sequence of operations in AMMs determines the final state, challenging the notion that market prices solely reflect information. This property has profound implications for decentralized prediction markets that rely on AMMs for price discovery, as it demonstrates they cannot function as pure "truth machines." Using both mathematical proofs and empirical evidence from ETH/USDC pools, we show that AMM-based markets incorporate historical path information beyond the current market beliefs. Our findings contribute to the understanding of market efficiency, mechanism design, and the interpretation of prices in decentralized finance systems.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Cost of Waiting for Accurate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic predictions are increasingly informing societal resource allocations by identifying individuals for targeting. Policymakers often build these systems with the assumption that by gathering more observations on individuals, they can improve predictive accuracy and, consequently, allocation efficiency. An overlooked yet consequential aspect of prediction-driven allocations is that of timing. The planner has to trade off relying on earlier and potentially noisier predictions to intervene before individuals experience undesirable outcomes, or they may wait to gather more observations to make more precise allocations. We examine this tension using a simple mathematical model, where the planner collects observations on individuals to improve predictions over time. We analyze both the ranking induced by these predictions and optimal resource allocation. We show that though individual prediction accuracy improves over time, counter-intuitively, the average ranking loss can worsen. As a result, the planner's ability to improve social welfare can decline. We identify inequality as a driving factor behind this phenomenon. Our findings provide a nuanced perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that it is preferable to wait for more accurate predictions to ensure the most efficient allocations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous elections make single-party sweeps more likely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a country with multiple elections, it may be expedient to hold some or all of them on a common polling date. Our main result, Theorem C, is that under certain assumptions, an increase in the simultaneity of polling increases the likelihood of a sweep, i.e. the likelihood that a single party wins all the elections. We discuss the applicability of our result to the two most common real world electoral systems, namely first-past-the-post (most voters, including US and India) and party list proportional representation (most countries).
  We deduce Theorem C from a certain inequality proved in Theorem D, which is of independent interest. In particular, we connect our inequality to the Harris correlation inequality, which is a multivariate generalization of the Chebyshev sum inequality, and plays an important role in statistical mechanics and graph theory. More precisely, we show that Theorem D also implies Theorem F, which extends the domain of the Harris inequality to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <title>Robust Equilibria in Generic Extensive form Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the 2-player, generic extensive-form case of the conjecture of Govindan and Wilson (1997a,b) and Hauk and Hurkens (2002) stating that an equilibrium component is essential in every equivalent game if and only if the index of the component is nonzero. This provides an index-theoretic characterization of the concept of hyperstable components of equilibria in generic extensive-form games, first formulated by Kohlberg and Mertens (1986). We also illustrate how to compute hyperstable equilibria in multiple economically relevant examples and show how the predictions of hyperstability compare with other solution concepts.</description>

      <title>Experiments in the Linear Convex Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two rankings of statistical experiments using the linear convex order. These rankings hold in a broader set of scenarios where intuition suggests that one experiment is more informative than another, and provide more tractable characterizations than Blackwell order, which relies on the convex order. We apply these rankings to compare statistical experiments in binary-action decision problems and in decision problems that aggregate payoffs over a collection of binary-action decision problems. Furthermore, these rankings enable comparisons of statistical experiments in moral hazard problems without requiring the validity of the first-order approach, thereby complementing the results in Holmstr\"om (1979) and Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>T\^atonnement in Homothetic Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prevalent theme in the economics and computation literature is to identify natural price-adjustment processes by which sellers and buyers in a market can discover equilibrium prices. An example of such a process is t\^atonnement, an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by French economist Walras in which sellers adjust prices based on the Marshallian demands of buyers. A dual concept in consumer theory is a buyer's Hicksian demand. In this paper, we identify the maximum of the absolute value of the elasticity of the Hicksian demand, as an economic parameter sufficient to capture and explain a range of convergent and non-convergent t\^atonnement behaviors in a broad class of markets. In particular, we prove the convergence of t\^atonnement at a rate of $O((1+\varepsilon^2)/T)$, in homothetic Fisher markets with bounded price elasticity of Hicksian demand, i.e., Fisher markets in which consumers have preferences represented by homogeneous utility functions and the price elasticity of their Hicksian demand is bounded, where $\varepsilon \geq 0$ is the maximum absolute value of the price elasticity of Hicksian demand across all buyers. Our result not only generalizes known convergence results for CES Fisher markets, but extends them to mixed nested CES markets and Fisher markets with continuous, possibly non-concave, homogeneous utility functions. Our convergence rate covers the full spectrum of nested CES utilities, including Leontief and linear utilities, unifying previously existing disparate convergence and non-convergence results. In particular, for $\varepsilon = 0$, i.e., Leontief markets, we recover the best-known convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, and as $\varepsilon \to \infty$, e.g., linear Fisher markets, we obtain non-convergent behavior, as expected.</description>

      <title>On the Viability of Open-Source Financial Rails: Economic Security of Permissionless Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin demonstrated the possibility of a financial ledger that operates without the need for a trusted central authority. However, concerns persist regarding its security and considerable energy consumption. We assess the consensus protocols that underpin Bitcoin's functionality, questioning whether they can ensure economically meaningful security while maintaining a permissionless design that allows free entry of operators. We answer this affirmatively by constructing a protocol that guarantees economic security and preserves Bitcoin's permissionless design. This protocol's security does not depend on monetary payments to miners or immense electricity consumption, which our analysis suggests are ineffective. Our framework integrates economic theory with distributed systems theory, and formalizes the role of the protocol's user community.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Trading: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum games, like quantum algorithms, exploit quantum entanglement to establish strong correlations between strategic player actions. This paper introduces quantum game-theoretic models applied to trading and demonstrates their implementation on an ion-trap quantum computer. The results showcase a quantum advantage, previously known only theoretically, realized as higher-paying market Nash equilibria. This advantage could help uncover alpha in trading strategies, defined as excess returns compared to established benchmarks. These findings suggest that quantum computing could significantly influence the development of financial strategies.</description>
