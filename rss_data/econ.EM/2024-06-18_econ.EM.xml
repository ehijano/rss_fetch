      <title>Model-Based Inference and Experimental Design for Interference Using Partial Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable unit treatment value assumption states that the outcome of an individual is not affected by the treatment statuses of others, however in many real world applications, treatments can have an effect on many others beyond the immediately treated. Interference can generically be thought of as mediated through some network structure. In many empirically relevant situations however, complete network data (required to adjust for these spillover effects) are too costly or logistically infeasible to collect. Partially or indirectly observed network data (e.g., subsamples, aggregated relational data (ARD), egocentric sampling, or respondent-driven sampling) reduce the logistical and financial burden of collecting network data, but the statistical properties of treatment effect adjustments from these design strategies are only beginning to be explored. In this paper, we present a framework for the estimation and inference of treatment effect adjustments using partial network data through the lens of structural causal models. We also illustrate procedures to assign treatments using only partial network data, with the goal of either minimizing estimator variance or optimally seeding. We derive single network asymptotic results applicable to a variety of choices for an underlying graph model. We validate our approach using simulated experiments on observed graphs with applications to information diffusion in India and Malawi.</description>

      <title>Standard Errors for Calibrated Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration, the practice of choosing the parameters of a structural model to match certain empirical moments, can be viewed as minimum distance estimation. Existing standard error formulas for such estimators require a consistent estimate of the correlation structure of the empirical moments, which is often unavailable in practice. Instead, the variances of the individual empirical moments are usually readily estimable. Using only these variances, we derive conservative standard errors and confidence intervals for the structural parameters that are valid even under the worst-case correlation structure. In the over-identified case, we show that the moment weighting scheme that minimizes the worst-case estimator variance amounts to a moment selection problem with a simple solution. Finally, we develop tests of over-identifying or parameter restrictions. We apply our methods empirically to a model of menu cost pricing for multi-product firms and to a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model.</description>

      <title>Inference for Nonlinear Endogenous Treatment Effects Accounting for High-Dimensional Covariate Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and endogeneity are prevalent challenges in causal analysis using observational data. This paper proposes an inference procedure for a nonlinear and endogenous marginal effect function, defined as the derivative of the nonparametric treatment function, with a primary focus on an additive model that includes high-dimensional covariates. Using the control function approach for identification, we implement a regularized nonparametric estimation to obtain an initial estimator of the model. Such an initial estimator suffers from two biases: the bias in estimating the control function and the regularization bias for the high-dimensional outcome model. Our key innovation is to devise the double bias correction procedure that corrects these two biases simultaneously. Building on this debiased estimator, we further provide a confidence band of the marginal effect function. Simulations and an empirical study of air pollution and migration demonstrate the validity of our procedures.</description>

      <title>A dual approach to nonparametric characterization for random utility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel characterization for random utility models (RUM), which turns out to be a dual representation of the characterization by Kitamura and Stoye (2018, ECMA). For a given family of budgets and its "patch" representation \'a la Kitamura and Stoye, we construct a matrix $\Xi$ of which each row vector indicates the structure of possible revealed preference relations in each subfamily of budgets. Then, it is shown that a stochastic demand system on the patches of budget lines, say $\pi$, is consistent with a RUM, if and only if $\Xi\pi \geq \mathbb{1}$, where the RHS is the vector of $1$'s. In addition to providing a concise quantifier-free characterization, especially when $\pi$ is inconsistent with RUMs, the vector $\Xi\pi$ also contains information concerning (1) sub-families of budgets in which cyclical choices must occur with positive probabilities, and (2) the maximal possible weights on rational choice patterns in a population. The notion of Chv\'atal rank of polytopes and the duality theorem in linear programming play key roles to obtain these results.</description>
