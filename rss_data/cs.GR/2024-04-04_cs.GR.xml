      <title>NeRFCodec: Neural Feature Compression Meets Neural Radiance Fields for Memory-Efficient Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has greatly impacted 3D scene modeling and novel-view synthesis. As a kind of visual media for 3D scene representation, compression with high rate-distortion performance is an eternal target. Motivated by advances in neural compression and neural field representation, we propose NeRFCodec, an end-to-end NeRF compression framework that integrates non-linear transform, quantization, and entropy coding for memory-efficient scene representation. Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical, we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically, we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads, while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss, yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters. At test time, the bitstreams containing latent code, feature decoder head, and other side information are transmitted for communication. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing NeRF compression methods, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with a memory budget of 0.5 MB.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-based Point Cloud Generation with Smoothness Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been popular for point cloud generation tasks. Existing works utilize the forward diffusion process to convert the original point distribution into a noise distribution and then learn the reverse diffusion process to recover the point distribution from the noise distribution. However, the reverse diffusion process can produce samples with non-smooth points on the surface because of the ignorance of the point cloud geometric properties. We propose alleviating the problem by incorporating the local smoothness constraint into the diffusion framework for point cloud generation. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model can generate realistic shapes and smoother point clouds, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>3DStyleGLIP: Part-Tailored Text-Guided 3D Neural Stylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D stylization, which entails the application of specific styles to three-dimensional objects, holds significant commercial potential as it enables the creation of diverse 3D objects with distinct moods and styles, tailored to specific demands of different scenes. With recent advancements in text-driven methods and artificial intelligence, the stylization process is increasingly intuitive and automated, thereby diminishing the reliance on manual labor and expertise. However, existing methods have predominantly focused on holistic stylization, thereby leaving the application of styles to individual components of a 3D object unexplored. In response, we introduce 3DStyleGLIP, a novel framework specifically designed for text-driven, part-tailored 3D stylization. Given a 3D mesh and a text prompt, 3DStyleGLIP leverages the vision-language embedding space of the Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model to localize the individual parts of the 3D mesh and modify their colors and local geometries to align them with the desired styles specified in the text prompt. 3DStyleGLIP is effectively trained for 3D stylization tasks through a part-level style loss working in GLIP's embedding space, supplemented by two complementary learning techniques. Extensive experimental validation confirms that our method achieves significant part-wise stylization capabilities, demonstrating promising potential in advancing the field of 3D stylization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Occupancy Learning from Sparse Point Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations have gained prominence as a powerful framework for capturing complex data modalities, encompassing a wide range from 3D shapes to images and audio. Within the realm of 3D shape representation, Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential in faithfully encoding intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from 3D point clouds in the absence of ground truth supervision remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method to infer occupancy fields instead of SDFs as they are easier to learn from sparse inputs. We leverage a margin-based uncertainty measure to differentially sample from the decision boundary of the occupancy function and supervise the sampled boundary points using the input point cloud. We further stabilize the optimization process at the early stages of the training by biasing the occupancy function towards minimal entropy fields while maximizing its entropy at the input point cloud. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve implicit shape inference with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>An Error-Bounded Lossy Compression Method with Bit-Adaptive Quantization for Particle Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents error-bounded lossy compression tailored for particle datasets from diverse scientific applications in cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion energy sciences. As today's high-performance computing capabilities advance, these datasets often reach trillions of points, posing significant visualization, analysis, and storage challenges. While error-bounded lossy compression makes it possible to represent floating-point values with strict pointwise accuracy guarantees, the lack of correlations in particle data's storage ordering often limits the compression ratio. Inspired by quantization-encoding schemes in SZ lossy compressors, we dynamically determine the number of bits to encode particles of the dataset to increase the compression ratio. Specifically, we utilize a k-d tree to partition particles into subregions and generate ``bit boxes'' centered at particles for each subregion to encode their positions. These bit boxes ensure error control while reducing the bit count used for compression. We comprehensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art compressors on cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion plasma datasets.</description>

      <title>MatAtlas: Text-driven Consistent Geometry Texturing and Material Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MatAtlas, a method for consistent text-guided 3D model texturing. Following recent progress we leverage a large scale text-to-image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as a prior to texture a 3D model. We carefully design an RGB texturing pipeline that leverages a grid pattern diffusion, driven by depth and edges. By proposing a multi-step texture refinement process, we significantly improve the quality and 3D consistency of the texturing output. To further address the problem of baked-in lighting, we move beyond RGB colors and pursue assigning parametric materials to the assets. Given the high-quality initial RGB texture, we propose a novel material retrieval method capitalized on Large Language Models (LLM), enabling editabiliy and relightability. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of geometries and show that our method significantly outperform prior arts. We also analyze the role of each component through a detailed ablation study.</description>

      <title>A Prediction-Traversal Approach for Compressing Scientific Data on Unstructured Meshes with Bounded Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an error-bounded lossy compression approach for reducing scientific data associated with 2D/3D unstructured meshes. While existing lossy compressors offer a high compression ratio with bounded error for regular grid data, methodologies tailored for unstructured mesh data are lacking; for example, one can compress nodal data as 1D arrays, neglecting the spatial coherency of the mesh nodes. Inspired by the SZ compressor, which predicts and quantizes values in a multidimensional array, we dynamically reorganize nodal data into sequences. Each sequence starts with a seed cell; based on a predefined traversal order, the next cell is added to the sequence if the current cell can predict and quantize the nodal data in the next cell with the given error bound. As a result, one can efficiently compress the quantized nodal data in each sequence until all mesh nodes are traversed. This paper also introduces a suite of novel error metrics, namely continuous mean squared error (CMSE) and continuous peak signal-to-noise ratio (CPSNR), to assess compression results for unstructured mesh data. The continuous error metrics are defined by integrating the error function on all cells, providing objective statistics across nonuniformly distributed nodes/cells in the mesh. We evaluate our methods with several scientific simulations ranging from ocean-climate models and computational fluid dynamics simulations with both traditional and continuous error metrics. We demonstrated superior compression ratios and quality than existing lossy compressors.</description>

      <title>NEAT: Distilling 3D Wireframes from Neural Attraction Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of structured 3D reconstruction using wireframes that consist of line segments and junctions, focusing on the computation of structured boundary geometries of scenes. Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

      <description>arXiv:2308.14740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to generate full-body selfies from photographs originally taken at arms length. Because self-captured photos are typically taken close up, they have limited field of view and exaggerated perspective that distorts facial shapes. We instead seek to generate the photo some one else would take of you from a few feet away. Our approach takes as input four selfies of your face and body, a background image, and generates a full-body selfie in a desired target pose. We introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to combine all of this information into high-quality, well-composed photos of you with the desired pose and background.</description>

      <title>Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F): Decorating Untextured Shapes with Distilled Semantic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Diff3F as a simple, robust, and class-agnostic feature descriptor that can be computed for untextured input shapes (meshes or point clouds). Our method distills diffusion features from image foundational models onto input shapes. Specifically, we use the input shapes to produce depth and normal maps as guidance for conditional image synthesis. In the process, we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent, the associated image features are robust and, hence, can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes, without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19, SHREC'20, FAUST, and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features, being semantic instead of geometric, produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

      <title>G3DR: Generative 3D Reconstruction in ImageNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel 3D generative method, Generative 3D Reconstruction (G3DR) in ImageNet, capable of generating diverse and high-quality 3D objects from single images, addressing the limitations of existing methods. At the heart of our framework is a novel depth regularization technique that enables the generation of scenes with high-geometric fidelity. G3DR also leverages a pretrained language-vision model, such as CLIP, to enable reconstruction in novel views and improve the visual realism of generations. Additionally, G3DR designs a simple but effective sampling procedure to further improve the quality of generations. G3DR offers diverse and efficient 3D asset generation based on class or text conditioning. Despite its simplicity, G3DR is able to beat state-of-theart methods, improving over them by up to 22% in perceptual metrics and 90% in geometry scores, while needing only half of the training time.
