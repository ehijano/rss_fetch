      <title>Diffeomorphic Neural Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.</description>

      <title>Computable Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants for the $L^{p}$ de~Rham complex over convex domains and domains with shellable triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct potentials for the exterior derivative, in particular, for the gradient, the curl, and the divergence operators, over domains with shellable triangulations. Notably, the class of shellable triangulations includes local patches (stars) in two or three dimensions. The operator norms of our potentials satisfy explicitly computable bounds that depend only on the geometry. We thus compute upper bounds for constants in Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities and lower bounds for the eigenvalues of vector Laplacians. As an additional result with independent standing, we establish Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities with computable constants for the $L^{p}$ de~Rham complex over bounded convex domains, derived as explicit operator norms of regularized Poincar\'e and Bogovski\u{\i} potential operators. We express all our main results in the calculus of differential forms and treat the gradient, curl, and divergence operators as instances of the exterior derivative. Computational examples illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Modified Cubic B-spline Based Differential Quadrature Methods for Time-fractional Black-Scholes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-fractional Black-Scholes equation (TFBSE) is intended to price the options for which the underlying price fluctuates within a correlated fractal transmission system. Although the TFBSE is an influential approach for grasping the long-term memory traits of financial markets, the non-local nature of fractional derivatives makes significant challenges in finding an accurate solution. We perform an efficient use of the differential quadrature method (DQM) based on modified cubic B-splines to solve the TFBSE governing European options. This paper constructs an algorithm by the combination of time fractional discretization using the finite difference method $L1$ and space discretization using the modified cubic B-spline-based differential quadrature method. Uniform meshes are considered for the discretization of both temporal and spatial domains. Theoretical stability has been established by finding an estimate for the maximum norm of the inverse operator regardless of the involvement of mesh parameters. We trigger the Neumann series theorem to obtain a uniform bound for the inverse operator under reasonable conditions on the mesh parameters. The numerical illustrations show that this implicit numerical method exhibits a fourth-order convergence in the space direction and the order $2-\alpha$ in time. Moreover, we observe an enhancement in order of spatial convergence whenever $\alpha$ tends to $0$. The results obtained are then compared with existing popular techniques to demonstrate the accuracy of modified cubic B-spline-based DQM.</description>

      <title>Onsager Principle-Based Domain Embedding for Thermodynamically Consistent Cahn-Hilliard Model in Arbitrary Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Cahn-Hilliard model in an arbitrary domain with two prescribed boundary conditions is extended to a Cahn-Hilliard-type model in a larger, regular domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The extension is based on the Onsager principle-based domain embedding (OPBDE) method, which has been developed as a systematic domain embedding framework to ensure thermodynamic consistency. By introducing a modified conservation law, the flux at the boundary of the original domain is incorporated into the conservation law as a source term. Our variational approach demonstrates that, even without a prior knowledge on the specific form of the rate of free energy pumped into the system, the Onsager principle remains an effective instrument in deriving the constitutive equation of the extended system. This approach clarifies the intrinsic structure of the extended model in the perspectives of free energy and its dissipation. Asymptotic analysis is carried out for the extended OPBDE Cahn-Hilliard model, demonstrating that the original Cahn-Hilliard model, including its boundary conditions, can be fully recovered. To validate our approach, a structure-preserving numerical scheme is developed to discretize the extended model. Numerical results show that the OPBDE Cahn-Hilliard model is accurate, effective, and robust, highlighting the capability of the OPBDE method in handling gradient flow problems in arbitrary domain geometries.</description>

      <title>Efficient iterative linearised solvers for numerical approximations of stochastic Stefan problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present iterative solvers to approximate the solution of numerical schemes for stochastic Stefan problems. After briefly talking about the convergence results, we tackle the question of efficient strategies for solving the nonlinear equation associated with this scheme. We explore several approaches, from a standard Newton technique to linearised solvers. The latter offer the advantage of using the same coefficient matrix of the linearised system in each nonlinear iteration, for all time steps, and across all realisations of the Brownian motions. As a consequence, the system can be factorised once and for all. Although the linearised approach has a slower convergence rate, our sensitivity analysis and the use of adaptive tolerance in both deterministic and stochastic cases provide valuable insights for choosing the most effective solver across various scenarii.</description>

      <title>Nonconforming approximation methods for function reconstruction on general polygonal meshes via orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce new families of nonconforming approximation methods for reconstructing functions on general polygonal meshes. These methods are defined using degrees of freedom based on weighted moments of orthogonal polynomials and can reproduce higher-degree polynomials. This setting naturally arises in applications where pointwise evaluations are unavailable and only integral measurements over subdomains are accessible. We develop a unisolvence theory and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the associated approximation spaces to be unisolvent. Specifically, it is shown that unisolvence depends on the parity of the product of the polynomial degree~$m$ and the number of polygon edges~$N$. When this condition is not satisfied, we introduce an enrichment strategy involving an additional linear functional and a suitably designed enrichment function to ensure unisolvence. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A novel interpolation-regression approach for function approximation on the disk and its application to cubature formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpolation-regression approximation is a powerful tool in numerical analysis for reconstructing functions defined on square or triangular domains from their evaluations at a regular set of nodes. The importance of this technique lies in its ability to avoid the Runge phenomenon. In this paper, we present a polynomial approximation method based on an interpolation-regression approach for reconstructing functions defined on disk domains from their evaluations at a general set of sampling points. Special attention is devoted to the selection of interpolation nodes to ensure numerical stability, particularly in the context of Zernike polynomials. As an application, the proposed method is used to derive accurate cubature formulas for numerical integration over the disk.</description>

      <title>$C^{\infty}$ rational approximation and quasi-histopolation of functions with jumps through multinode Shepard functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopolation, or interpolation on segments, is a mathematical technique used to approximate a function $f$ over a given interval $I=[a,b]$ by exploiting integral information over a set of subintervals of $I$. Unlike classical polynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations, histopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to classical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known Runge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced nodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous functions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict requirement of passing through all the given data points. This inherent flexibility can reduce the likelihood of oscillatory behavior using, for example, rational approximation operators. In this work, we introduce a $C^{\infty}$ rational quasi-histopolation operator, for bounded (integrable) functions, which reconstruct a function by defeating both the Runge and Gibbs phenomena. A key element of our approach is to blend local histopolation polynomials on a few nodes using multinode Shepard functions as blending functions. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our method.</description>

      <title>Modelling Human Skin Morphology and Simulating Transdermal Transport of 50 Chemicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People use various products containing chemical substances that can diffuse through the human skin barrier and reach deeper layers. Therefore, it is essential to understand the transport mechanisms of these chemicals. We developed computable skin meshes for different anatomical regions of young and old skin in two and three dimensions. Numerical methods were applied to simulate the permeation of 50 chemicals. Diffusion coefficients, partition coefficients, and molecular weights were key factors that influenced diffusion and absorption. These findings provide insights into permeation pathways that can support the development and optimization of pharmaceutical formulations.</description>

      <title>Computational investigation of crack-tip fields in a compressed nonlinear strain-limiting material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite element framework is presented for the analysis of crack-tip phenomena in an elastic material containing a single edge crack under compressive loading. The mechanical response of the material is modeled by a nonlinear constitutive relationship that algebraically relates stress to linearized strain. This approach serves to mitigate non-physical strain singularities and ensures that the crack-tip strains don't grow, unlike singular stresses. A significant advancement is thus achieved in the formulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) for such complex scenarios. The governing equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum and the nonlinear constitutive model, is formulated as a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A classical traction-free boundary condition is imposed on the crack face. The problem is solved using a robust numerical scheme in which a Picard-type linearization is combined with a continuous Galerkin finite element method for the discretization. Analyses are performed for both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic elastic solid containing a crack subjected to compressive loads. The primary crack-tip variables**-stress, strain, and strain energy density-**are examined in detail. It is demonstrated that while high concentrations of compressive stress and strain energy density are observed at the crack tip, the growth of strain is substantially lower than that of stress. These findings are shown to be consistent with the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics, but a more physically meaningful representation of the crack-tip field is provided by the nonlinear approach. A rigorous basis is thus established for investigating fundamental processes like crack propagation and damage in anisotropic, strain-limiting solids under various loading conditions, including compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose weighted and unweighted enrichment strategies to enhance the accuracy of the linear lagrangian finite element for solving the Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We first recall key examples of admissible enrichment functions, specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the linear lagrangian finite element in capturing solution features such as sharp gradients and boundary-layer phenomena. We then introduce two novel three-parameter families of weighted enrichment functions and derive an explicit error bound in $L^2$-norm. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving approximation accuracy, demonstrating its potential for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Robust, fast, and adaptive splitting schemes for nonlinear doubly-degenerate diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear iterative schemes for the time-discrete equations stemming from a class of nonlinear, doubly-degenerate parabolic equations. More precisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for certain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or elliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a splitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a formulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on this splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered, namely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the convergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In the non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the contraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step size. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed to select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its convergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the M-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge irrespective of the mesh. Moreover, the adaptive M-scheme consistently out-competes not only the M/L-schemes, but also the Newton scheme showing quadratic convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Multiresolution Wavelet Neural Network Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a physics-informed multiresolution wavelet neural network (PIMWNN) method is proposed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). This method uses the multiresolution wavelet neural network (MWNN) to approximate unknown functions, then substituting the MWNN into PDEs and training the MWNN by least-squares algorithm. We apply the proposed method to various problems, including stationary/nonstationary advection, diffusion and advection-diffusion problems, and linear/nonlinear time-dependent problems. Numerical experiments show that the PIMWNN method can achieve higher accuracy and faster speed than Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Moreover, the PIMWNN method, being mesh-free, can handle different boundary conditions easily and solve the time-dependent problems efficiently. The proposed method is expected to solve the spectral bias problem in network training. These characteristics show the great potential of the PIMWNN method used in the field of numerical solving methods for PDEs.</description>

Abstract: The low-rank matrix approximation problems within a threshold are widely applied in information retrieval, image processing, background estimation of the video sequence problems and so on. This paper presents an adaptive randomized rank-revealing algorithm of the data matrix $A$, in which the basis matrix $Q$ of the approximate range space is adaptively built block by block, through a recursive deflation procedure on $A$. Detailed analysis of randomized projection schemes are provided to analyze the numerical rank reduce during the deflation. The provable spectral and Frobenius error $(I-QQ^T)A$ of the approximate low-rank matrix $\tilde A=QQ^TA$ are presented, as well as the approximate singular values. This blocked deflation technique is pass-efficient and can accelerate practical computations of large matrices. Applied to image processing and background estimation problems, the blocked randomized algorithm behaves more reliable and more efficient than the known Lanczos-based method and a rank-revealing algorithm proposed by Lee, Li and Zeng (in SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 31 (2009), pp. 503-525).</description>

      <title>Barron Space Representations for Elliptic PDEs with Homogeneous Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube, within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the expressive power of shallow networks in capturing high-dimensional PDE solutions under appropriate structural assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of regularization by projection for solving linear inverse problems if the forward operator is given indirectly but specified via some input-output training pairs. We extend the approach in "Data driven regularization by projection" (Aspri, Korolev, and Scherzer; Inverse Problems; 36 (2020), 125009) to data pairs, which are noisy and, possibly, linearly dependent.</description>

      <title>A $C^{\infty}$ rational quasi-interpolation operator for functions with jumps without the Gibbs phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quasi-interpolation has gained significant importance in numerical analysis and approximation theory due to its versatile applications in scientific and engineering fields. This technique provides a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional interpolation methods by approximating data points without requiring the approximated function to pass exactly through them. This approach is particularly valuable for handling jump discontinuities, where classical interpolation methods often fail due to the Gibbs phenomenon. These discontinuities are common in practical scenarios such as signal processing and computational physics. In this paper, we present a $C^{\infty}$ rational quasi-interpolation operator designed to effectively approximate functions with jump discontinuities while minimizing the issues typically associated with traditional interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Prediction error certification for PINNs: Theory, computation, and application to Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous error estimation is a fundamental topic in numerical analysis. With the increasing use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations, several approaches have been developed to quantify the associated prediction error. In this work, we build upon a semigroup-based framework previously introduced by the authors for estimating the PINN error. While this estimator has so far been limited to academic examples - due to the need to compute quantities related to input-to-state stability - we extend its applicability to a significantly broader class of problems. This is accomplished by modifying the error bound and proposing numerical strategies to approximate the required stability parameters. The extended framework enables the certification of PINN predictions in more realistic scenarios, as demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around a cylinder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we approximate the fractional derivative of a given function using the univariate multinode Shepard method through the Gauss-Jacobi quadrature formula. Subsequently, the proposed method is applied to the numerical solution of boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs), specifically addressing the Bagley-Torvik equations. Experimental results confirm the method's effectiveness, particularly in accurately approximating the Bagley-Torvik equation for both BVPs and IVPs.</description>

      <title>A Note on Eigenvalues of Perturbed Hermitian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $$ A=\left(\begin{array}{cc} H_1 &amp; E^*\\ E &amp; H_2\end{array}\right) \quad \hbox{ and } \quad \wtd A=\left(\begin{array}{cc} H_1 &amp; O\\ O &amp; H_2\end{array}\right)$$ be two $N$-by-$N$ Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_{N}$ and $\wtd \lambda_1 \ge \cdots \ge \wtd \lambda_N$, respectively. \iffalse There are two kinds of perturbation bounds on $|\lambda_i - \wtd \lambda_i|$: 
  $|\lambda_i- \wtd \lambda_i| \le \|E\|$, where $\|E\|$
  is the largest singular value of $\|E\|$, regardless of
  $H_i$'s spectral distributions, and
  $|\lambda_i - \wtd \lambda_i| \le \|E\|^2/\eta$, where $\eta$ is
  the minimum gap between $H_i$'s spectra. \end{enumerate} Bounds of the first kind overestimate the changes when $\|E\|\ll\eta$ while those of the second kind may blow up when $\eta$ is too tiny. \fi Denote by $\|E\|$ the spectral norm of the matrix $E$, and $\eta$ the spectral gap between the spectra of $H_1$ and $H_2$. It is shown that $$ |\lambda_i - \wtd \lambda_i| \le {2\|E\|^2 \over \eta+\sqrt{\eta^2+4\|E\|^2}} \, , $$ which improves all the existing results. Similar bounds are obtained for singular values of matrices under block perturbations.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic approach to spectral analysis of Cauchy-type inverse problems: Convergence and stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive convergence and stability analysis of some probabilistic numerical methods designed to solve Cauchy-type inverse problems is performed in this study. Such inverse problems aim at solving an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) or a system of elliptic PDEs in a bounded Euclidean domain, subject to incomplete boundary and/or internal conditions, and are usually severely ill-posed. In a very recent paper \cite{CiGrMaI}, a probabilistic numerical framework has been developed by the authors, wherein such inverse problems could be analysed thoroughly by simulating the spectrum of some corresponding direct problem and its singular value decomposition based on stochastic representations and Monte Carlo simulations. Herein a full probabilistic error analysis of the aforementioned methods is provided, whereas the convergence of the corresponding approximations is proved and explicit error bounds are provided. This is achieved by employing tools from several areas such as spectral theory, regularity theory for elliptic measures, stochastic representations, and concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Fractal Language Modelling by Universal Sequence Maps (USM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers, popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and, paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process. The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity; and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless, the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be straightforward.</description>

      <title>Efficient data-driven regression for reduced-order modeling of spatial pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient data-driven regression approach for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) of reaction-diffusion systems exhibiting pattern formation. The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Digital Twins via Conditional Neural Whitney Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics, and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations), including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source implementation is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>SGD Convergence under Stepsize Shrinkage in Low-Precision Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$, which slows convergence when $q_{\min} &lt; 1$. Under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique for computer modeling linear filters based on the spectral form of mathematical description of linear systems. It assumes that input and output signals of the filter are represented as orthogonal expansions, while filters themselves are described by two-dimensional non-stationary transfer functions. This technique allows one to model the output signal in continuous time, and it is successfully tested on the Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters with different orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study best $m$-term trigonometric approximation of functions belonging to multivariate weighted Wiener spaces. It has {recently been observed} that best $m$-term trigonometric widths in the uniform and Wiener norm together with nonlinear recovery algorithms stemming from compressed sensing serve to control the optimal sampling recovery error in various relevant spaces of multivariate functions. We use a collection of old and new tools as well as novel findings to extend these recovery bounds. In addition, by establishing embeddings of classical smoothness spaces into weighted Wiener spaces we extend recovery bounds to classical multivariate smoothness spaces.</description>

      <title>A Registration-Based Star-Shape Segmentation Model and Fast Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By combining the level set representation with the registration framework and imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new finite volume framework for solid dynamics based on a momentum-deformation formulation. Building on the C-TOUCH methodology [1], a novel Roe-type Riemann solver is developed to enhance the stability and accuracy of hyperbolic conservation law solutions in solids. The approach naturally handles multidimensional problems and provides a foundation for future extensions to nonlinear and fluid-structure interaction cases. Validation against standard two- and three-dimensional linear elasticity benchmarks demonstrates the method's robustness and accuracy relative to traditional displacement-based approaches, highlighting its promise for large-scale dynamic simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present the Anderson Accelerated Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (AA-PDHG), a fixed-point-based framework designed to overcome the slow convergence of the standard PDHG method for the solution of linear programming (LP) problems. We establish the global convergence of AA-PDHG under a safeguard condition. In addition, we propose a filtered variant (FAA-PDHG) that applies angle and length filtering to preserve the uniform boundedness of the coefficient matrix, a property crucial for guaranteeing convergence. Numerical results show that both AA-PDHG and FAA-PDHG deliver significant speedups over vanilla PDHG for large-scale LP instances.</description>

      <title>Superfast Low Rank Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.11406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low rank approximation of a matrix (hereafter (LRA) is a highly important area of Numerical Linear and Multilinear Algebra and Data Mining and Analysis. One can operate with an LRA superfast -- by using much fewer memory cells and flops than an input matrix M has entries. Can we, however, compute an LRA of a matrix superfast? Yes and no. For worst case inputs, any LRA algorithm fails miserably unless it involves all entries of M, but in computational practice worst case inputs seem to appear rarely, and accurate LRA are routinely obtained superfast for large and important classes of matrices. We test numerically a number of superfast algorithms for various synthetic and real world matrices and consistently arrive at quite accurate LRA. Adequate formal support for these empirical observations is still a challenge, but our upper estimates for the output accuracy of our superfast deterministic LRA algorithms show that they only fail for a very narrow input class and moreover that the spectral and Frobenius error norms of the outputs of our randomized LRA algorithms are expected to stay within a noticeable but reasonable factor from their optima.</description>

      <title>Approximating Analytic Spectra of Hyperbolic Systems with Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to the analytic spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems with variable coefficients. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By considering the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we study systems in which a lower-order term can act as a source of internal energy within the system. We apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by $p = 2, 3, 4$ and $5$. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth to ensure numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We derive the analytic spectrum and find that it is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the analytic) is not obtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate the spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the numerical spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We describe a randomized variant of the block conjugate gradient method for solving a single positive-definite linear system of equations. Our method provably outperforms preconditioned conjugate gradient with a broad-class of Nystr\"om-based preconditioners, without ever explicitly constructing a preconditioner. In analyzing our algorithm, we derive theoretical guarantees for new variants of Nystr\"om preconditioned conjugate gradient which may be of separate interest. We also describe how our approach yields state-of-the-art algorithms for key data-science tasks such as computing the entire ridge regression regularization path and generating multiple independent samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust reformulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, establishing a foundational framework for designing efficient, structure-preserving algorithms that strictly conserve the original energy dissipation law. By leveraging Crank-Nicolson schemes and backward differentiation formulas, we develop four first- and second-order time-discrete schemes. These schemes exactly preserve the original energy dissipation law at each time step, requiring only the solutions of three linear Stokes systems and one $2\times 2$ system of linear equations. Furthermore, the finite difference approximation on a staggered grid is employed for these time-discrete systems to derive fully discrete structure-preserving schemes. We rigorously prove that all proposed fully discrete methods both maintain the original energy dissipation law and admit unique solutions. Moreover, we present their efficient implementation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy, efficacy, and advantageous performance of our newly developed methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part II: Application to Navier-Stokes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear extension of the high-order discretisation framework based on the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method previously introduced for steady linear problems. Building on the concept of an optimal projector defined via the symmetric part of the governing operator, we generalise the formulation to treat the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The approach maintains a clear separation between resolved and unresolved scales, with the fine-scale contribution approximated through the approximate Fine-Scale Greens' function of the associated symmetric operator. This enables a consistent variational treatment of nonlinearity while preserving high-order accuracy. We show that the method yields numerical solutions that closely approximate the optimal projection of the continuous/highly-resolved solution and inherits desirable conservation properties. Particularly, the formulation guarantees discrete conservation of mass, energy, and vorticity, where enstrophy conservation is also achieved when exact or over-integration is employed. Numerical results confirm the framework's robustness, accuracy, and its potential for application to a broad class of nonlinear multiscale problems.</description>

In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a given sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after applying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained via any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence or photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography, which first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then reconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach which computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements. To do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based, regularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the advantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically found in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more stable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence analysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its application to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical implementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiment.</description>

      <title>Accelerating seismic inversion and uncertainty quantification with efficient high-rank Hessian approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient high-rank approximations of the Hessian can accelerate seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) and uncertainty quantification (UQ). In FWI, approximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for Newton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and improving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian approximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the efficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale problems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products, and performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave equations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank methods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We adapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread function method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building on an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that unifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic quadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that these high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational costs in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a low-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little meaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and underestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is overestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated using the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical information about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior variance.</description>

      <title>A generalized ENO reconstruction in compact GKS for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized ENO (GENO)-type nonlinear reconstruction scheme for compressible flow simulations. The proposed reconstruction preserves the accuracy of the linear scheme while maintaining essentially non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities. By generalizing the adaptive philosophy of ENO schemes, the method employs a smooth path function that directly connects high-order linear reconstruction with a reliable lower-order alternative. This direct adaptive approach significantly simplifies the construction of nonlinear schemes, particularly for very high-order methods on unstructured meshes. A comparative analysis with various WENO methods demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the proposed reconstruction, which provides an optimal transition between linear and nonlinear reconstructions across all limiting cases based on stencil smoothness. The consistency and performance of the GENO reconstruction are validated through implementation in both high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes (GKS) and non-compact Riemann-solver-based methods. Benchmark tests confirm the robustness and shock-capturing capabilities of GENO, with particularly superior performance when integrated with compact schemes. This work advances the construction methodology of nonlinear schemes and establishes ENO-type reconstruction as a mature and practical approach for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The developments over the last five decades concerning numerical discretisations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations have lead to reliable tools for their approximation: those include stable methods to properly address the incompressibility constraint, stable discretisations to account for convection dominated problems, efficient time (splitting) methods, and methods to tackle their nonlinear character. While these tools may successfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE models, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of stochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.
  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for the stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the last decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some of those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly applied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these deterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical differences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how modifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if they properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.
  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of prototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also compare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies, and possible limitations. The driving motivation is to reach a better comparison of simulations for new schemes in terms of accuracy and complexities, and to also complement theoretical performance studies for restricted settings of data by more realistic ones.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition with Unaligned Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition that addresses unaligned observations. The mode with unaligned observations is represented using functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We introduce a versatile loss function that effectively accounts for various types of data, including binary, integer-valued, and positive-valued types. Additionally, we propose an optimization algorithm for computing tensor decompositions with unaligned observations, along with a stochastic gradient method to enhance computational efficiency. A sketching algorithm is also introduced to further improve efficiency when using the $\ell_2$ loss function. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methods, we provide illustrative examples using both synthetic data and an early childhood human microbiome dataset.</description>

      <title>chebgreen: Learning and Interpolating Continuous Empirical Green's Functions from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Clamonds solution of the Colebrook-White equation: highest accuracy for engineering purposes with one iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>

      <title>Formulation of entropy-conservative discretizations for compressible flows of thermally perfect gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations that guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level for thermally perfect gases. The procedure is based on a locally conservative formulation, and extends the entropy-conserving schemes to the more realistic case of thermally perfect gases, while still guaranteeing preservation of both linear invariants and kinetic energy. The proposed methodology, which can also be extended to multicomponent gases and to an Asymptotically Entropy-Conservative formulation, shows advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to existing similar approaches.</description>
