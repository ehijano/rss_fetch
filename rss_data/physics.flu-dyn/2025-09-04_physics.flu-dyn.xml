      <title>Optically-Trapped Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a microflow velocimetry based on particle tracking with the aid of the optical trapping of tracers, namely, optically-trapped particle tracking velocimetry (ot-PTV). The ot-PTV has two phases: a trap phase, in which individual tracers are trapped by an optical force and held at a measurement position; a release phase, in which the tracer is released and advected by the fluid flow, without interference from the optical force. The released tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By repeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential images of the tracer that have the same initial position. In this way, we can reduce the effect of statistical noise inherent in the Brownian motion of small tracers, thereby achieving both high spatial resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio, which are necessary for the analysis of extremely slow microflows, such as near-wall creeping flows. The concept of ot-PTV is validated using a benchmark experiment, i.e., a pressure-driven flow in a straight microchannel with a square cross-section.</description>

      <title>From Geostrophic to Magnetically-Damped Turbulence in Liquid Metal Rotating Magnetoconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding planetary core convection dynamics requires the study of convective flows in which the Coriolis and Lorentz forces attain a leading-order, so-called magnetostrophic balance. Experimental investigations of rotating magnetoconvection (RMC) in the magnetostrophic regime are therefore essential to broadly characterize the properties of local-scale planetary core flow. Towards this end, we present here the first thermovelocimetric measurements of magnetostrophic, liquid metal convection, which are made using liquid gallium as the working fluid, at moderate rotation rates (Ekman numbers $10^{-4} \leq Ek\leq 10^{-5}$) and in the presence of dynamically strong magnetic fields (Elsasser number $\Lambda=1$). Complementary rotating convection (RC) experiments are performed at the same rotation rates to serve as reference cases. Our RMC velocity measurements adequately follow a geostrophic turbulent scaling for cases in which local-scale convective inertial forces exceed the Lorentz forces in the fluid bulk. In cases where Lorentz forces exceed local-scale inertia ($N_\ell \gtrsim 3$), the root-mean-square RMC velocities are magnetically damped, yielding values below the geostrophic turbulent RC scaling prediction. An enhancement in heat transfer is observed, which we attribute to the increased coherence of vertically aligned magnetostrophic convective flow. Extrapolating these laboratory results, we predict that convection-scale flows in Earth's core occur in the magnetically damped $N_\ell \gtrsim 3$ regime with Rayleigh number values between $10^{24}$ and $10^{26}$.</description>

      <title>Sequential estimation of disturbed aerodynamic flows from sparse measurements via a reduced latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fast, scalable, and uncertainty-aware methodology for real-time estimation of key aerodynamic states, including instantaneous vorticity fields and aerodynamic loads, during severe gust encounters where strong flow separation and vortex-gust interactions dominate the dynamics. The methodology, trained and tested on high-fidelity simulations of two-dimensional wing-gust encounters with sparse pressure data, combines physics-based ensemble filtering with data-driven surrogate modeling in a learned low-order space. Within this reduced space, latent dynamics and sensor observation operators are learned using neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex aerodynamic responses. These components are embedded within a low-rank Ensemble Kalman Filter (LREnKF), yielding a computationally efficient scheme that combines data-driven expressivity with physical interpretability in the original high-dimensional space. Because assimilation occurs entirely within the latent space, updates are fast enough for real-time use, ensuring that aerodynamic states can be continuously estimated from streaming pressure data. The filter corrects predictions predominantly in directions that are both dynamically significant and observable, improving efficiency and reducing spurious adjustments. An observability analysis shows how sensor informativeness evolves during wing-gust interactions, and sensor dropout experiments demonstrate that the LREnKF adaptively re-weights neighboring sensors to preserve estimation quality under degraded sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards Physics Constrained Deep Learning Based Turbulence Model Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence Models represent the workhorse for simulations used in engineering design and analysis. Despite their low computational cost and robustness, these models suffer from substantial predictive uncertainty, most of which is epistemic. At present, the Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is the only approach to estimate these turbulence model uncertainties, using physics based perturbation to the predicted Reynolds stresses. While the EPM address the question of how to perturb the Reynolds stresses for uncertainty estimation, it does not address how much to perturb. This shortcoming leads to very generous uncertainty bounds that result in sub-optimal designs. In this investigation, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the discrepancy between predicted and actual turbulent flows. These can be utilized to modulate the degree of the perturbations in the EPM leading to a Physics Constrained Deep Learning approach for Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes model uncertainty quantification. We test this approach on turbulent flows over aero-foils and periodic hills to show the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Entry and penetration of a superhydrophobic sphere into a deep pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally examines the entry and penetration of a superhydrophobic sphere into a quiescent deep pool, with special emphasis placed on the primary and secondary pinch-off of the air cavity existing in its wake. Two aspects are novel in this study. For one, the experiments are performed for a large range of dimensionless sphere densities, where lighter spheres, with their air cavity, exhibit a terminally ascending trajectory and heavier spheres a terminally descending trajectory. The second novel result is a strong correlation of primary and secondary pinch-off times with the Froude number at impact and the dimensionless density. A semi-empirical correlation for the air cavity volume following the primary pinch-off shows excellent agreement with measurements over all dimensionless densities. A scalar force balance predicts a drastic decrease of buoyancy upon pinch-off, reflected also in the abrupt change of deceleration, measured using two orthogonally placed high-speed cameras to capture the time resolved trajectory of the sphere in the pool. Comparisons are drawn between the trajectories of superhydrophobic spheres and those of hydrophilic spheres, measured in a previous study.</description>

      <title>Design of the wavy wall in a partially heated channel using CFD simulations and human-assisted Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores heated wavy wall shape design in channel flow using machine learning, aiming to minimize temperature variation ($\sigma_T$) while limiting pressure loss ($\Delta p$). A cost function $J$ defined as a product of $\sigma_T$ and $\Delta p$ balances these competing objectives. Optimization is performed via Bayesian optimization (BO) coupled with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations in an active learning loop involving up to 1000 subsequent iterations. Two shaping strategies are considered: a sinusoidal-type function defined by four parameters (two waviness amplitudes, wave count, and tilt), and a higher-dimensional approach employing a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Polynomial (PCHIP) with 19 control points. Results show the sinusoidal design reduces $\sigma_T$ over $60$-fold but increases $\Delta p$ fourfold, while the PCHIP shape offers only a $15$-fold $\sigma_T$ reduction but with a twofold $\Delta p$ increase. Flow characteristics such as turbulent kinetic energy, pressure, temperature, and Nusselt number are examined for both optimal and suboptimal shapes along the Pareto front. The insights gained motivated a human-aided refinement of the BO result, leading to a further $17.7$\% reduction in $J$. This was achieved by replacing small-amplitude waviness periods with flat segments, which additionally significantly facilitates manufacturability.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of thermodiffusively unstable counterflow lean premixed hydrogen flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of increasing strain rate on thermodiffusively unstable, lean premixed hydrogen flames in a 2D counterflow configuration through detailed-chemistry numerical simulations for the first time. The analysis of transient flame dynamics without imposed perturbations reveals that a steady-state flame front is achieved only when the strain rate exceeds a certain threshold. Below this threshold, the flame exhibits unstable oscillatory behavior. When subjected to a range of perturbation wavelengths, the flame front exhibits an exponentially increasing wavelength over time, driven by the flame-tangential velocity component, with the applied strain rate acting as the amplification factor. It is shown that any perturbation is damped at sufficiently high applied strain rate conditions after a transient phase. At these high strain regimes, the growth rate transient follows a characteristic onset that depends uniquely on the initial perturbation wavelength and exhibits a linear dependence on the applied strain rate.</description>

      <title>Steady inertial flow of a compressible fluid in a spatially periodic channel under large pressure drops: a multiscale semi-analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-periodic channels are increasingly attracting attention as an efficient alternative to packed columns for a number of analytical and engineering processes. In incompressible flows, the periodic geometry allows to compute the flow structure by solving the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in the minimal periodic cell of the structure, however large the pressure gradient. Besides, when gas flow under large pressure drops are dealt with, the velocity field is not periodic because of the density dependence on pressure. In this case, the momentum balance equations must be solved numerically on the entire channel, thereby requiring massive computational effort. Based on the marked separation of scales between the length of the periodic cell and the overall channel length characterizing many applications we develop a general method for predicting both the large-scale pressure and velocity profiles, and the small-scale flow structure. The approach proposed is based on the assumption that the local dimensionless pressure drop as a function of the Reynolds number, say $g({\rm Re})$, can be estimated from the solution of the incompressible NS equations within the minimal periodic cell of the channel. From the knowledge of $g({\rm Re})$, the pressure profile $P(Z)$ vs the large scale axial coordinate $Z$ is derived analytically by quadratures. We show how qualitatively different profiles $P(Z)$ can be obtained depending on the equation of state the gas. The approach is validated by comparing the predicted profiles with the full-scale numerical solution of the compressible NS equations in different axially-symmetric periodic channel geometries.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs), where shear-driven turbulence between dense and diffuse phases produces intermediate-temperature gas with short cooling times, are ubiquitous in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Drawing an analogy with Reynolds' decomposition, we perform a quasi-steady-state analysis of TRMLs, separating fields into mean and turbulent components. In the quasi-isobaric TRML, upstream gas cools and compresses before streamwise momentum is fully mixed across the shear layer, which exhibits the expected negative turbulent shear stress $R_{xz}$ that steadily spreads into the cold phase. The thermal pressure reaches a minimum within the TRML, compensated by a positive vertical compressive stress $R_{zz}$. The sum of upstream ram and thermal pressures balances the downstream thermal pressure. Radiative losses are offset by enthalpy dissipation, with a negative turbulent heat flux $Q_{z}$ indicating thermal transport within the TRML. The volume-averaged temperature profile is well fit by a tanh function -- an emergent property that, for the first time, enables a predictive theory for TRMLs consistent with numerical experiments, including the universality of their temperature-dependent emissivity distributions.</description>

      <title>Canonical correlation decomposition of numerical and experimental data for observable diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A flow decomposition method based on canonical correlation analysis is proposed in this paper to optimally dissect complex flows into mutually orthogonal modes that are ranked by their cross-correlation with an observable. It is particularly suitable for identifying the observable-correlated flow structures while effectively excluding those uncorrelated, even though they may be highly energetic. Therefore, this method is capable of extracting coherent flow features under low signal-to-noise ratios. A numerical validation is conducted and shows that the method can robustly identify the observable-correlated flow events even though the underlying signal is corrupted by random noise that is four orders of magnitude stronger. The temporal sampling frequency and duration of the observable determine the maximum and minimum frequencies to be resolved in the cross-correlation respectively, while those of the flow are to ensure convergence. These criteria are validated using synthetic examples. The decomposition method is subsequently used to analyse a turbulent channel flow, a subsonic turbulent jet and an unsteady vortex shedding from a cylinder, showing the effectiveness of observable-correlated structure identification and order reduction. This decomposition represents a data-driven method of effective order reduction for highly noisy numerical and experimental data and is suitable for identifying the source and descendent events of a given observable. It is hoped that this method will join the existing flow diagnosis tools, in particular for observable-related diagnosis and control.</description>

      <title>Topological Pathways to Two-Dimensional Quantum Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion via iterative quantitative homogenization: an overview of the main ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>
