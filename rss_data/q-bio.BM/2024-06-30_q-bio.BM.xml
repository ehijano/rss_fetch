      <title>Importance Weighted Expectation-Maximization for Protein Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences with desired biological function is crucial in biology and chemistry. Recent machine learning methods use a surrogate sequence-function model to replace the expensive wet-lab validation. How can we efficiently generate diverse and novel protein sequences with high fitness? In this paper, we propose IsEM-Pro, an approach to generate protein sequences towards a given fitness criterion. At its core, IsEM-Pro is a latent generative model, augmented by combinatorial structure features from a separately learned Markov random fields (MRFs). We develop an Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization method (MCEM) to learn the model. During inference, sampling from its latent space enhances diversity while its MRFs features guide the exploration in high fitness regions. Experiments on eight protein sequence design tasks show that our IsEM-Pro outperforms the previous best methods by at least 55% on average fitness score and generates more diverse and novel protein sequences.</description>

      <title>3D-Mol: A Novel Contrastive Learning Framework for Molecular Property Prediction with 3D Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction, crucial for early drug candidate screening and optimization, has seen advancements with deep learning-based methods. While deep learning-based methods have advanced considerably, they often fall short in fully leveraging 3D spatial information. Specifically, current molecular encoding techniques tend to inadequately extract spatial information, leading to ambiguous representations where a single one might represent multiple distinct molecules. Moreover, existing molecular modeling methods focus predominantly on the most stable 3D conformations, neglecting other viable conformations present in reality. To address these issues, we propose 3D-Mol, a novel approach designed for more accurate spatial structure representation. It deconstructs molecules into three hierarchical graphs to better extract geometric information. Additionally, 3D-Mol leverages contrastive learning for pretraining on 20 million unlabeled data, treating their conformations with identical topological structures as weighted positive pairs and contrasting ones as negatives, based on the similarity of their 3D conformation descriptors and fingerprints. We compare 3D-Mol with various state-of-the-art baselines on 7 benchmarks and demonstrate our outstanding performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of Domain Knowledge and Multi-Modality on Intelligent Molecular Property Prediction: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise prediction of molecular properties is essential for advancements in drug development, particularly in virtual screening and compound optimization. The recent introduction of numerous deep learning-based methods has shown remarkable potential in enhancing molecular property prediction (MPP), especially improving accuracy and insights into molecular structures. Yet, two critical questions arise: does the integration of domain knowledge augment the accuracy of molecular property prediction and does employing multi-modal data fusion yield more precise results than unique data source methods? To explore these matters, we comprehensively review and quantitatively analyze recent deep learning methods based on various benchmarks. We discover that integrating molecular information significantly improves molecular property prediction (MPP) for both regression and classification tasks. Specifically, regression improvements, measured by reductions in root mean square error (RMSE), are up to 4.0%, while classification enhancements, measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), are up to 1.7%. We also discover that enriching 2D graphs with 1D SMILES boosts multi-modal learning performance for regression tasks by up to 9.1%, and augmenting 2D graphs with 3D information increases performance for classification tasks by up to 13.2%, with both enhancements measured using ROC-AUC. The two consolidated insights offer crucial guidance for future advancements in drug discovery.</description>
