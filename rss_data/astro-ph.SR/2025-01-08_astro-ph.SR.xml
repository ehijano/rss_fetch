      <title>The Variable X-ray Emission of the Cataclysmic Variable V1460 Her with a Rapidly Rotating White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recent Chandra ACIS observation of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) V1460 Her (2MASS J16211735+4412541) with a fast-rotating ($P_{\rm spin} = 38.9$~s) white dwarf, we estimated a flux $F_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}}^{\rm abs} = (1.9\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\sim7$ lower than found from previous Swift XRT observations $\approx8$ years ago, when the CV was quiescent. The drop in the flux suggests a corresponding drop in the accretion rate, and the resulting intrinsic luminosity $L_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}} \sim 1.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ places V1460 Her among the lowest-luminosity magnetic CVs known, in a state of very low accretion.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On stellar hotspots due to star-planet magnetic interactions: How much power can actually be transmitted to the chromosphere?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism for generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of $10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by Alfv\'en waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates where and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat. The stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of cool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfv\'en speed over a short distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfv\'en waves at the transition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency of energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection of the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the stellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the frequency-dependent propagation of Alfv\'en waves through a realistic background stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of the wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to characterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several candidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected. Low-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency waves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies. Conversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfv\'en waves substantially diminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result, there exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A significant fraction of the Alfv\'en wave energy is reflected at the stellar transition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency to the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.</description>

      <title>The fragmentation of molecular clouds in starburst environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant amount of star formation occurs and has occurred in environments unlike the solar neighbourhood. The majority of stars formed closer to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate (z &gt; 1.3) and a great deal of star formation presently occurs in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. These environments are unified by the presence of a high interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). Numerical studies of stellar birth typically neglect this fact, and those that do not have thus far been limited in scope. In this work we present the first comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation in extreme environments where we have increased the ISRF and CRIR to values typical of the CMZ and starburst galaxies. We note changes in the fragmentation behaviour on both the core and stellar system scale, leading to top-heavy core and stellar system mass functions in high ISRF/CRIR clouds. Clouds fragment less on the core scale, producing fewer but more massive cores. Conversely, the cores fragment more intensely and produce richer clusters of stellar systems. We present a picture where high ISRF/CRIR clouds fragment less on the scale of cores and clumps, but more on the scale of stellar systems. The change in fragmentation behaviour subsequently changes the mass function of the stellar systems that form through enhanced accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycle Variation of Axial Orientations and Favorable Locations of Eruptive MFRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multi-viewpoint observations from STEREO and SOHO during three solar cycles from 23 to 25, we study the magnetic flux rope (MFR) structures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun and magnetic clouds (MCs) at 1au. The study aims to investigate two phenomena: 1) the occurrence rate of CMEs near Hale sector boundaries (HBs) and 2) solar-cycle variation of MFR axial orientations in CMEs and MCs. Our preliminary results include: 1) the axes of MFRs in cycle 25 present a systematic northward orientation, which is the same as in cycle 23 but opposite to cycle 24; 2) the majority of the MFRs occurred near HBs (within 30 degrees) and some exceptional events occurred at non-HBs; 3) the axial fields in MCs present a similar north-south orientation, which changes from cycle to cycle. We discuss the implication of solar cycle variations of MFR axial orientations for space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Strong evidence of low levels of solar activity during the Maunder Minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maunder Minimum (MM) was a period of prolonged solar activity minimum between 1645 and 1715. Several works have identified a significant number of problematic spotless days in the MM included in existing databases. We have found a list of exact spotless (in the second half of 1709) and spot days (January and August 1709) provided by Johann Heinrich Muller. We computed the most probable value and upper/lower limits of the active day fraction (ADF) from Muller's data using the hypergeometrical probability distribution. Our sample is not strictly random because Muller recorded observations in consecutive days when he observed sunspots. Therefore, our result represents an upper threshold of solar activity for 1709. We compared this result with annual values of the ADF calculated for the Dalton Minimum and the most recent solar cycles. We concluded that it was less active than most years both in the Dalton Minimum and in the most recent solar cycles. Therefore, the solar activity level estimated in this work for 1709 represents robust evidence of low solar activity levels in the MM.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple-lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple-source, and 8.8% have a multiple-lens and a multiple-source. The majority of these events have photometric lightcurves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens-binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for singles and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of singles and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE (arXiv:1707.07634) than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.</description>

      <title>High Resolution {\it BOES} Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He~II$\lambda$6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at $\sim$ 6545~\AA. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from April 2019 to March 2020 using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph ({\it BOES}). Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered \ion{He}{2} at 6545~\AA\ in NGC~6881 and NGC~6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC~6741 and NGC~6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the \ion{H}{1} component relative to the \ion{He}{2} emission region ranges from $26-33~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC~6881, NGC~6741, NGC~6886, and NGC~6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of \ion{H}{1} components with masses around $10^{-2}~M_\odot$, moving outward from the central \ion{He}{2} emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.</description>

      <title>Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.</description>

      <title>The fine-scale structure of polar coronal holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Using the STIX background detector as a proxy for GOES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-Rays (STIX) onboard Solar Orbiter was designed to observe solar flares in the X-ray range of 4-150 keV, providing spectral, temporal and spatial information. Besides 30 imaging detectors, STIX has two additional detectors, the coarse flare locator (CFL) and the background (BKG) detector. Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.
  Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.
  Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.
  Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5 $\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.</description>

      <title>Effects of energetic particles produced by magnetic reconnection on discs of young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.
  The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.
  We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the properties of macroscopic transport in the Sun from combined lithium and beryllium depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Sun is a privileged laboratory of stellar evolution, thanks to the quality and complementary nature of available constraints. Using these observations, we are able to draw a detailed picture of its internal structure and dynamics which form the basis of the successes of solar modelling. Amongst such constraints, the depletion of lithium and beryllium are key tracers of the required efficiency and extent of macroscopic mixing just below the solar convective envelope. Thanks to revised determinations of these abundances, we may use them in conjunction with other existing spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints to study in detail the properties of macroscopic transport. Aims. We aim at constraining the efficiency of macroscopic transport at the base of the convective envelope and determining the compatibility of the observations with a suggested candidate linked with the transport of angular momentum in the solar radiative interior. Methods. We use recent spectroscopic observations of lithium and beryllium abundance and include them in solar evolutionary model calibrations. We test the agreement of such models in terms of position of the convective envelope, helium mass fraction in convective zone, sound speed profile inversions and neutrino fluxes. Results. We constrain the required efficiency and extent of the macroscopic mixing at the base of the solar convective envelope, finding that a power law of density with an index n between 3 and 6 would reproduce the data, with efficiencies at the base of the envelope of about 6000 cm2 /s, depending on the value of n. We also confirm that macroscopic mixing worsens the agreement with neutrino fluxes and that the current implementations of the magnetic Tayler instability are unable to explain the observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a much higher abundance of Classical Be stars (CBe) than typical open clusters. We perform a membership analysis using GAIA DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be 3.6 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc. We identify 499 GAIA-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.5 M$\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.2 %. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using standard deviation, median absolute deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66 % of CBe stars are variable: 23 % show periodic signals from pulsation or rotation, 41 \% exhibit variability from disk dynamics or binarity, and 14 % have long-term variations due to disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50 \% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50 % are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.</description>

      <title>High-frequency coronal Alfv\'enic waves observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence and nature of low-frequency (0.1-10~mHz) Alfv\'enic waves in the corona has been established over the last decade, with many of these results coming from coronagraphic observations of the infrared Fe XIII line. The Cryo-NIRSP instrument situated at DKIST has recently begun acquiring science quality data of the same Fe XIII line, with at least a factor of 9 improvement in spatial resolution, a factor 30 increase in temporal resolution and an increase in signal-to-noise, when compared to the majority of previously available data. Here we present an analysis of 1~s cadence sit-and-stare data from Cryo-NIRSP, examining the Doppler velocity fluctuations associated with the Fe XIII 1074~nm coronal line. We are able to confirm previous results of Alfv\'enic waves in the corona as well as explore a new frequency regime. The data reveals that the power law behaviour of the Doppler velocity power spectrum extends to higher frequencies. This result appears to challenge some models of photospheric-driven Alfv\'enic waves that predict a lack of high frequency wave power in the corona due to strong chromospheric damping. Moreover, the high-frequency waves do not transport as much energy as their low-frequency counterparts, with less time-averaged energy per frequency interval. We are also able to confirm the incompressible nature of the fluctuations with little coherence between the line amplitude and Doppler velocity time-series.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing binary systems with $\beta$ Cephei components. V1216 Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the high-mass binary system V1216 Sco, an eclipsing Algol-type binary hosting a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator, with an orbital period of 3.92 days. This system was analyzed using TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy from SALT HRS to investigate its orbital parameters, stellar properties, and evolutionary history. The TESS light curve, comprising over 12000 data points, revealed five independent pulsation frequencies within the beta Cephei range of 5 to 7 d$^{-1}$.
  Spectroscopic analysis provided radial velocities and disentangled atmospheric parameters, enabling precise orbital and evolutionary modeling. The system features a primary star of 11.72 M$_{\odot}$ and a secondary of 4.34 M$_{\odot}$. The secondary star has a radius near its Roche lobe, indicating recent or ongoing mass transfer. Evolutionary modeling with MESA-binary suggests that V1216 Sco underwent a case A mass transfer scenario, where mass transfer began while the donor was still on the main sequence. The system's evolutionary models indicate an age of 15 to 30 million years, highlighting the significant impact of binary interactions on stellar evolution.
  This study underscores the value of combining observational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex systems like V1216 Sco, emphasizing the role of mass transfer in shaping binary star evolution.</description>

      <title>The occurrence of powerful flares stronger than X10 class in Solar Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares stronger than X10 (S-flares, &gt;X10) are the highest class flares which significantly impact on the Sun's evolution and space weather. Based on observations of Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) at soft X-ray (SXR) wavelength and the daily sunspot numbers (DSNs) since 1975, we obtained some interesting and heuristic conclusions: (1) Both S-flares and the more powerful extremely strong flares (ES-flares, &gt;X14.3) mostly occur in the late phases of solar cycles and low-latitude regions on the solar disk; (2) Similar to X-class flares, the occurrence of S-flares in each solar cycle is somewhat random, but the occurrence of ES-flares seems to be dominated by the mean DSN (Vm) and its root-mean-square deviation during the valley phase (Vd) before the cycle: the ES-flare number is strongly correlated with Vd, and the occurrence time of the first ES-flare is anti-correlated with Vd and Vm. These facts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the more the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred. We proposed that the Sun may have a low-latitude active zone (LAZ), and most ES-flares are generated from the interaction between LAZ and the newly emerging active regions. The correlations and the linear regression functions may provide an useful method to predict the occurrence of ES-flares in an upcoming solar cycle, which derives that solar cycle 25 will have about 2 ES-flares after the spring of 2027.</description>

      <title>Mixing by Internal Gravity Waves in Stars: Assessing Numerical Simulations Against Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a study of radial chemical mixing in non-rotating massive main-sequence stars driven by internal gravity waves (IGWs), based on multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the fully compressible code MUSIC. We examine two proposed mechanisms of material mixing in stars by IGWs that are commonly quoted, relating to thermal diffusion and sub-wavelength shearing. Thermal diffusion provides a non-restorative effect to the waves, leaving material displaced from its previous equilibrium, while shearing arising within the waves drives weak localised flows, mixing the fluid there. Using IGW spectra from the simulations, we evaluate theoretical predictions of mixing rates due to these mechanisms. We show, for $20M_\odot$ main-sequence stars, that neither of these mechanisms are likely to create mixing sufficient to correct inaccuracies in current stellar evolution models. Furthermore, we compare these predictions to results obtained from Lagrangian tracer particles, following a method recently used for global simulations of stellar interiors to measure mixing by IGWs in their radiative zones. We demonstrate that tracer particle methods face significant numerical challenges in measuring the small diffusion coefficients predicted by the aforementioned theories, for which they are prone to yielding artificially enhanced coefficients. Diffusion coefficients based on such methods are currently used with stellar evolution codes for asteroseismic studies, but should be viewed with caution. Finally, in a case where tracer particles do not suffer from numerical artefacts, we suggest that a diffusion model is not suitable for timescales typically considered by two-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam: New multi-band templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.</description>

      <title>Eruptive YSOs in Cygnus-X: a mid-infrared variability study with NEOWISE and SPICY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.</description>

      <title>Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Tracking Star-Forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars, and the impact of turbulence, is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2, 10$. Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2$ model. In the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.</description>

      <title>Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$. The GCs closer to the Galactic plane (GP) tend to have larger RM. This is consistent with previous study (\citealt{Hutschenreuter2022}).</description>

      <title>Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.</description>

      <title>Twinkle: A GPU-based binary-lens microlensing code with contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (&gt;~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]&gt;-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03513v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available: doi: 10.12149/101503 (https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101504/).</description>

      <title>The impact of mass uncertainties on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions of element yields from the rapid neutron capture (r-) process are subject to large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of matter ejection. A major source of uncertainty in determining ejecta composition and radioactive decay heat is the lack of nuclear mass data for exotic neutron-rich nuclei produced during neutron irradiation.
  We examine both model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and their impact on r-process nucleosynthesis, and consequently, the composition of neutron star merger ejecta. To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear mass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a backward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from local variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known masses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.
  These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find that uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance uncertainties of 20% up to A $\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with peaks around A $\simeq$ 140 and A $\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of 100-300%. While correlated model uncertainties generally exceed parameter uncertainties for most nuclei, both have a significant impact on heavy element production.
  Overall, improvements in nuclear models are essential to reducing uncertainties in r-process predictions. Both correlated model uncertainties and coherent determination of parameter uncertainties are crucial for sensitivity analysis in r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Transport of Energetic Particles at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>An absolute mass, precise age, and hints of planetary winds for WASP-121 A and b from a JWST NIRSpec phase curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted a planetary radial velocity measurement of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b using JWST NIRSpec phase curve data. Our analysis reveals the Doppler shift of the planetary spectral lines across the full orbit, which shifts considerably across the detector ($\sim$ 10 pixels). Using cross-correlation techniques, we have determined an overall planetary velocity amplitude of $K_{\rm p}=215.7\pm1.1$ km/s, which is in good agreement with the expected value. We have also calculated the dynamical mass for both components of the system by treating it as an eclipsing double-line spectroscopic binary, with WASP-121A having a mass of M$_{\star}$=1.330 $\pm$ 0.019 M$_{\odot}$, while WASP-121b has a mass of M$_{\rm p}$= 1.170 $\pm$ 0.043 M$_{\rm Jup}$. These dynamical measurements are $\sim3\times$ more precise than previous estimates and do not rely on any stellar modeling assumptions which have a $\sim$5\% systematic floor mass uncertainty. Additionally, we used stellar evolution modeling constrained with a stellar density and parallax measurement to determine a precise age for the system, found to be 1.11 $\pm$ 0.14 Gyr. Finally, we observed potential velocity differences between the two NIRSpec detectors, with NRS1 lower by 5.5$\pm$2.2 km/s. We suggest that differences can arise from day/night asymmetries in the thermal emission, which can lead to a sensitivity bias favoring the illuminated side of the planet, with planetary rotation and winds both acting to lower a measured $K_{\rm P}$. The planet's rotation can account for 1 km/s of the observed velocity difference, with 4.5$\pm$2.2 km/s potentially attributable to vertical differences in wind speeds.</description>

      <title>ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and faster acceleration going toward the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at 55, 67 and 86 au from the star, coincident with regions of enhanced gas density in the disk. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted in rings of enhanced gas density could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signal, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently, we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5%, the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.49 $M_{\odot}$and a relative error precision of 0.13.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GTC-OSIRIS phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of three compact binary MSPs, or 'spiders': PSR J1048+2339, PSR J1810+1744, and (for the first time) PSR J1908+2105. For the companion in each system, the temperature is traced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial velocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring them, resulting in different radial velocity curve semi-amplitudes: for J1048 ($K_\mathrm{metals, red} = 344 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{metals, blue} = 372 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\mathrm{Balmer} = 448 \pm 19$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{metals} = 491 \pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing inclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses $M_\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\odot$ for J1048, and $M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 1.7$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\odot$ for J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 &lt; 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 0.55$ and inclination $i &lt; 6.0^\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest mass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the origins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of asymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908. We also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and demonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\phi = 0.25, 0.75$) is essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional constraints on photometric modelling.</description>

Abstract: On April 1, 2471 bC an impressive, unpredictable phenomenon occurred over the Delta of the Nile: a total solar eclipse, with totality band almost centered on the sacred city of Buto, and with the capital Memphis very close (&gt;95%) to totality. This date is compatible with existing chronologies for the reign of Pharaoh Shepseskaf, who adopted a clamorous symbolic break with respect to the tradition of solarized kings started by Khufu. Indeed his tomb was not built in view from Heliopolis and was not a pyramid, but a kind of unique monument resembling the symbolic shrine at Buto. The aim of the present paper is to investigate in a systematic way the possibility that the origin of this historical break, which marks the end of the 4th dynasty, can be identified precisely in the 2471 bC eclipse, therefore furnishing a new astronomical anchor for the chronology of the Old Kingdom.</description>
