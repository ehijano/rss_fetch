      <title>Dissipative frequency converter: from Lindblad dynamics to non-Hermitian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis. The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case. Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the full Lindblad dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long relaxation of a Kramers qubit formed in a bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene a unique platform for emerging types of semiconducting qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy where the two states have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. By breaking the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a novel type of qubit (Kramers qubit), encoded in the two-dimensional spin-valley subspace, becomes accessible. The Kramers qubit is robust against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms, as it requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers, potentially resulting in long relaxation and coherence times. We measure the relaxation time of a single carrier in the excited states of a bilayer graphene quantum dot at small ($\sim \mathrm{mT}$) and zero magnetic fields. We demonstrate ultra-long spin-valley relaxation times of the Kramers qubit exceeding $30~\mathrm{s}$, which is about two orders of magnitude longer than the spin relaxation time of $400~\mathrm{ms}$. The demonstrated high-fidelity single-shot readout and long relaxation times are the foundation for novel, long-lived semiconductor qubits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon-phonon cavity for large-amplitude terahertz spin-wave excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spin waves or their quanta, magnons, can be efficiently excited by acoustic phonons because these excitations have similar wavevectors in the THz regime. THz acoustic phonons can be produced using photoacoustic phenomena but typically have a low population and thus a relatively low displacement amplitude. The magnetization amplitude and population of the acoustically excited THz magnons are thus usually small. Using analytical calculations and dynamical phase-field simulations, we show that a freestanding metal/magnetic-insulator (MI)/dielectric multilayer can be designed to produce large-amplitude THz spin wave via cavity-enhanced magnon-phonon interaction. The amplitude of the acoustically excited THz spin wave in the freestanding multilayer is predicted to be more than ten times larger than in a substrate-supported multilayer. Acoustically excited nonlinear magnon-magnon interaction is demonstrated in the freestanding multilayer. The simulations also indicate that the magnon modes can be detected by probing the charge current in the metal layer generated via spin-charge conversion across the MI/metal interface and the resulting THz radiation. Applications of the freestanding multilayer in THz optoelectronic transduction are computationally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Unique electronic and optical properties of stacking-modulated bilayer graphene under external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the magneto-electronic and magneto-optical properties of stacking-modulated bilayer graphene. By manipulating domain walls (DWs) across AB-BA domains periodically, we unveil oscillatory Landau subbands and the associated optical excitations. The DWs act as periodic potentials, yielding fascinating 1D spectral features. Our exploration reveals 1D phenomena localized to Bernal stacking, DW regions, and stacking boundaries, highlighting the intriguing formation of Landau state quantization influenced by the commensuration between the magnetic length and the system. The stable quantized localization within different regions leads to the emergence of unconventional quantized subbands. This study provides valuable insights into the essential properties of stacking-modulated bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Sub-100-fs formation of dark excitons in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides are promising for electronics and optoelectronics applications owing to their properties governed by strongly-bound bright and dark excitons. Momentum-forbidden dark excitons have recently received attention as better alternatives to bright excitons for long-range transport. However, accessing the dynamics of dark excitons is challenging experimentally. The most direct, but very complicated, experiment is transient angle-resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy: sub-100-fs formation of K-$\Lambda$-excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ has been identified previously taking advantage of momentum resolution of detected signals [1]. Here, we use a simpler setting of transient photoemission electron microscopy (with spatial resolution of 75 nm), which is inherently sensitive to dark K-$\Lambda$ excitons in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenide and has exceptionally high temporal resolution of 13 fs. We are able to directly observe intervalley scattering (dark-exciton formation) in monolayer WS$_2$ with scattering rates in the range of 14-50 fs followed by picosecond-scale dynamics mediated by defects.</description>

      <title>Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

Abstract: Single crystals of Mn0.03Bi1.97Se3 were synthesized by modified Bridgman technique and phase purity was confirmed via XRD analysis. EDAX analysis has verified the stoichiometric ratio of elements in the sample. Sample flakes were transferred to the SiO2/Si n-type substrate by mechanical exfoliation technique. Four probe gold contacts were etched with the help of e-beam lithography by masking and lift off process. Resistivity measurement was performed in four probe configurations in 2-300 K temperature range. We report evidence for Kon-do effect in Mn0.03Bi1.97Se3 micro-flakes with Tmin of 14.4 K.</description>

      <title>Stability of Weyl node merging processes under symmetry constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in the number of Weyl nodes in Weyl semimetals occur through merging processes, usually involving a pair of oppositely charged nodes. More complicated processes involving multiple Weyl nodes are also possible, but they typically require fine tuning and are thus less stable. In this work, we study how symmetries affect the allowed merging processes and their stability, focusing on the combination of a two-fold rotation and time-reversal ($C_2\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. We find that, counter-intuitively, processes involving a merging of three nodes are more generic than processes involving only two nodes. Our work suggests that multi-Weyl-merging may be observed in a large variety of quantum materials, and we discuss SrSi$_2$ and bilayer graphene as potential candidates</description>

      <title>Impact of spin-entropy on the thermoelectric properties of a 2D magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat-to-charge conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials is closely linked to the entropy per charge carrier. Thus, magnetic materials are promising building blocks for highly efficient energy harvesters, as their carrier entropy is boosted by a spin degree of freedom. In this work, we investigate how this spin entropy impacts heat-to-charge conversion in A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr. We perform simultaneous measurements of electrical conductance and thermocurrent while changing magnetic order using temperature and magnetic field as tuning parameters. We find a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric power factor around the N\'eel temperature. We further reveal that the power factor at low temperature can be increased by up to 600% upon applying a magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that the thermoelectric properties of 2D magnets can be optimized by exploiting the sizeable impact of spin entropy and confirm thermoelectric measurements as a sensitive tool to investigate subtle magnetic phase transitions in low-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved counting statistics as a sensitive probe of spin correlation in transport through a quantum dot spin valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the noise in spin transport through a single quantum dot (QD) tunnel coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes with noncollinear magnetizations. Based on a spin-resolved quantum master equation, auto- and cross-correlations of spin-resolved currents are analyzed to reveal the underlying spin transport dynamics and characteristics for various polarizations. We find the currents of majority and minority spins could be strongly autocorrelated despite uncorrelated charge transfer. The interplay between tunnel coupling and the Coulomb interaction gives rise to an exchange magnetic field, leading to the precession of the accumulated spin in the QD. It strongly suppresses the bunching of spin tunneling events and results in a unique double-peak structure in the noise of the net spin current. The spin autocorrelation is found to be susceptible to magnetization alignments, which may serve as a sensitive tool to measure the magnetization directions between the ferromagnetic electrodes.</description>

      <title>Coupling of quantum-dot states via elastic-cotunneling and crossed Andreev reflection in a minimal Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, exciting progress has been made in using the superconducting nanowires coupled to gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) to mimic the Kiteav chain and realize the Majorana-bound states via a poor man's route. The essential ingredient is to balance the interdot elastic-cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). As theoretically proposed, this can be mediated by the Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed in the superconducting nanowires. However, most of the gate-tuning asymmetric features observed in experiments can not be captured using the current theoretical models. To address this insufficiency, here, we consider a full model that explicitly includes all the details of both the QD states and the ABSs. Remarkable agreement is found with the recent experimental observations, where our model correctly reveals the gate-tuning asymmetry in ECTs and by which the average QD state energy can also be extracted. In contrast, CARs do not depend on the tuning of QD states. Moreover, armed with the tunability of ECTs and CARs with QD states, we also predict a controllable anisotropic superexchange interaction between electron spins in the two separated QDs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of enhanced thermopower from emergent local moments in flatbands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, characteristic of Heavy-Fermion physics. Yet, these experiments lack direct evidence of the existence of local moments associated with the heavy electrons, a key component of Heavy-Fermion physics. Thermopower serves as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy and can, therefore, unveil the presence of local moments by assessing their impact on entropy. In this work, we have carried out comprehensive thermopower studies on MATBLG by varying temperatures ($T$) and magnetic fields ($B$). While the resistance exhibits prominent resistance peaks at integer fillings apart from the Dirac point (DP, $\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower remains featureless and symmetric to the DP with opposite signs, in complete violation of the Mott formula, even up to $\sim 100K$. This discrepancy indicates that resistance and thermopower are carried by different kinds of carriers. With the expected sign changes at the DP and full band filling, the thermopower demonstrates additional sign changes within the conduction and valence bands around $\nu \sim \pm 1$, persisting from $5K$ to $50K$. These observations cannot be explained solely by thermopower arising from an emergent Heavy-Fermion band picture, which is highly sensitive to temperature. Instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution coming from the entropy of the localized moments of heavy electrons. To validate the claim, we studied the thermopower with $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$, revealing a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, and attributed to the partial polarization of the local moments (spin/valley), resulting in decreased entropy. Our results highlight the thermopower contribution from local moments and establish the Heavy-Fermion physics in MATBLG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum skyrmions under a magnetic field gradient using neural network quantum states. First, we obtain a quantum skyrmion lattice ground state using variational Monte Carlo with a restricted Boltzmann machine as the variational ansatz for a quantum Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Then, using the time-dependent variational principle, we study the real-time evolution of quantum skyrmions after a Hamiltonian quench with an inhomogeneous external magnetic field. We show that field gradients are an effective way of manipulating and moving quantum skyrmions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that quantum skyrmions can decay when interacting with each other. This work shows that neural network quantum states offer a promising way of studying the real-time evolution of quantum magnetic systems that are outside the realm of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cobalt disilicide provides a promising nearly-epitaxial superconducting material on silicon, which is compatible with high-density integrated circuit technology. We have characterized CoSi$_{2}$ superconducting microwave cavities around 5.5 GHz for resonance frequency fluctuations at temperatures 10 - 200 mK. We found relatively weak fluctuations $(\delta f/f)^2$ following the spectral density $A/f^{\gamma} $, with $A \simeq 6 \times 10^{-16}$ and $\gamma$ slightly below 1 at an average number of photons of $10^4$; the noise decreased with measurement power as $1/P^{1/2}$. We identify the noise as arising from kinetic inductance fluctuations and discuss possible origins of such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

Abstract: The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are dominated by localized surface plasmons (LSPs). Their properties only depend on the constituting material, the size and shape of the nano-object as well as its surrounding medium. In anisotropic structures, such as metallic nanorods, two families of modes generally exist, transverse and longitudinal. Their spectral and spatial overlaps usually impede their separate measurements in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this work, we propose three different strategies enabling to overcome this difficulty and selectively probe longitudinal and transverse modes. The first strategy is numeric and relies on morphing of nano-structures, rooted in the geometrical nature of LSPs. The two other strategies exploit the relativistic and wave nature of the electrons in an EELS experiment. The first one is the phase-matching between the electron and the plasmon excitation to enhance their coupling by either tilting the sample and modifying the electron kinetic energy. The second one - polarized EELS (pEELS) - exploits the wave nature of electrons to mimic selection rules analogous to the one existing in light spectroscopies. The above-mentioned strategies are exemplified - either experimentally or numerically - on a canonical plasmonic toy model: the nano-rod. The goal of the paper is to bring together the state-of-the-art concepts of EELS for plasmonics to tackle a pedestrian problem in this field.</description>

      <title>An optically defined phononic crystal defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phononic crystal with a defect mode defined and controlled entirely by optical forces. By applying a strong optical trap to a single unit cell of a Si$_3$N$_4$ phononic crystal membrane, we coherently couple many modes to each other, and smoothly transfer a single defect mode into the phononic bandgap. This is accompanied by localization of the mode's spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within just a few unit cells, as evidenced by a 37-fold reduction in the participating mass. This proof-of-concept coupling between light and mechanical mode shape significantly broadens the optomechanical design space. It also demonstrates the feasibility of optically programmable lattice potentials, enabling (in addition to defects) reconfigurable waveguides, superlattices, and disorder, with corresponding avenues of research toward creating unique states of macroscopic quantum motion.</description>

      <title>On the geometric phase and its role in the design of elastic topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the occurrence and evolution of the dynamic response in a diverse spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of the concept of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the study of the geometric phase. This study reviews the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its role in the design of elastic materials. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on a proper geometric design of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Driving non-trivial quantum phases in conventional semiconductors with intense excitonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing novel quantum phases and topologies in materials using intense light fields is a key objective of modern condensed matter physics, but nonetheless faces significant experimental challenges. Alternately, theory predicts that in the dense limit, excitons - collective excitations composed of Coulomb-bound electron-hole pairs - could also drive exotic quantum phenomena. However, the direct observation of these phenomena requires the resolution of electronic structure in momentum space in the presence of excitons, which became possible only recently. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of an atomically thin semiconductor in the presence of a high-density of resonantly and coherently photoexcited excitons, we observe the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) excitonic state - analogous to the Cooper pairs of superconductivity. We see the valence band transform from a conventional paraboloid into a Mexican-hat like Bogoliubov dispersion - a hallmark of the excitonic insulator phase; and we observe the recently predicted giant exciton-driven Floquet effects. Our work realizes the promise that intense bosonic fields, other than photons, can also drive novel quantum phenomena and phases in materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of thin-film heterostructures is generally considered the most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and electronic quality between three-dimensional materials. However, these interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching symmetries and lattice constants. We present a novel category of interfaces, the fabrication of which is membrane-based and does not require epitaxial growth. These interfaces therefore overcome limitations imposed by epitaxy. Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, we demonstrate atomically clean interfaces between three-fold symmetric sapphire and four-fold symmetric SrTiO3. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals structurally well-defined interfaces with a novel moir\'e-type reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: Many are the ways of engineering the band gap of nanoribbons including application of stress, electric field and functionalization of the edges. In this article, we investigate separately the effects of these methods on armchair graphene and boron nitride nanoribbons. By means of density functional theory calculations, we show that, despite their similar structure, the two materials respond in opposite ways to these stimuli. By treating them as perturbations of a heteroatomic ladder model based on the tight-binding formalism, we connect the two behaviours to the different symmetries of the top valence and bottom conduction wave functions. These results indicate that opposite and complementary strategies are preferable to engineer the gapwidth of armchair graphene and boron nitride nanoribbons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Support-based transfer and contacting of individual nanomaterials for in-situ nanoscale investigations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of nanomaterials has been gaining importance in recent years, difficulties in sample preparation have limited the number of studies on electrical properties. Here, a support-based preparation method of individual 1D and 2D materials is presented, which yields a reproducible sample transfer for electrical investigation by in-situ TEM. Using a mechanically rigid support grid allows the reproducible transfer and contacting to in-situ chips by focused ion beam with minimum damage and contamination. The transfer quality is assessed by exemplary studies of different nanomaterials, including a monolayer of WS2. Preliminary results from in-situ test experiments give an overview of possible studies, which concern the interplay between structural properties and electrical characteristics on the individual nanomaterial level as well as failure analysis under electrical current or studies of electromigration, Joule heating and related effects. The TEM measurements can be enriched by additional correlative microscopy techniques, which allow the study with a spatial resolution in the range of a few microns. Although developed for in-situ TEM, the present transfer method is also applicable to transferring nanomaterials to similar chips for performing further studies or even for using them in potential electrical/optoelectronic/sensing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density density correlation function (most singular parts) of chiral Luttinger liquids forming the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) edge is systematically derived in presence of a point-contact junction acting as a localised scalar impurity and is shown to be expressible as compact analytical functions with second order poles and involving the bare scale-independent reflection and transmission coefficients. The results are validated on comparison with standard fermionic perturbation theory. The linear response Hall conductance in the absence of a point-contact is recovered from the obtained density density correlation functions (DDCF). The system under consideration is inhomogeneous with broken translational invariance and for such systems in one dimension, the connected moments of the density fluctuation operator beyond second order need not be included in order to retreive the most singular parts of the correlations. The reason being that all odd moments of the density are zero and all higher order even moments are less singular than the quadratic moment. The implications of these results when used in conjunction with bosonization methods in presence of impurity backscattering is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Layer Coherence Origin of Intrinsic Planar Hall Effect in 2D Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic planar Hall effect has attracted intensive interest inspired by recent experiments. Existing theories of this effect require three dimensional orbital motion, or strong spin-orbit coupling of certain forms, which do not exist in van der Waals thin films. Here, we uncover a new origin of the planar Hall effect - as an intrinsic property of layer coherent electrons - that allows its presence even in bilayer and trilayer atomically thin limit. As examples, we show that the effect can be triggered by strain and interlayer sliding respectively in twisted bilayer graphene and trilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where the effect features rich tunability and even stronger magnitude than those induced by topological nodal structures in bulk materials. The layer mechanism also provides a new route towards quantized Hall response upon a topological phase transition induced by in-plane magnetic field. These results unveil the unexplored potential of quantum layertronics and moir\'e flat band for planar Hall transport.</description>

Abstract: Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility, the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized chiral magnetic textures with particle-like properties have so far primarily been studied statically. Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of skyrmion ensembles in metallic thin film conduits where they behave as quasi-particle fluids. By exploiting our access to the full trajectories of all fluid particles by means of time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy, we demonstrate that boundary conditions of skyrmion fluids can be tuned by modulation of the channel geometry. We observe as a function of channel width deviations from classical flow profiles even into the no- or partial-slip regime. Unlike conventional colloids, the skyrmion Hall effect can also introduce transversal flow-asymmetries and even local motion of single skyrmions against the driving force which we explore with particle-based simulations, demonstrating the unique properties of skyrmion liquid flow that uniquely deviates from previously known behavior of other quasi-particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle is known to have a cascade of insulating phases at integer filling factors of the low-energy bands. In this Letter we address the nature of these phases through an unrestricted, large-scale Hartree-Fock calculation on the lattice that self-consistently accounts for all electronic bands. Using numerically unbiased methods, we show that Coulomb interactions produce ferromagnetic insulating states at integer fillings $\nu\in[-3,3]$ with maximal spin polarization $M_{\text{FM}}=4-|\nu|$. We find that the $\nu=0$ state is a pure ferromagnet, whereas all other insulating states are spin-valley polarized. At odd filling factors $|\nu|=1,3$ those states have a quantum anomalous Hall effect with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Except for the $\nu=0,-2$ states, all other integer fillings have insulating phases with additional sublattice symmetry breaking and antiferromagnetism in the remote bands. We map the metal-insulator transitions of these phases as a function of the effective dielectric constant. Our results establish the importance of large-scale lattice calculations to faithfully determine the ground states of TBG at integer fillings.</description>

      <title>Heat radiation and transfer for nanoparticles in the presence of a cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heat radiation and radiative heat transfer for nanoparticles in the presence of an infinitely long cylinder in different geometrical configurations, based on its electromagnetic Green's tensor. The heat radiation of a single particle can be enhanced by placing it close to a nanowire, and this enhancement can be much larger as compared to placing it close to a plate of the same material. The heat transfer along a cylinder decays much slower than through empty vacuum, being especially long-ranged in the case of a perfectly conducting nanowire, and showing nonmonotonic behavior in the case of a SiC cylinder. Exploring the dependence on the relative azimuthal angle of the nanoparticles, we find that the results are insensitive to small angles, but they can be drastically different when the angle is large, depending on the material. Finally, we demonstrate that a cylinder can either enhance or block the heat flux when placed perpendicular to the interparticle distance line, where the blocking in particular is strongly enhanced compared to the geometry of a sphere of same radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of multiferroic magnetoelectrics, combining simultaneous ferroelectric and magnetic orders, remains a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here we report the centrosymmetric, one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic WOI$_3$ undergoes a strain-induced ferroelectric distortion. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition is originated from the unconventional anisotropic $d^1$ mechanism, where an unpaired d electron of each W$^{5+}$ ion contributes to magnetic orders. Employing a Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict an antiferromagnetic spin configuration as the paraelectric ground state, transitioning to a ferroelectric phase with noncollinear spin arrangement under uniaxial strain. The ferroelectric polarization and noncollinear spin arrangement can be manipulated by varying the applied strain. While the energy barriers for switching ferroelectric polarizations with magnetic orders are on the order of a few dozen of meV, the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) exhibits remarkable differences, providing a precise and valuable tool for experimentally probing the interplay of ferroelectric and magnetic orders in 1D WOI$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the conditional measurement of field amplitudes by a nonclassical photon sequence in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under multiphoton operation. We do so by employing a correlator of immediate experimental relevance to reveal a distinct nonclassical evolution in the spirit of [G. T. Foster et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3149 (2000)]. The correlator relies on the complementary nature of the pictures obtained from different unravelings of a JC source master equation. We demonstrate that direct photodetection entails a conditioned separation of timescales, a quantum beat and a semiclassical oscillation, produced by the coherent light-matter interaction in its strong-coupling limit. We single the quantum beat out in the analytical expression for the waiting-time distribution, pertaining to the particle nature of the scattered light, and find a negative spectrum of quadrature amplitude squeezing, characteristic of its wave nature for certain operation settings. Finally, we jointly detect the dual aspects through the wave-particle correlator, showing an asymmetric regression of fluctuations to the steady state which depends on the quadrature amplitude being measured.</description>
