      <title>Generalised doubles and simple homotopy types of high dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the set of fundamental groups for which there exist $n$-manifolds that are $h$-cobordant (hence homotopy equivalent) but not simple homotopy equivalent, when $n$ is sufficiently large. In particular, for $n \ge 12$ even, we show that examples exist for any finitely presented group $G$ such that the involution on the Whitehead group $Wh(G)$ is nontrivial. This expands on previous work, where we constructed the first examples of even-dimensional manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent. Our construction is based on doubles of thickenings, and a key ingredient of the proof is a formula for the Whitehead torsion of a homotopy equivalence between such manifolds.</description>

      <title>From annular to toroidal pseudo knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the theory of planar pseudo knots to the theories of annular and toroidal pseudo knots. Pseudo knots are defined as equivalence classes under Reidemeister-like moves of knot diagrams characterized by crossings with undefined over/under information. In the theories of annular and toroidal pseudo knots we introduce their respective lifts to the solid and the thickened torus. Then, we interlink these theories by representing annular and toroidal pseudo knots as planar ${\rm O}$-mixed and ${\rm H}$-mixed pseudo links. We also explore the inclusion relations between planar, annular and toroidal pseudo knots, as well as of ${\rm O}$-mixed and ${\rm H}$-mixed pseudo links. Finally, we extend the planar weighted resolution set to annular and toroidal pseudo knots, defining new invariants for classifying pseudo knots and links in the solid and in the thickened torus.</description>

      <title>Patterns of the $V_2$-polynomial of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank 2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Knot Floer Homology.</description>

      <title>Knots Inside Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that all knots can be embedded into the Menger Sponge fractal. We prove that all Pretzel knots can be embedded into the Sierpinski Tetrahedron. Then we compare the number of iterations of each of these fractals needed to produce a given knot as a mean to compare the complexity of the two fractals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of Rasmussen's formulation of Khovanov-Rozansky homology originally given over $\mathbb{Q}$ in arXiv:math/0607544, we compare different flavors of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ link homology with the link invariants obtained by Kitchloo in arXiv:1910.07444 via twistings of Borel equivariant cohomology applied to the symmetry breaking spectra. In particular, we see how these geometric constructions based on Bott-Samelson varieties produce equivariant integral $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ link homology with either specialized or universal potential.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for hyperbolic string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an analog of Mirzakhani's recursion relation for hyperbolic string vertices and investigate its implications for closed string field theory. Central to our construction are systolic volumes: the Weil-Petersson volumes of regions in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces whose elements have systoles $L \geq 0$. These volumes can be shown to satisfy a recursion relation through a modification of Mirzakhani's recursion as long as $L \leq 2 \sinh^{-1} 1$. Applying the pants decomposition of Riemann surfaces to off-shell string amplitudes, we promote this recursion to hyperbolic string field theory and demonstrate the higher order vertices are determined by the cubic vertex iteratively for any background. Such structure implies the solutions of closed string field theory obey a quadratic integral equation. We illustrate the utility of our approach in an example of a stubbed scalar theory.</description>

      <title>A combination theorem for hierarchically quasiconvex subgroups, and application to geometric subgroups of mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for two subgroups of a hierarchically hyperbolic group to generate an amalgamated free product over their intersection. The result applies in particular to certain geometric subgroups of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, that is, those subgroups coming from the embeddings of closed subsurfaces.
  In the second half of the paper, we study under which hypotheses our amalgamation procedure preserves several notions of convexity in HHS, such as hierarchical quasiconvexity (as introduced by Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto) and strong quasiconvexity (every quasigeodesic with endpoints on the subset lies in a uniform neighbourhood). This answers a question of Russell, Spriano, and Tran.</description>

      <title>On the homology of big mapping class groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of the one-holed Cantor tree surface is acyclic. This in turn determines the homology of the mapping class group of the once-punctured Cantor tree surface (i.e. the plane minus a Cantor set), in particular answering a recent question of Calegari and Chen. We in fact prove these results for a general class of infinite-type surfaces called binary tree surfaces. To prove our results we use two main ingredients: one is a modification of an argument of Mather related to the notion of dissipated groups; the other is a general homological stability result for mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>On unknotting fibered positive knots and braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unknotting number $u$ and the genus $g$ of braid positive knots are equal, as shown by Rudolph. We prove the stronger statement that any positive braid diagram of a genus $g$ knot contains $g$ crossings, such that changing them produces a diagram of the trivial knot. Then, we turn to unknotting the more general class of fibered positive knots, for which $u = g$ was conjectured by Stoimenow. We prove that the known ways to unknot braid positive knots do not generalize to fibered positive knots. Namely, we prove that there are fibered positive knots that cannot be unknotted optimally along fibered positive knots; there are fibered positive knots that do not arise as trefoil plumbings; and there are positive diagrams of fibered positive knots of genus $g$ that do not contain $g$ crossings, such that changing them produces a diagram of the trivial knot. In fact, we conjecture that one of our examples is a counterexample to Stoimenow's conjecture.</description>

      <title>A K-theory spectrum for cobordism cut and paste groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cobordism groups and cut-and-paste groups of manifolds arise from imposing two different relations on the monoid of manifolds under disjoint union. By imposing both relations simultaneously, a cobordism cut and paste group $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}_n$ is defined. In this paper, we extend this definition to manifolds with boundary obtaining $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$ and study the relationship of this group to an appropriately defined cobordism group of manifolds with boundary. The main results are the construction of a spectrum that recovers on $\pi_0$ the cobordism cut and paste groups of manifolds with boundary, $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$, and a map of spectra that lifts the canonical quotient map $\mathrm{SK}^{\partial}_n \rightarrow \overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$.</description>
