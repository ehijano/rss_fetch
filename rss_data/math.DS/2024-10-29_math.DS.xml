      <title>Topological vortex identification for Hamiltonian flows in doubly periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of two-dimensional incompressible and viscous fluids in doubly periodic domains is often used as a numerical model to investigate the dynamics and statistical properties of two-dimensional (2d) turbulence. In the study of 2d turbulence, it is important to describe interactions of coherent vortex structures of various sizes in turbulent flows, but identifying such vortex structures accurately from complex flow patterns is not easy. In this paper, we provide a classification theory for the topological structure of particle orbits generated by two-dimensional Hamiltonian flows on a flat torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, which is a mathematical model of 2d incompressible and viscous flows. Based on this theory, we show that the global orbit structure of every Hamiltonian flow is converted into a planar tree, called {\it a partially Cyclically-Ordered rooted Tree (COT)}, and its string expression (COT representation). Applying the conversion algorithm to snapshots of two-dimensional free-decaying turbulence and enstrophy cascade turbulence, we demonstrate that the topological structure of a complex flow pattern can be represented by a simple tree and a sequence of letters by the conversion algorithm, thereby extracting coherent vortex structures successfully from the viewpoint of topology.</description>

      <title>Cubic Siegel polynomials and the bifurcation measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that cubic polynomial maps with a fixed Siegel disk and a critical orbit eventually landing inside that Siegel disk lie in the support of the bifurcation measure. This answers a question of Dujardin in positive.
  Our result implies the existence of holomorphic disks in the support of the bifurcation measure, and also implies that the set of rigid parameters is not closed in the moduli space of cubic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Topological entropy and Hausdorff dimension of shrinking target sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the topological entropy and the Hausdorff dimension of a shrinking target set. We give lower and upper bounds of topological entropy and Hausdorff dimension for dynamical systems with exponential specification property and Lipschitz continuity for maps and homeomorphisms. It generally applies to uniformly hyperbolic systems, expanding systems, and some symbolic dynamics. We show that lower and upper bounds coincide for both topological entropy and Hausdorff dimension when the systems are hyperbolic automorphisms of torus induced from a matrix with only two different eigenvalues, expanding endomorphism of the torus induced from a matrix with only one eigenvalue or some symbolic systems including one or two-sided shifts of finite type and sofic shifts.</description>

      <title>Deciphering culprits for cyanobacterial blooms and lake vulnerability in north-temperate lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) have a growing global prevalence, emerging as a significant environmental concern due to their potential toxicity. Understanding how the different mechanisms affect CBs is crucial to develop actionable management strategies. For this, we derive a stoichiometric dynamical system that describes the qualitative population dynamics of cyanobacteria and their toxicity in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and the effect of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a potent toxin produced by cyanobacteria, on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. By fitting the model to lakes with varying physical characteristics, eutrophic conditions, and water temperature, we can delineate and understand the driving components of CBs. We show that decreases in water exchange rate, depth of epilimnion, or light attenuation increases bloom intensity and duration. Furthermore, our models concur that eutrophication and increasing water temperatures exacerbate the intensity of CBs. We observe a severe bioaccumulative effect of MC-LR in aquatic species, stressing the potential impact on humans and other terrestrial animals. We validate our model with field measurements demonstrating its applicability to several realistic lake conditions. These insights are essential for informing targeted interventions to reduce CBs and their ecological impacts.</description>

      <title>Regularized determinant formulas for the zeta functions of 3-dimensional Riemannian foliated dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a regularized determinant formula for the zeta functions of certain 3-dimensional Riemannian foliated dynamical systems, in terms of the infinitesimal operator induced by the flow acting on the reduced leafwise cohomologies. It is the formula conjectured by Deninger. The proof is based on relating the dynamical spectral $\xi$-functions, analogues of the $\xi$-function in analytic number theory, with the zeta function, by applying the distributional dynamical Lefschetz trace formula.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for the n-dimensional real Jacobian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real Jacobian conjecture was posed by Randall in 1983. This conjecture asserts that if $F=\left(f_1,\ldots ,f_n\right):\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ is a polynomial map such that $\det DF\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\neq0$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$, then $F$ is injective.
  This investigation mainly consists of two parts. Firstly, we use the qualitative theory of dynamical systems to give an alternate proof of the polynomial version of the $n$-dimensional Hadamard's theorem. Secondly, we present some algebraic sufficient conditions for the $n$-dimensional real Jacobian conjecture. Our results not only extend the main result of [J. Differential Equations {\bf 260} (2016), 5250-5258] to quasi-homogeneous type, but also generalize it from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a coproduct of our proof process, we solve an open problem formulated by Braun, Gin\'{e} and Llibre in [J. Differential Equations {\bf 260} (2016), 5250-5258].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study normal forms of analytic saddle-nodes in $\mathbb C^n$ with any Poincar\'e rank $k\in \mathbb N$. The approach and the results generalize those of Bonchaert and De Maesschalck from 2008 that considered $k=1$. In particular, we introduce a Banach convolutional algebra that is tailored to study differential equations in the Borel plane of order $k$. We anticipate that our approach can stimulate new research and be used to study different normal forms in future work.</description>

      <title>Improved polynomial rates of memory loss for nonstationary intermittent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonstationary dynamical systems formed by sequential concatenation of nonuniformly expanding maps with a uniformly expanding first return map. Assuming a polynomially decaying upper bound on the tails of first return times that is nonuniform with respect to location in the sequence, we derive a corresponding sharp polynomial rate of memory loss. As applications, we obtain new estimates on the rate of memory loss for random ergodic compositions of Pomeau--Manneville type intermittent maps and intermittent maps with unbounded derivatives.</description>

      <title>Spiders' webs in the Eremenko-Lyubich class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the entire function $f(z)=\cosh(z)$. We show that the escaping set of this function - that is, the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity under iteration - has a structure known as a "spider's web". This disproves a conjecture of Sixsmith from 2020. In fact, we show that the "fast escaping set", i.e. the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity at an iterated exponential rate, is a spider's web. This answers a question of Rippon and Stallard from 2012. We also discuss a wider class of functions to which our results apply, and state some open questions.</description>

Abstract: We describe a family $\textrm{Cyc}_p(\mathcal{F})$ of marked cycle curves that parameterize the cycles of period $p$ of a given family $\mathcal{F}$ of dynamical systems. We produce algorithms to compute a canonical cell decomposition for the marked cycle curves over the family $\textrm{Per}_1(0)$ of quadratic polynomials as well as over the family $\textrm{Per}_2(0)$ of quadratic rational maps with a critical 2-cycle. We obtain formulas for the number of $d$-cells in these decompositions, giving rise to e.g. a formula for their genus.</description>

      <title>Studying network of symmetric periodic orbit families of the Hill problem via symplectic invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the spatial circular Hill three-body problem we illustrate the application of symplectic invariants to analyze the network structure of symmetric periodic orbit families. The extensive collection of families within this problem constitutes a complex network, fundamentally comprising the so-called basic families of periodic solutions, including the orbits of the satellite $g$, $f$, the libration (Lyapunov) $a,c$, and collision $\mathcal B_0$ families. Since the Conley-Zehnder index leads to a grading on the local Floer homology and its Euler characteristics, a bifurcation invariant, the computation of those indices facilitates the construction of well-organized bifurcation graphs depicting the interconnectedness among families of periodic solutions. The critical importance of the symmetries of periodic solutions in comprehending the interaction among these families is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The impact of a wind switch on the stability of traveling fronts in a reaction-diffusion model of fire propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain values of the wave speed parameter, evolution equations for the temperature of a region of fuel admit traveling wave solutions describing fire fronts. We consider such a system in the form of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation with a first-order forcing term capturing the combined effects of ambient and fire-induced wind. The fire-induced wind is introduced by way of a piecewise continuous function that ``switches'' in space. We demonstrate that, in the case of a spatially dependent wind, traveling wave solutions corresponding to fire fronts exist for a continuum of wave speeds rather than for a single unique speed. Using geometric methods, we determine the range of allowable speeds, refine this range to only those fronts which will persist in nature, and develop a selection mechanism to identify the specific wind configuration corresponding to the most stable solution. For this spectrally preferred front, we find that the wind switch occurs ahead of the fireline in a manner consistent with the physics of air entrainment. Even when the wind is not coupled to the temperature and is instead imposed as an external forcing, the conditions on the existence and stability of front solutions force the wind term in to a configuration reflective of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary Control of a Neuromorphic Network through a Mixed-Feedback Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles of computer engineering, electronics, and neuroscience, aiming to design hardware and software that can process information in a similar manner to biological brains, offering advantages in efficiency, adaptability, and cognitive capabilities. In this work, we propose a coevolutionary (or adaptive) mixed-feedback framework in which, mimicking a feedback control loop, a neuromorphic plant follows a predetermined desired rhythmic profile. This simple, yet efficient coevolutionary law adaptively minimizes the error between the responses of the reference and the plant through a node-to-node mapping. Such direct node correspondence ensures that each node in the plant is associated with a corresponding element in the reference, even in the presence of a discrepancy in the number of oscillators between the two networks. As a result, the controlled output of the plant effectively replicates the response of the reference in an orderly manner. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mixed-feedback control approach through several examples, including the amplitude and phase control when considering a plant and a reference with the same and different topologies on their associated networks, as well as the generation of complete synchrony by considering a single node reference. Additionally, we further test our control methodology by demonstrating its efficiency even in the presence of reference networks with a time-varying topology. Finally, we discuss future work for the development of similar coevolutionary laws that enable the control of networks which describe different dynamical systems, as well as higher-order topological dependencies.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystals in pattern formation, Part I: Local existence and basic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general mechanism for the existence of quasicrystals in spatially extended systems (partial differential equations with Euclidean symmetry). We argue that the existence of quasicrystals with higher order rotational symmetry, icosahedral symmetry, etc, is a natural and universal consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, bypassing technical issues such as Diophantine properties and hard implicit function theorems. The diffraction diagrams associated with these quasicrystal solutions are not Delone sets, so strictly speaking they do not conform to the definition of a ``mathematical quasicrystal''. But they do appear to capture very well the features of the diffraction diagrams of quasicrystals observed in nature. For the Swift-Hohenberg equation, we obtain more detailed information, including that the $\ell^2$ norm of the diffraction diagram grows like the square root of the bifurcation parameter.</description>

      <title>CGKN: A Deep Learning Framework for Modeling Complex Dynamical Systems and Efficient Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is widely used to predict complex dynamical systems in many scientific and engineering areas. However, the black-box nature of these deep learning models presents significant challenges for carrying out simultaneous data assimilation (DA), which is a crucial technique for state estimation, model identification, and reconstructing missing data. Integrating ensemble-based DA methods with nonlinear deep learning models is computationally expensive and may suffer from large sampling errors. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning framework designed to simultaneously provide accurate forecasts and efficient DA. It is named Conditional Gaussian Koopman Network (CGKN), which transforms general nonlinear systems into nonlinear neural differential equations with conditional Gaussian structures. CGKN aims to retain essential nonlinear components while applying systematic and minimal simplifications to facilitate the development of analytic formulae for nonlinear DA. This allows for seamless integration of DA performance into the deep learning training process, eliminating the need for empirical tuning as required in ensemble methods. CGKN compensates for structural simplifications by lifting the dimension of the system, which is motivated by Koopman theory. Nevertheless, CGKN exploits special nonlinear dynamics within the lifted space. This enables the model to capture extreme events and strong non-Gaussian features in joint and marginal distributions with appropriate uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CGKN for both prediction and DA on three strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian turbulent systems: the projected stochastic Burgers--Sivashinsky equation, the Lorenz 96 system, and the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation. The results justify the robustness and computational efficiency of CGKN.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Analysis of T-Product-based Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of data can be represented using third-order tensors, spanning applications in chemometrics, psychometrics, and image processing. However, traditional data-driven frameworks are not naturally equipped to process tensors without first unfolding or flattening the data, which can result in a loss of crucial higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for the data-driven analysis of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), where the system evolution is governed by the T-product between a third-order dynamic tensor and a third-order state tensor. In particular, we examine the data informativity of TPDSs concerning system identification, stability, controllability, and stabilizability and illustrate significant computational improvements over traditional approaches by leveraging the unique properties of the T-product. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Deep Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Modelling Nonlinear Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have shown promise in many domain applications. This paper proposes a novel deep reservoir computing framework, termed deep recurrent stochastic configuration network (DeepRSCN) for modelling nonlinear dynamic systems. DeepRSCNs are incrementally constructed, with all reservoir nodes directly linked to the final output. The random parameters are assigned in the light of a supervisory mechanism, ensuring the universal approximation property of the built model. The output weights are updated online using the projection algorithm to handle the unknown dynamics. Given a set of training samples, DeepRSCNs can quickly generate learning representations, which consist of random basis functions with cascaded input and readout weights. Experimental results over a time series prediction, a nonlinear system identification problem, and two industrial data predictive analyses demonstrate that the proposed DeepRSCN outperforms the single-layer network in terms of modelling efficiency, learning capability, and generalization performance.</description>

      <title>The Competive Spectral Radius of Families of Nonexpansive Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a new class of repeated zero-sum games in which the payoff is the escape rate of a switched dynamical system, where at every stage, the transition is given by a nonexpansive operator depending on the actions of both players. This generalizes to the two-player (and non-linear) case the notion of joint spectral radius of a family of matrices. We show that the value of this game does exist, and we characterize it in terms of an infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem. This provides a two-player analogue of Ma\~ne's lemma from ergodic control. This also extends to the two-player case results of Kohlberg and Neyman (1981), Karlsson (2001), and Vigeral and the second author (2012), concerning the asymptotic behavior of nonexpansive mappings. We discuss two special cases of this game: order preserving and positively homogeneous self-maps of a cone equipped with Funk's and Thompson's metrics, and groups of translations.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: Convexity Degeneracy of Flux Functions and Fine Properties of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. Our primary aim of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel formula for entropy solutions for this Cauchy problem, specifically tailored to the flux functions satisfying (1.3) which allow the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. This formulation serves as a generalization of the Lax--Oleinik formula that necessitates the flux function to possess uniform convexity. Furthermore, we explore several key applications of this new formula to analyze fine properties of entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem with flux functions allowing for convexity degeneracy and initial data only in $L^\infty$; these especially include: (i) Fine structures of entropy solutions, (ii) Global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions, and (iii) Asymptotic profiles of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$ in both the $L^\infty$-norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$-norm. Through these analyses, we provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) allowing the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. Moreover, the new solution formula is extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with initial data in $L^1_{{\rm loc}}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $C_{\theta}$ be a circular cone in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$,which apex is the origin and apex angle of the cone is $\theta\in \left(\pi/3, \pi\right)$. Let $M_\theta$ be the class of compact convex domains in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which have diameter one, contains the origin and are included in $C_{\theta}$. In this paper, we show that there is a unique compact convex domain with maximal volume and also we determine the shape of the above domain.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the convergence rate with respect to the Wasserstein distance in the invariance principle for sequential dynamical systems. We utilize and modify the techniques previously employed for stationary sequences to address our non-stationary case. Under certain assumptions, we can apply our result to a large class of dynamical systems, including sequential $\beta_n$-transformations, piecewise uniformly expanding maps with additive noise in one-dimensional and multidimensional case, and so on.</description>

Abstract: We establish complete characterizations of the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted composition operators on $C_0(X)$ spaces and on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces. As a consequence, we obtain simple characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on $c_0$ and on $\ell^p$ ($1 \leq p &lt; \infty$) that complement previously known results. We also investigate the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. As applications, we obtain characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on K\"othe sequence spaces depending only on the entries of the K\"othe matrix and the weights of the shift.</description>

      <title>Entropies and Poisson boundaries of random walks on groups with rapid decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group and $\mu$ a probability measure on $G$. We build a new framework to compute asymptotic quantities associated with the $\mu$-random walk on $G$, using methods from harmonic analysis on groups and Banach space theory, most notably the complex interpolation. It is shown that under mild conditions, the Lyapunov exponent of the $\mu$-random walk with respect to a weight $\omega$ on $G$ can be computed in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the spectral radius of $\mu$ in an ascending class of weighted group algebras, and we prove that for natural choices of $\omega$ and $\mu$, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. Also, we show that the Avez entropy of the $\mu$-random walk can be realized as the Lyapunov exponent of $\mu$ with respect to a suitable weight.
  Next, by considering the spectral radius in the algebras of $p$-pseudofunctions on $G$, we introduce a new asymptotic quantity, which we call convolution entropy. We show that for groups with the property of rapid decay, the convolution entropy coincides with the Avez entropy. Subsequently, we apply our results to stationary dynamical systems consisting of an action of a group with the property of rapid decay on a probability space. We prove that whenever the associated Koopman representation is weakly contained in the left-regular representation of the group, then the Avez entropy coincides with the Furstenberg entropy of the stationary space. This gives a characterization of (Zimmer) amenability for actions of rapid decay groups on stationary spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamical entropy of probability measures on infinite product spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to introduce a notion of dynamical entropy, which we call infinite-product entropy, for probability measures on (countable) infinite cartesian product of any measurable space with itself. The idea behind the definition is that any infinite product space may be considered as a type of dynamical object. We have considered in a previous note a similar idea in topological dynamics to define a notion of dynamical entropy for arbitrary subsets of infinite products of compact topological spaces. We consider some basic properties of infinite-product entropy, e.g. shift invariance, convexity, subadditivity with respect to product of probability measures, the behavior with respect to dilation and restriction. We show that for a translation invariant probability measure the infinite-product entropy coincides with the usual entropy of a shift transformation. We consider some basic examples and computations. We also consider a variational inequality related to infinite-product entropy and topological entropy of subsets of infinite product spaces.</description>

Abstract: We show that a dynamical sequence $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of polynomials over a number field whose set of stable primes is of positive density must necessarily have a very restricted, and in particular ``near-solvable" dynamical Galois group. Together with existing heuristics, our results suggest moreover that a polynomial $f$ all of whose iterates are irreducible modulo a positive density subset of the primes must necessarily be a composition of linear functions, monomials and Dickson polynomials.</description>

      <title>Shape differentiation for Poincare maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Poincare maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains using a shape variational approach. Given a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$, we define its harmonic fields as the set of magnetic fields which are curl free and tangent to the boundary. For toroidal domains, this space is one dimensional, and one may thus single out a harmonic field by specifying a degree of freedom, such as the circulation along a toroidal loop. We are then interested in the Poincare maps of such fields restricted to the boundary, which produce diffeomorphisms of the circle. We begin by proving a general shape differentiability result of such Poincare maps in the smooth category, and obtain a general formula for the shape derivative. We then investigate two specific examples of interest; axisymmetric domains, and domains for which the harmonic field has a diophantine rotation number on the boundary. We prove that, in the first case, the shape derivative of the Poincare map is always identically zero, whereas in the second case, assuming an additional condition on the geometry of the domain, the shape derivative of the Poincare map may be any smooth function of the circle by choosing an appropriate perturbation of the domain.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al., 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al., 2021] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al., 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

Abstract: We study the projection of the left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the 3D Heisenberg group $G$ to the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold $M$ -- the compact homogeneous space of $G$ by the discrete Heisenberg group.
  First we describe dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for $M$: periodic and dense orbits, and a dynamical characterization of the normal Hamiltonian flow of Pontryagin maximum principle. Then we obtain sharp twoside bounds of sub-Riemannian balls and distance in $G$, and on this basis we estimate the cut time for sub-Riemannian geodesics in $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of the topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M, \tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace-preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (A, \tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, any $\Gamma$-invariant amenable intermediate subalgebra between $A$ and $\Gamma \ltimes A$ is necessarily a subalgebra of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma) \ltimes A$. By taking $(A, \tau_A) = L^\infty(X, \nu_X)$ for a free pmp action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (X, \nu_X)$, we obtain a similar result for the invariant subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>
