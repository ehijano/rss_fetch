      <title>Gr\"obner bases of Burchnall-Chaundy ideals for ordinary differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators (ODOs) and algebraic curves was established by Burchnall and Chaundy, Krichever and Mumford, among many others. To make this correspondence computationally effective, in this paper we aim to compute the defining ideals of spectral curves, Burchnall-Chaundy (BC) ideals. We provide an algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis of a BC ideal. The point of departure is the computation of the finite set of generators of a maximal commutative ring of ODOs, which was implemented by the authors in the package dalgebra of SageMath. The algorithm to compute BC ideals has been also implemented in dalgebra.
  The differential Galois theory of the corresponding spectral problems, linear differential equations with parameters, would benefit from the computation on this prime ideal, generated by constant coefficient polynomials. In particular, we prove the primality of the differential ideal generated by a BC ideal, after extending the coefficient field. This is a fundamental result to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems.</description>

      <title>The Milnor Number of One Dimensional Local Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analogue of the Milnor number for one dimensional local ring, and we show that it satisfies analogous properties to those of the Milnor number of plane curves over a field. In addition, we present two analogues of the semi-group of values for a one dimensional ring and show how they relate to our Milnor number. Finally, we use these tools and techniques to show we can relate these semigroups of one dimensional rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type to those of the classical ADE singularities.</description>

      <title>Independence Polynomials of graphs and degree of $h$-polynomials of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a finite simple graph. In this paper, we characterize the degree of the $h$-polynomial of the edge ideal of $G$ in terms of the independence number of $G$. The key tools are the value of the independence polynomial of $G$ at $-1$ and its derivative. Using this approach, we obtain, in particular, combinatorial formulas for the degree of the $h$-polynomial of paths, cycles, bipartite graphs, Cameron-Walker graphs and antiregular graphs.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified theory for common affine roots of general sets of multivariate polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For univariate polynomials over arbitrary field the degree gives an upper bound on the number of roots (factor theorem) and as a related result for any finite point-set one can construct a polynomial of degree equal to the cardinality having all the points as roots (interpolation theorem). Tao noted in [44] that the theory of multivariate polynomials is not yet sufficiently matured to provide similar theorems with an equally simple relation between them. In the present paper we argue that for general multivariate polynomials the right measure for the size of the polynomial should not be the degree, but the leading monomial. In this setting the footprint bound [25] becomes a natural enhancement of the factor theorem providing a bound on the number of common roots of general multivariate polynomials which is sharp for all finite Cartesian product point-sets. As our main contribution, by using methods from the theory of error-correcting codes we establish a natural formulation of the interpolation theorem to the case of common roots of multivariate polynomials. In short the two theorems reduce to the same result, but for dual spaces, establishing the unification requested in [44]. We leave it for further research to possibly establish similar interpolation results taking one or more of the various concepts of multiplicity of multivariate polynomials into account.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra. In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras. As a byproduct, we prove that, unlike the complexification, the cohomology ring of the complement of a $3$-plexification of a real arrangement is not determined by the intersection lattice.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>Torsor and Quotient Presentations for $D$-homogeneous Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $D$-graded Proj construction provides a general framework for constructing schemes from rings graded by finitely generated abelian groups $D$, yet its properties and applications remain underdeveloped compared to the classical $\mathbb{N}$-graded case. This paper establishes the essential characteristics of $D$-graded rings $S$, like the distinction between $D$-homogeneous prime ideals and $D$-prime ideals if $D$ has torsion. We particularly focus on describing the quotient by the associated group scheme, generalizing the construction of a toric variety from its Cox ring. As in the $\mathbb{N}$-graded construction, the basic affine opens of the Proj construction are given in terms of degree-zero localizations $S_{(f)}$, where $f$ in $S$ homogeneous is \emph{relevant}. We prove that $\pi_f: {\rm Spec}(S_f) \to {\rm Spec}(S_{(f)})$ is a geometric quotient under mild finiteness assumptions if $f$ is relevant, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for this map to be a pseudo ${\rm Spec}(S_0[D])$-torsor.</description>
