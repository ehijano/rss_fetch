      <title>Magnetic resonance in quantum computing and in accurate measurements of the nuclear moments of atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern experimental techniques can generate magnetic fields of the form H(t) = H0 z-hat + H1 [x-hat cos({\omega}t) + y-hat sin({\omega}t)], at frequencies within an order of magnitude of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequencies, {\omega}n0 and {\omega}e0, respectively, when acting on atoms or molecules. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the exact nuclear- and electronic-spin wave functions that enable controlled transitions between entangled states, allowing an atom or molecule to function as a quantum computer. These solutions also enable precise NMR or EPR measurements of nuclear moments in atoms and molecules. We present examples relevant to measurements of the nuclear moments of 14N, 7Li, and 133Cs. Because existing hyperfine measurements of the lowest three nuclear moments of 133Cs are mutually inconsistent, the proposed NMR/EPR experiments provide a route to measuring all seven of its nuclear moments with high precision.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical spectra from Rydberg-mediated photon-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Rydberg-Rydberg interactions are essential for quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information processing, their role in microwave and radio-frequency sensing remains poorly understood. Here we experimentally investigate Rydberg interaction-induced nonlinearity in cold-atom Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In a three-level EIT system, increasing photon-photon interactions produces nonlinear spectral broadening accompanied by resonance shifts, while a microwave-dressed four-level system exhibits pronounced nonlinear broadening without detectable spectral shifts. Our three-level data can be explained by a conditional superatom model, whereas our four-level observations are surprisingly captured by a simple dephasing model. Comparisons with three representative models provide key insights to the role of many-body interactions in Rydberg EIT spectroscopy. Furthermore, our results clarify the conditions under which microwave field characterization can be performed in the nonlinear regime without introducing systematic bias. Our study advances both fundamental understanding of many-body physics and practical development of atomic sensors.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Phase in Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a synthetic gauge phase in Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) using room-temperature rubidium vapor. By exploiting polarization selection rules in a ladder-type system involving ground, intermediate, and Rydberg states, multiple Zeeman sublevels form closed-loop transitions that acquire a gauge phase. We show that the relative polarization angle between the linearly polarized probe and coupling lasers directly controls this gauge phase, which modulates the EIT transmission and Rydberg state population, consequently controlling the linewidth of EIT due to Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions between atoms. Our approach provides a simple polarization-based method for realizing synthetic gauge physics and manipulating many-body interactions in atomic ensembles without requiring laser cooling and dipole traps.</description>

      <title>Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</description>

      <title>Protocols for a many-body phase microscope: From coherences and d-wave superconductivity to Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Realization of a cavity-coupled Rydberg array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control.</description>

      <title>Second excited state of ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ tetramer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.</description>

      <title>Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse in Correlated Matter-Wave Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating matter-wave interferometers as quantum detectors for fundamental physics or inertial sensors in real-world applications with unprecedented accuracies relies on noise rejection, often implemented by correlating two sensors. Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Photodetachment energy of negative hydrogen ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a high-precision calculation of the photodetachment energy of the hydrogen anion H$^{-}$, also known as the electron affinity of the hydrogen atom. The nonrelativistic bound-state energy is obtained using an exact three-body approach, and supplemented by leading relativistic, quantum-electrodynamic, finite-nuclear-size, and hyperfine corrections. Our result is $6083.06447(68)$ cm$^{-1}$ for the detachment to the hydrogen ground-state hyperfine level $(F=0)$, which is 220 times more precise than the best experimental determination to date, $6082.99(15)$ cm$^{-1}$, as reported by Lykke et al. Beyond their intrinsic interest, these results provide critical input for antihydrogen physics, where controlled photodetachment of $\bar{H}^{+}$ offers a path to producing ultracold antihydrogen (and its isotopes) for precision experiments. We further determine the photodetachment thresholds for $^{2}$H$^{-}$ and $^{3}$H$^{-}$ into the ground hyperfine states of the corresponding hydrogenic atoms, yielding $6086.70679(68)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $^{2}$H$(F=1/2)$ and $6087.87924(68)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $^{3}$H$(F=0)$.</description>

      <title>A narrow-linewidth Brillouin laser for a two-photon rubidium frequency standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High precision portable and deployable frequency standards are required for modern navigation and communication technologies. Optical frequency standards are attractive for their improved stability over their microwave counterparts; however, increased complexities have anchored them in the laboratory. Sacrificing sensitivity of the most stable optical clocks has led to the recent development of deployable and portable optical frequency standards, leveraging hot atomic or molecular vapor. The short term limit for a majority of previous reports on two-photon rubidium standards is either the shot-noise or intermodulation limit hindering the one second fractional frequency stability to around $1\times10^{-13}/\sqrt{\tau}$. The answer for the shot-noise limit is to increase optical power and collected fluorescence, while the intermodulation limit solution requires improvements in laser linewidth, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers are known to reduce frequency noise, suppressing noise of the pump laser at high offset frequencies. We investigate an optical frequency standard based on the two-photon transition in $^{87}$Rb probed with a narrow linewidth photonic integrated circuit SBS laser with a quality factor over 130 million and instantaneous linewidth $&lt;$ 10 Hz. The use of a narrow linewidth clock laser coupled with operating at higher optical intensities yields clock instabilities of $2\times10^{-14}$ at one second, currently the best reported short-term stability for a two-photon rubidium optical frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. Our framework unifies examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.</description>
