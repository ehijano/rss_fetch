      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter (D. Nakamura et al., arXiv:2407.09458), we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons in a collinear altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model with Weyl magnons and weak topological magnons ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) in a collinear altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice. Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Besides the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the band topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon Nernst effect for both the strong and weak topological phases when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. Furthermore, we find the orbital angular momentum induced purely by the topology of magnons, which can be probed by the Einstein-de Haas effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz lies at the juncture between RF and optical electromagnetism, serving as a transition from mm-Wave to infrared photonics. Terahertz technology has been used for industrial quality control, security imaging, and high-speed communications, and often generated through optoelectronic solutions by using photoconductive antennas. In this paper, Multiphysics simulations on semi insulating GaAs, grapheneenhanced photoconductive antennas are conducted to effectively decouple optical responses of semiconductor carrier generation/drift from Terahertz radiation computation, which provides a comprehensive and integrated platform for future terahertz photoconductive antenna designs</description>

      <title>Diverging shift current responses in the gapless limit of two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift current responses of two-dimensional systems in the gapless limit are investigated. As the energy gap becomes smaller, the interband transition probability becomes larger at the band edges. We found the divergence of the shift current response in a manner proportional to the inverse of the gap size when the system becomes a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal in the gapless limit. This behavior is different from that for electric polarization, which has a jump across the gapless case. It means that the quantitative relationship between electric polarizations and shift currents is broken in this gapless limit.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Ballistic Majorana Nanowire Devices" by Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work re-analyzes Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018 "Ballistic Majorana nanowire devices" using fuller data from the original experiments released in 2023 on Zenodo. The authors have prepared a correction to their article that appeared in Nature Nanotechnology in 2024. However, the correction does not address the concerns we identify here. We demonstrate that the fuller data contain extensive evidence for quantum dots and disorder that are completely inconsistent with the authors' conclusion that they have achieved ballistic devices containing zero bias peaks of likely Majorana origin. We show how data selection, data cropping and undisclosed data processing played a role in composing the figures of the final published paper.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a metallic sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the experiment and theory by M. Liu \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021), where a non-local and lossless model for the graphene conductivity (GC) has been used and shown to be compatible with the experimental results. Recently, that conductivity model has been shown to be not correctly regularized [arXiv:2403.02279], to predict nonphysical results in the non-local regime, and being correct only in its local limit, where its expression is identical to the local Kubo conductivity model (once also losses are introduced). To compare the experimental results with the correctly regularized Kubo theory and to clarify the effective role played by the graphene non-locality and losses in that experiment, we calculated the CLF using three different models for the GC: the correct general non-local Kubo model, the local Kubo model, and the non-regularized and lossless model used by M. Liu \emph{et al.}. For the parameters of the experiment, the predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical, implying that, for the experiment, both non-local and lossy effects in the GC are negligible. This explains why the GC model used in M. Liu \emph{et al.} provides results in agreement with the experiment. We find that the experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions. Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Behavior in the Boundary-obstructed Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator when the system is slowly quenched across the boundary-obstructed phase transition, which is characterized by edge band gap closing.
  We find that the number of excitations produced after the quench exhibits power-law scaling behaviors with the quench rate. Boundary conditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be $\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\alpha=2$ for periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\alpha=1/2$ cannot be explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective dimension $d^{\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison, we also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase transitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with dimension $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Study of Topological Phenomena Through Berry Phase in Classical Nonlinear Elastic Granules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric of Berry phase concept, traditionally rooted in quantum mechanics, has been found to be increasingly significant in classical mechanics, particularly for understanding the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. In this study, we demonstrate the controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a classical system using a two-level time-dependent elastic bit, analogous to a quantum bit, within a nonlinear environment generated by a two-granular network. The nonlinearity of the granular beads is modulated through the frequency and amplitude of external harmonic excitation, along with static preloading. By employing the orthonormal basis of the nonlinear responses and mapping the displacement coefficients in Bloch states, we reveal how time influences the manipulation of the elastic bit and its states. Our analytical and experimental investigations uncover the Berry phase's role in exposing the various topological characteristics of the classical granular network. This research establishes a crucial link between classical and quantum realms via the Berry phase of an elastic bit, with significant implications for decoherence-free and robust data transfer and information processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rashba Magnetism in Ultrathin Ferromagnet-Heavy Metal Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry lift the spin degeneracy of electronic bands, but the consequences of interplay between these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that ultrathin transition ferromagnet-heavy metal bilayers exhibit anomalous temperature- and electric bias-dependent behaviors in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, inconsistent with the usual Weiss magnetism. Characterization by several complementary techniques and analysis of the dependence on composition reveal that these effects originate from interfacial spin-orbit interaction, which results in the emergence of a state with distinct magnetic and magnetoelectronic properties that can be described as Rashba magnetism. Our findings open a new route for the characterization and control of spin-orbit phenomena in heterostructures enabling the development of efficient spin-orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Conduction band resonant states absorption for quantum dot infrared detectors operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long Wavelenght infrared devices, despite growing interest due to a wide range of applications in commercial, public, and academic sectors, are still struggling to achieve significant improvements over well-established technologies like HgCdTe detectors. Devices based on quantum nanostructures remain non competitive due to unresolved drawbacks, the most significant being the need to cool down to liquid nitrogen temperatures to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative solution to surpass the current generation of quantum dot-based detectors by exploiting the absorption from quantum dot localized states to resonant states in the continuum, that is states in the semiconductor conduction band with an enhanced probability density in the quantum dot region. This unprecedented approach takes advantage of the unique properties of such states to massively enhance carrier extraction, allowing to overcome one of the most crucial drawbacks of quantum dot-based infrared detectors. This innovative solution is discussed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The measured room temperature operation with high detectivity demonstrates that exploiting resonant states absorption in quantum dots offers the long-sought solution for the next generation of infrared photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of giant second harmonic generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) hold promise for future on-chip nonlinear optics. Relevant materials with both giant SHG response and environmental stability are long-sought targets. Here, we demonstrate the enormous SHG from the phase engineering of a high-performance semiconductor, Bi$_2$O$_2$Se (BOS), under uniaxial strain. SHG signals captured in strained 20 nm-BOS films exceed those of NbOI$_2$ and NbOCl$_2$ of similar thickness by a factor of 10, and are four orders of magnitude higher than monolayer-MoS$_2$, resulting in a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility on the order of 1 nm V$^{-1}$. Intriguingly, the strain enables continuous adjustment of the ferroelectric phase transition across room temperature. Consequently, an exceptionally large tunability of SHG, approximately six orders of magnitude, is achieved through strain or thermal modulation. This colossal SHG, originating from the geometric phase of Bloch wave functions and coupled with sensitive tunability through multiple approaches in this air-stable 2D semiconductor, opens new possibilities for designing chip-scale, switchable nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Non-chiral non-Bloch invariants and topological phase diagram in non-unitary quantum dynamics without chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Bloch topology leads to the emergence of various counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems under the open boundary condition (OBC), which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here by introducing the concept of non-chiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker's displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries and the non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in driven periodic systems: from weak to strong damping regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force of a moderate frequency. The study is focused on the dependence of its diffusion coefficient $D$ on the damping $\gamma$ ranging from the weak to strong one. We reveal the mechanisms of counterintutive effects in which diffusion can increase despite the grow of friction and exhibits both minima and maxima. Their origin is explained by analysis of the deterministic dynamics perturbed by thermal fluctuations. In the weak damping regime the maximum of diffusion is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits when the friction increases. In the strong dissipation regime the effect is caused by bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating symmetrically around the potential maximum and their displacement towards the potential minimum when the damping coefficient increases. It induces the change of the effective barrier of the periodic potential and its vanishing at the maximum of $D$.</description>

      <title>Experimentally mapping the scattering phases and amplitudes of a finite object by optical mutual scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual scattering arises when multiple waves intersect within a finite scattering object, resulting in cross-interference between the incident and scattered waves. By measuring mutual scattering, we determine the complex-valued scattering amplitude $f$ - both amplitude and phase - of the finite object, which holds information on its scattering properties by linking incident and outgoing waves from any arbitrary direction. Mutual scattering is present for any coherent wave - acoustic, electromagnetic, particle - and we here demonstrate the effect using optical experiments. We propose an experimental technique for characterization that utilizes mutual scattering and we present our results for four distinct finite objects: a polystyrene sphere (diameter $59\ \mu$m), a single black human hair (diameter $92\ \mu$m), a strip of pultruded carbon (edge length $140\ \mu$m), and a block of ZnO$_2$ (edge length $64\ \mu$m). Our measurements exhibit qualitative agreement with Mie scattering calculations where the model is applicable. Deviations from the model indicate the complexity of the objects, both in terms of their geometrical structure and scattering properties. Our results offer new insights into mutual scattering and have significant implications for future applications of sample characterization in fields such as metrology, microscopy, and nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>

Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Corner and Edge States in Topological Sierpinski Carpet Systems</title>

Abstract: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in novel ways. Here we present a theoretical discussion on localized corner and edge states, as well as electronic properties emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological hopping parameter phase diagram is constructed from which different spatial localized states are identified following signatures of distinct fractal generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge states that carrier the details of the Sierpinski Carpet topology.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium quantum heat transport between structured environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the $\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties of thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Robustness of type-II Dirac cones in biphenylene-based structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic properties of one- and two-dimensional biphenylene-based systems, such as nanoribbons and bilayers, are studied within a unified approach. Besides the bilayer with direct (AA) stacking, we present two additional symmetric stackings for bilayer biphenylene that we denote by AB, by analogy with bilayer graphene, and AX, which can be derived by a small translation (slip) from the AA bilayer, with distinct band structures. We combine first-principles calculations with a tight-binding model to provide a realistic effective description of these structures. Our approach provides a global framework to characterize and analyze the robustness of the type-II Dirac cone within these structures, captures the variations caused by different stackings, and highlights important symmetries inherent in the biphenylene nanoribbon Dirac cones and edge states.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <title>Going beyond Landauer scattering theory to describe spatially-resolved non-local heating and cooling in quantum thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially-resolved heating and cooling in nanostructures is nowadays measured with various nanoscale thermometry techniques, including scanning thermometry. Yet the most commonly used theory of nanoscale heating and thermoelectricity -- Landauer scattering theory -- is not appropriate to model such measurements. Hence, we analyze a minimal model of spatially-resolved heat transfer between electrons and phonons in simple thermoelectric nanostructures. This combines Landauer scattering formalism with a Boltzmann equation for transport, revealing the non-locality of Joule heating and Peltier cooling induced by a scatterer in a nanowire. The corresponding heating or cooling of the phonons is caused by the voltage drop at the scatterer, but is often maximal at a certain distance from the scatterer. This distance is of the order of the electron-phonon scattering length. Scanning thermal microscopy, such as SQUID-on-tip thermometers, should detect this non-locality as phonon hot spots and cold spots, spatially separated from the scatterer. We provide physical arguments explaining the thermoelectric response of the combined system of wire and scatterer, and in particular, why the resulting heating and cooling is sometimes the opposite to that predicted by the standard Landauer scattering theory.</description>

      <title>De Haas-van Alphen effect and quantum oscillations as a function of temperature in correlated insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study a model of excitonic insulators which show de Haas-van Alphen oscillations as well as periodic dependence of the magnetization on inverse temperature. The insulating behavior is due to the Coulomb interaction driven hybridization of fermions at the crossing point of their energy bands. We study this hybridization self-consistently and recover known results by A. Allocca and N. Cooper, SciPost Phys. {\bf 12}, 123 (2022). In addition to known results, we show that the hybridization gap decreases with the magnetic field which corresponds to the diamagnetism. Furthermore, we show that the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen is oscillating with inverse temperature with a period defined by a combination of the hybridization gap and magnetic field. We analytically obtain the position and the height of the first and dominant peak of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called \textit{Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase} of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Correlated states controlled by tunable van Hove singularity in moir\'e WSe2</title>

Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors have enabled the discovery of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, correlated insulators and a series of new topological phases of matter. However, the connection between these electronic phases and the underlying band structure singularities in these materials has remained largely unexplored. Here, combining the magnetic circular dichroism and electronic compressibility measurements, we investigate the influence of a van Hove singularity on the correlated phases in bilayer WSe2 with twist angle between 2-3 degrees. We demonstrate stabilizing the Stoner ferromagnetism below moir\'e lattice filling one and Chern insulators at filling one by tuning the van Hove singularity cross the Fermi level using the electric and magnetic fields. The experimental observations are supported by the continuum model band structure calculations. Our results highlight the prospect of engineering the electronic phases by tunable van Hove singularities.</description>
