      <title>Capturing anharmonic effects in single vibronic level fluorescence spectra using local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra from any initial vibrational level in displaced, squeezed, and Duschinsky-rotated global harmonic models. Real molecules, however, have anharmonic potential energy surfaces. To partially describe effects of anharmonicity on the spectra, we combine the Hagedorn approach to spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation of the potential. We compute the SVL spectra for several anharmonic Morse-type potentials in one, two, and twenty dimensions and compare them to the results of global harmonic approximations and, where possible, of exact quantum calculations. We show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Chemical Data Sets and Databases for Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of computational chemistry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) potentials to predict molecular properties with high accuracy and efficiency, providing a viable alternative to traditional quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which are often computationally intensive. Central to the success of ML models is the quality and comprehensiveness of the data sets on which they are trained. Quantum chemistry data sets and databases, comprising extensive information on molecular structures, energies, forces, and other properties derived from QM calculations, are crucial for developing robust and generalizable ML potentials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of quantum chemical data sets and databases. We examine key characteristics and functionalities of prominent resources, including the types of information they store, the level of electronic structure theory employed, the diversity of chemical space covered, and the methodologies used for data creation. Additionally, an updatable resource is provided to track new data sets and databases at https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/datasets_and_databases_4_MLPs. Looking forward, we discuss the challenges associated with the rapid growth of quantum chemical data sets and databases, emphasizing the need for updatable and accessible resources to ensure the long-term utility of them. We also address the importance of data format standardization and the ongoing efforts to align with the FAIR principles to enhance data interoperability and reusability. Drawing inspiration from established materials databases, we advocate for the development of user-friendly and sustainable platforms for these data sets and databases.</description>

      <title>Site- and Energy-Selective Low-Energy Electron Emission by X-Rays in Aqueous Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy-electron emission from resonant Auger final states via intermolecular Coulombic decay (RA-ICD) has been previously described as a promising scenario for controlling radiation damage for medical purposes, but has so far only been observed in prototypical atomic and molecular van der Waals dimers and clusters. Here, we report the experimental observation of RA-ICD in aqueous solution. We show that for solvated Ca$^{2+}$ ions, the emission can be very efficiently controlled by tuning the photon energy of exciting X-rays to inner-shell resonances of the ions. Our results provide the next step from proving RA-ICD in relatively simple prototype systems to understanding the relevance and potential applications of ICD in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Windowed Mean Trajectory Approximation for Condensed Phase Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a trajectory-based quasiclassical method for approximating dynamics in condensed phase systems. Building upon the previously developed Optimized Mean Trajectory (OMT) approximation that has been used to compute linear and nonlinear spectra, we borrow some ideas from filtering trajectory methods to obtain a novel semiclassical method for the dynamical propagation of density matrices. This new approximation is tested rigorously against standard multistate electronic models, spin-boson model, and models of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. In all instances, the current method is significantly better or as good as many other semiclassical methods available, especially in low-temperature. All results are tested against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion method. The new method shows excellent agreement across various parameter regimes with numerically exact results, highlighting the robustness and accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford diagonalization for measurement shot reduction in quantum expectation value estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.</description>

      <title>Competing quantum effects in spin crossover chains: spin-orbit coupling, magnetic exchange, and elastic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and study a model of square planar, d8 spin crossover materials that treats elastic, magnetic and spin-orbit interactions on an equal footing. For 1D chains density matrix renormalization group calculations show that the competition between these interactions leads to six different phases. For weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and large antiferromagnetic interactions we find a symmetry protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase. This is equivalent to the Haldane-large-D phase transition driven by single ion anisotropy(D) in the spin-one Heisenberg model. For strong SOC the Sz=+-1 HS states are high-energy excitations. Thus, the system can be understood as a transverse field Ising model with the SOC playing the role of the transverse field. Consistent with this, we find a quantum phase transition between the THS phase and a quantum disordered (QD) phase. However, if the magnetic coupling is non-zero or the HS and LS states of a single molecule are non-degenerate the Z2 (Ising) symmetry is broken and the phase transition becomes a crossover. Thus, the QD phase and the THS phases are adiabatically connected, as, equivalently, are the large-D phase of the spin-one Heisenberg model and the quantum disordered phase of the transverse field Ising model. We also find a ferroelastic LS phase, and antierroelastic phase, with alternating HS and LS complexes, and a dimer phase, which results from the competition between antiferromagnetic and antiferroelastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Finite-order method to calculate approximate density matrices in the Fock-space multireference coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient approach to calculate approximate pure-state and transition reduced density matrices in the framework of the multireference relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster (FS CC) theory is proposed. The method is based on the effective operator formalism and consists of the direct substitution of the FS CC Ansatz for a wave operator into the effective operator expression with the subsequent truncation of expansion at the terms quadratic in cluster amplitudes. The final density matrix is defined by active-space density matrices of different ranks "dressed" with contributions from cluster operators. The method gives a connected expression for pure-state density matrices, provided that the intermediate normalization condition is fulfilled. Moreover, under some additional assumptions, the connectivity can also be ensured for calculated transition property matrix elements and natural transition spinors. The developed technique allows for fast and accurate calculations of one-particle reduced density matrices for a wide range of electronic states. A pilot application of the new technique to construct averaged atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis sets for fully relativistic electronic structure calculations is presented.</description>

      <title>Basis set extrapolation from the vanishing counterpoise correction condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basis set extrapolations are typically rationalized either from analytical arguments involving the partial-wave or principal expansions of the correlation energy in helium-like systems, or from fitting extrapolation parameters to reference energetics for a small(ish) training set. Seeking to avoid both, we explore a third alternative: extracting extrapolation parameters from the requirement that the BSSE (basis set superposition error) should vanish at the complete basis set limit. We find this to be a viable approach provided that the underlying basis sets are not too small and reasonably well balanced. For basis sets not augmented by diffuse functions, BSSE minimization and energy fitting yield quite similar parameters.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Molecular Property Prediction: A Survey of Single and Multimodal Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, spanning drug discovery, material science, and environmental chemistry. Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in MPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular structures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a fundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this, representation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative and interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores recent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple modality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule representations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of modalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation. The article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future research directions to advance the field of MPP.</description>
