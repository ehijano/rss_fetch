      <title>Prospects for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment with polyatomic molecules in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the conceptual design of an experiment to measure the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) using $^{138}$BaOH molecules in an optical lattice. The BaOH molecule is laser-coolable and highly sensitive to the eEDM, making it an attractive candidate for such a precision measurement, and capturing it in an optical lattice offers potentially very long coherence times. We study possibilities and limitations of this approach, identify the most crucial limiting factors and ways to overcome them. The proposed apparatus can reach a statistical error of $10^{-30}\,e\,$cm by measuring spin precession on a total number of $5 \times 10^9$ molecules over a span of 120 days.</description>

      <title>Compact optical waveform generator with digital feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key requirement for quantum technologies based on atoms, ions, and molecules, is the ability to realize precise phase- and amplitude-controlled quantum operations via coherent laser pulses. However, for generating pulses on the sub-microsecond timescale, the characteristics of the optical and electronic components can introduce unwanted distortions that have a detrimental effect on the fidelity of quantum operations. In this paper, we present a compact arbitrary waveform generator that integrates a double-pass acousto-optic modulator for user-specified laser amplitude and phase modulations. Additionally, the module integrates an optical heterodyne detector to extract the precise laser pulse shape in real-time. The measured pulse shape is then fed into a digital feedback loop used to estimate the complex-valued transfer function and pre-distorted input pulses. We demonstrate the performance by generating shaped laser pulses suitable for realizing quantum logic gates with durations down to 180\,ns, requiring only a small number of feedback iterations.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Scale-(in)dependence in quantum 4-body scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-channel 4-body scattering system using regularized 2- and 3-body contact interactions. The analysis determines the sensitivity of bound-state energies, scattering phase shifts and cross sections on the cutoff parameter ($\lambda$), and the energy gaps between scattering thresholds. The latter dependency is obtained with a 2-body scale fixed to an unnaturally large value and a floating 3-body parameter. Specifically, we calculate the binding energies of the shallow 3- and 4-body states, dimer-dimer and trimer-atom scattering lengths, and the trimer-atom to dimer-dimer reaction rates. Employing a potential renormalized by a large 2-body scattering length and a 3-body scale, we find all calculated observables to remain practically constant over the range $6\textrm{fm}^{-2}&lt;\lambda&lt;10\textrm{fm}^{-2}$. Divergences in scattering lengths emerge for critical 3-body parameters at which thresholds are degenerate. Such threshold effects are found to be independent of the regulator cutoff.
  Furthermore, at those critical points where the dimer-dimer and trimer-atom thresholds overlap, we predict an enhancement of the inelastic over the elastic scattering event. Such an inversion between elastic- and rearrangement-collision probabilities indicates a strong sensitivity of the 4-body reaction dynamics on the 3-body parameter at finite 2-body scale. This phenomenon is absent in earlier studies which differ in the renormalization scheme. As this discrepancy arises for all considered cutoffs, a more comprehensive parametrization of short-distance structure is necessary: sole cutoff variation does not reveal non-perturbative change in reaction rates conjectured to be due to a combined effect of the finite 2-body range and the specific choice for the 3-body parameter.</description>

      <title>Multi-zone trapped-ion qubit control in an integrated photonics QCCD device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplexed operations and extended coherent control over multiple trapping sites are fundamental requirements for a trapped-ion processor in a large scale architecture. Here we demonstrate these building blocks using a surface-electrode trap with integrated photonic components which are scalable to larger numbers of zones. We implement a Ramsey sequence using the integrated light in two zones, separated by 375 $\mu$m, performing transport of the ion from one zone to the other in 200 $\mu$s between pulses. In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we developed techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk, and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multi-zone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion QCCD architecture.</description>
