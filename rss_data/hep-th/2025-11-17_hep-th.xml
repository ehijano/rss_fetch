      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

      <title>Anomalous resonance in Weyl semimetals: A holographic study of non-linear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hairy, magnetic black brane solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Dilaton theory with full back-reaction of the scalar and gauge fields and compute the time evolution with time dependent sources. The dual field theory's 't Hooft anomaly leads to long-lived current oscillations in the low temperature limit long after the electric pulse which created these modes has been switched off. We find that, generally, non-linear effects increase the decay rates of long-lived modes by a temperature dependent amount. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the life-time of time-translation symmetry breaking states can be made arbitrarily large if the temperature after the quench is sufficiently small. Experimentally this might be realizable in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Where is the Entropy in DSSYK-de Sitter? Correction to a wrong claim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question arises in the holographic description of the static patch of de Sitter space: Where does the entropy reside? The answer of course is in the stretched horizon, but how far from the mathematical horizon is the stretched horizon? In recent papers and lectures I argued that the entropy in DSSYK/JT-de Sitter resides at a string distance from the horizon. That conclusion was based on misconception about the confinement-deconfinement transition in the 't Hooft model. When corrected the right answer is of order the Planck distance (which differs from the string distance by a factor of order $\sqrt{N}).$</description>

      <title>Algebraic Consistency and Explicit Construction of One-Loop BCJ Numerators of Yang-Mills and Related Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of one-loop BCJ numerators in Yang-Mills and related theories. Starting from the propagator matrix that connects colour-ordered integrands to numerators, we identify the consistency conditions that ensure the existence of Jacobi-satisfying numerator solutions and determine the unique construction. The relation between one-loop numerators and forward-limit tree numerators is clarified, together with the additional physical conditions required for a consistent double-copy interpretation.
  We propose a two-step expansion strategy for obtaining explicit one-loop numerators. The Yang-Mills integrand is first decomposed into scalar-loop Yang-Mills-scalar building blocks, which are then expanded into bi-adjoint scalar integrands. We derive explicit results for up to three external gluons, showing how the kinematic consistency conditions uniquely determine the coefficients in each case. Similar results for Einstein-Yang-Mills and gravity amplitudes are also presented.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Symmetries in Einstein-Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive derivation of the Einstein-Maxwell charges and fluxes in the near-horizon region of a four-dimensional non-extremal black hole, with vanishing cosmological constant. Specifically, we present a detailed derivation of the Noether charges within both the metric and first-order formulations, elucidating the relationship between the Carrollian internal boost charge and the Lorentz boost charge. It is well-established in the literature that Carrollian fluids exhibit an internal local boost symmetry; we demonstrate that this symmetry precisely corresponds to a Lorentz internal transformation. Finally, we prove that the near-horizon Einstein equations can be obtained from the flux-balance law by employing the generalized Barnich-Troessaert bracket.</description>

      <title>Macdonald index from 3d TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new fermionic sum formula for the Macdonald index for a class of Argyres-Douglas theories. The formula arises naturally from a three-dimensional topological field theory obtained by a twisted dimensional reduction of the 4d theory. Such a reduction often gives rise to a 3d ${\mathcal N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theory that is expected to flow to an ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal fixed point. After performing a topological twist, we obtain a 3d TFT admitting boundary conditions that support the vertex operator algebra associated with the original 4d theory. In this framework, the Macdonald index appears as a half-index of the 3d gauge theory, with the Macdonald grading determined by a distinguished $U(1)_A$ symmetry in the infrared ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal algebra. We present a general procedure to identify this $U(1)_A$ symmetry and, whenever possible, show that it produces the known prescription for computing the Macdonald index from the refined character of the associated vertex operator algebra. Our construction also gives a hint towards the IR formula for the Macdonald index, from the 4d BPS particles on the Coulomb branch.</description>

      <title>Thick oriented and nonoriented center-vortex $SU(N)$ configurations with fractional topological charge lumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed oriented and nonoriented center vortices are known to generate nontrivial topological charge. However, most previous analyses have been restricted to Abelian-projected thin configurations. Studies of thick vortices have so far focused on the $SU(2)$ case and on the intersection of a single pair of oriented objects. In this work, we construct mixed oriented and nonoriented thick center-vortex gauge fields in $SU(N)$ with smooth profiles and explicit non-Abelian phases. These phases ensure a smooth interpolation between different Cartan fluxes at monopole junctions. We analyze the resulting topological charge density and visualize its morphology, elucidating the color structures responsible for fractional lumps that together yield a nonvanishing global charge.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries: locality, unitarity, and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the apparent tension between locality and unitarity for symmetries in quantum field theory. This emerges in the context of categorical symmetries where symmetry operators are generically non-invertible. We argue that locality imposes particular regularities in the action of symmetries on the Hilbert space. This allows us to introduce an observable that can measure the properties of the non-locality for symmetry operators. We study it for a class of examples and demonstrate that this observable can encode data associated to the fusion algebra of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating baryonic tubes supported by $\pi$- and $\omega$-mesons and its flat limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct self-gravitating topological solitons in the $SU(N)$ Einstein non-linear sigma model coupled to $\omega$-vector-mesons in $D=4$ space-time dimensions. These solutions represent tube-like configurations free of curvature singularities and possess a non-vanishing topological charge identified as the baryon number. We show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the exponential representation, the tubes can be constructed for arbitrary values of the flavor number, $N$, with the topological charge being proportional to this number. The flat limit of this solution, which corresponds to an array of baryonic tubes in a finite volume, is analyzed in detail. Remarkably, although the energy of the solitons at a finite volume is an increasing function of $N$, the binding energy decreases as the number of flavors present in the theory increases, reaffirming that the inclusion of more than two flavors improves the predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>Search for possible signals of space-time non-commutativity from ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-commutative geometry offers an effective framework for describing physics at the Planck scale, incorporating generic quantum-gravitational effects through an intrinsic minimal length and the $\kappa$-deformed space-time stands out as a particularly well-developed model based on a Lie-algebraic type non-commutative space-time structure. We investigate the inflationary paradigm and the associated primordial perturbations within the framework of $\kappa$-deformed non-commutative space-time. By constructing a scalar field theory invariant under the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra, we derive the deformed oscillator algebra for the field modes of the primordial perturbations resulting in the non-trivial scale dependent modification of both the scalar and tensor power spectra. Further, we compute the corresponding $\kappa$-deformed corrections to the scalar spectral index and its running, finding that the $\kappa$-deformation naturally provides a higher value for spectral index which offers a potential resolution to the discrepancy between the values reported by PLANCK and ACT. Finally we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using the latest ACT DR6 data, constraining the $\kappa$-deformed non-commutative length scale to $\lambda=2.17^{+2.33}_{-1.53}\times 10^{-30}m$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting the precision cosmology as a powerful probe of quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Analytic structure of the high-energy gravitational amplitude: multi-H diagrams and classical 5PM logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy, small-angle limit of two-body gravitational scattering. Using power counting arguments and dispersion relations in an effective field theory for the Regge regime, we derive the general loop expansion that determines how the leading Regge logarithms and their complex structure arise as a power series in $t/s$. Focusing on the tower of multi-H diagrams that govern the leading logarithmic behavior, we compute the leading double logarithm at four loops (5PM) using both effective field theory methods and the multi-Regge expansion, finding complete agreement. Finally, using the aforementioned dispersion relations, we extract the single logarithmic contribution to the imaginary part of the eikonal phase at 5PM in the Regge limit.</description>

      <title>Discrete Basis Parameterization for the Gauge Theory Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the Gauge Theory Bootstrap (GTB) framework, initiated by He and Kruczenski in arXiv:2309.12402 and arXiv:2403.10772, using a discrete basis parametrization of the 2-to-2 pion scattering S-matrix, the spectral densities and the form factors. This approach enables a refined analysis of the convergence of the GTB and drastically reduced computational time --from approximately half an hour in arXiv:2403.10772 to under one minute in ours. The discrete basis also facilitates the evaluation of the S-matrix across the complex sheet resulting, in additional of the dominant $\rho(770)$ and $f_2(1270)$ resonances identified in arXiv:2403.10772, in the extraction of the $\sigma$ meson pole located far from the real axis.</description>

      <title>Integrability for the spectrum of Jordanian AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jordanian deformations offer rare integrable realisations of non-AdS holography, whose solvability methods differ from conventional AdS/CFT examples. Here we study the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,R)$ sector of the Jordanian deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ string and its weak-coupling spin chain counterpart: the $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ model with a non abelian Jordanian Drinfel'd twist. While the twist breaks the usual highest-weight structure that underlies conventional Bethe ans\"atze, we show that the complete spectrum remains solvable within the Baxter framework. We argue that the functional form of the $TQ$-relation is unchanged, yet the structure of the $Q$-functions is nontrivially modified. This allows us to obtain analytic expressions at arbitrary spin chain length $J$, which match the deformed string spectrum at the one-loop level and to subleading order in the large-$J$ expansion, despite the severely reduced symmetry. Our results provide nontrivial tests of the Jordanian AdS/CFT correspondence and lay the groundwork for implementing the Separation of Variables program in non-abelian Drinfel'd-twisted models.</description>

      <title>$CPT$-Symmetric K\"ahler-Dirac Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K\"ahler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model.</description>

Abstract: Contemporary understanding of thermalization in quantum field theory stems largely from understanding properties of transient excitations of equilibria. These nonhydrodynamic excitations are known to structurally differ between weakly- and strongly-coupled quantum field theories with no known results at intermediate values of the interaction strength. We demonstrate that all the known behaviors of transient excitations can be understood as a consequence of different realizations of a symmetry principle, the shift symmetry, applied at the level of the far from equilibrium generalization of the hydrodynamic effective action that we explicitly construct. Our approach naturally includes the effects of stochastic fluctuations outside the hydrodynamic regime and allows to explicitly construct hybrid models interpolating between weak- and strong-coupling behavior. We study properties of one such model motivated by thermalization in nuclear collisions in light of the QCD running coupling.</description>

      <title>Convolutions and Gaussians in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kadanoff-Wilson-Fisher approach to renormalization is based upon studying the renormalization transform, which may be described as an action of the monoid $\mathbb{R}^{\times}_{\geq 1}$ on a suitable space of interactions. It is typically computed by manipulating the path integral or the perturbation series. Here we will present an alternative algebraic description of the renormalization transform. We treat the space of interactions as a semigroup under convolution and act on it with a Lie group associated with the quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spacetime Imprints: The 24-Cell, Standard Model Symmetry and Its Flavor Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work \cite{FaragAli:2024jpo} we outlined an exploratory framework in which the 24-cell acts both as the quantum of spacetime and as a geometric representation of elementary particles. In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constants of motion and fundamental frequencies for elliptic orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the case of nonspinning compact binary systems on quasi-elliptic orbits, I obtain the conservative map between the constants of motion (energy and angular momentum) and the fundamental (radial and azimuthal) frequencies at the fourth post-Newtonian order, including both instantaneous and tail contributions. This map is expressed in terms of an enhancement function of the eccentricity, which is appropriately resummed to ensure accuracy for any eccentricity; in particular, I recover known results for circular orbits. In order to obtain this map, the local dynamics are expressed using an action-angle formulation. The tail term is treated as a perturbation, which is first localized in time, then Delaunay-averaged. Both operations require a contact transformation of the phase-space variables, which I explicitly control. Using the first law of binary black hole mechanics, I then obtain the orbit-averaged redshift invariant for eccentric orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order; when properly accounting for the tail contributions, it perfectly agrees with analytical self-force at postgeodesic order [arXiv:2203.13832]. Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies.</description>

      <title>Simplified Spin Dependence in Dark Matter Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions of dark matter with Standard Model particles can be systematically studied in the language of effective field theories. We investigate dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, including spin-dependent interactions, for direct detection experiments and demonstrate that, although the scattering rate generally depends on multiple types of material response functions, certain linear combinations of these material response functions vanish if the initial and final electronic states share the same Hamiltonian. We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrable bootstrap program allows one to express the tempered distributions associated with the multipoint functions of the integrable 1+1 dimensional Sinh-Gordon quantum field theory by means of explicit series. The convergence of the latter is an open problem that was only solved for the two-point case. In this work, by taking for granted the convergence of these series, we show that these expressions satisfy all of the Wightman axioms. This thus shows that, upon a yet to be proven convergence property, the integrable bootstrap based construction of correlation functions does lead to a quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>New picture on the mesons mass relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is divided in two parts. In the first three sections we review the meson physics phenomenology, highlighting the history of the pseudoscalar multiplet mass spectra research. Then we propose a new approach for the mass mixing problem exclusively based on a second order phase transition principle. This development leads to new relations among the masses of the mesons in this nonet, which present a nice agreement with measurements. Also the quark constitutions and the mixing angle problem are correctly addressed. Then, after describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking process coming from this phenomenological analysis, we establish a field theory with the necessary elements that could reproduce theoretically such results. This is done in the second part of this work. In the end, our quantum analysis of this field theory shows a compatibility with the phenomenology, which allows for further exploration along this path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic aspects of ordinary and lower dimensional noncommutative black holes within an extended anti-de Sitter phase space by treating the negative cosmological constant and the minimal cut-off length as thermodynamic variables representing the pressure and tension of the system, respectively. In four-dimensional spacetime, the regular black hole exhibits a small/large black hole phase transition analogous to the liquid/gas transition of a Van der Waals gas. The three-dimensional case demonstrates global and local thermodynamic stability, while the two-dimensional case reveals a novel type of transition referred to as the anti-Hawking-Page transition.</description>

      <title>The Semiclasscical limit of $SU(3)$ Gauge Field Coherent States: Peakedness and Overlap Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux and its topological effects in Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon in which the quantum state of a charged particle acquires a phase shift that is directly proportional to the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, due to a (classical) magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$, which is confined in a spatial region from which the magnetic field cannot escape. Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.</description>

      <title>NJL-Chiral Soliton and the Nucleon Equation of State at supra-saturation density: Impact of Chiral Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that, at sufficiently high baryon densities, the equation of state (EoS) of bulk nuclear matter can be identified with that of the nucleon core. In this work, we illustrate how the energy density and pressure distributions inside individual nucleons can be utilized to construct the EoS of supra-dense matter. In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schr\"odinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.</description>

      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis Emerges in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

      <title>Coupled Proca theories: Green-hyperbolicity, quantization and applications to polarization measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Proca field describes a massive relativistic spin-$1$ particle and was originally formulated in Minkowski spacetime. Here we consider a variety of generalizations in globally hyperbolic spacetimes, including couplings between a number of Proca fields via a mass-matrix, the charged Proca field with arbitrary magnetic moment in an arbitrary external electromagnetic field, and a Proca-Klein-Gordon theory with a spacetime-dependent bilinear coupling. The equations are analysed using a general auxiliary field method, introduced here, which provides practical criteria for showing that a given operator is (semi)-Green-hyperbolic. The method goes beyond what is achieved in existing analyses of deformed equations, which for example place restrictions on the magnetic moment and electromagnetic potential that can be coupled to a Proca field. The theories considered can be quantized following a common pattern and all the examples treated in this work admit Hadamard states on any globally hyperbolic spacetime.
  As an application, the Proca-Klein-Gordon system is used to develop a measurement scheme sensitive to the Proca polarization, using a Klein-Gordon field as the probe. For a suitable family of $n$-particle Proca states, the leading-order probe response accords with Malus' law, confirming that this system acts as a polarization-sensitive detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the two-loop amplitudes for a self-dual Higgs boson with up to four positive helicity gluons in the heavy top-quark limit. Because the tree amplitudes in the all-plus sector vanish, we can construct simple representations of the polylogarithmic parts of the two-loop amplitudes using four-dimensional unitarity cuts into rational one-loop and tree amplitudes. The remaining rational function ambiguity is extracted from a tensor integral reduction over finite fields. The final expressions are presented using polylogarithms up to weight two and compact rational functions of spinor-helicity products.</description>

      <title>Topological vertex formalism with O5-plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.01928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new topological vertex formalism for Type IIB $(p,q)$ 5-brane web with an O5-plane. We apply our proposal to 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sp(1) gauge theory with $N_f=0,1,8$ flavors to compute the topological string partition functions and check the agreement with the known results. Especially for the $N_f=8$ case, which corresponds to E-string theory on a circle, we obtain a new, yet simple, expression of the partition function with two Young diagram sum.</description>

      <title>Emission of linearly polarized photons in a strongly coupled magnetized plasma from the gauge/gravity correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.08802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use holographic methods to show that photons emitted by a strongly coupled plasma subject to a magnetic field are linearly polarized regardless of their four-momentum, except when they propagate along the field direction. The gravitational dual is constructed using a 5D truncation of 10-dimensional type IIB supergravity, and includes a scalar field in addition to the constant magnetic one. In terms of the geometry of the collision experiment that we model, our statement is that any photon produced there has to be in its only polarization state parallel to the reaction plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise the AKSZ construction when dealing with generic local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant, these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE in which the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among the equivalent weak gauge PDEs describing a given system, a minimal one can usually be found and is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arises from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples, including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory and a finite jet-bundle. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to the characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs that correspond to local theories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice and modified energy-momentum relations.</description>

      <title>Universality of giant graviton correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) integrated correlators of superconformal primary operators in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory involving two light operators from the stress-tensor multiplet and two heavy operators whose conformal dimensions are proportional to the number of colours $N$. In the large-$N$ limit these heavy operators are dual to sphere and AdS giant gravitons, realised holographically as D3-branes wrapping an $S^3$ inside either the $S^5$ or the $AdS_5$ factor of the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background geometry. These HHLL correlators thus describe the scattering of two gravitons off D3-branes. In the planar limit we derive exact expressions for the HHLL integrated correlators as functions of both the 't Hooft coupling and the giant graviton dimension. Remarkably, despite exhibiting distinct perturbative expansions at weak coupling, these integrated correlators share the same universal asymptotic series at strong coupling. We also demonstrate that a seemingly unrelated integrated correlator in a $USp(2N)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory, holographically dual to gluon-graviton scattering off D7-branes, exhibits precisely the same strong coupling asymptotic series. This reveals a striking universality of D-brane scattering processes. Furthermore, we compute the exponentially suppressed corrections at strong coupling for all these observables, showing that they are precisely the non-perturbative effects that account for the differences between these integrated correlators beyond the universal asymptotic series. Finally, we comment on the resurgent properties and the holographic interpretation of these exponentially suppressed terms.</description>

      <title>Unitarity and the On-Shell Action of Worldline Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the on-shell action formalism within Worldline Quantum Field Theory (WQFT) to describe scattering of spinning compact bodies in General Relativity in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The real on-shell action is constructed from vacuum diagrams with causal (retarded) propagators from which scattering observables such as momentum impulse and spin kick follow via Poisson brackets of the initial scattering data. Furthermore, we explore the implications of unitarity at the level of the worldline and show how generalised unitarity techniques can be adapted to WQFT to efficiently compute multi-loop contributions. Our work establishes a concrete link between WQFT and amplitude-based methods, elucidating how unitarity cuts ensure equivalence between the on-shell action derived from either approach. Extending the state-of-the-art, we complete the full on-shell action -- including dissipative terms -- at (formal) 3PM order and up to quartic spin interactions on both massive bodies.</description>

      <title>Topological Vertex for Symmetric matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel topological vertex formalism for 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) gauge theory with a hypermultiplet in the symmetric tensor representation, whose Type IIB brane construction involves an NS5-brane attached to an O7$^+$-plane. Inspired by the identification $\mathrm{O7}^+\sim \mathbb{Z}_2 + 4 \mathrm{D7}$, we introduce two new types of vertices: the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vertex, which implements the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold action, and the FD-vertex, which encodes the monodromy cut induced by the O7$^+$-plane. This formalism generalizes the framework presented in arXiv:2412.19655 and establishes a systematic method for computing partition functions for 5-brane configurations that incorporate an O7$^+$-plane. The resulting partition functions are expressed as sums over Young diagrams, providing a powerful computational tool for studying such gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative Geometry for D-Branes in Large R-R Field Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of non-commutative geometry in D$p$-branes within large R-R field backgrounds. In this context, the background of a significant ($p-1$)-form R-R field can be effectively described using a ($p-1$)-bracket, similar to the method used in the NS-NS case. We begin by recalling how non-commutative geometry arises from the quantization of open string theory. In this framework, the Seiberg-Witten map is a key element that establishes the equivalence between commutative and non-commutative descriptions in the low-energy effective theory. The Poisson bracket characterizes non-commutative structures, with deformation achieved through the Moyal product. Next, we show how the Nambu-Poisson bracket emerges in the context of a single D4-brane with the large R-R field background limit, starting from the BLG model. The generalization to a D$p$-brane leads to the ($p-1$)-bracket description, which reveals a duality web relating NS-NS and R-R field backgrounds via T-duality and S-duality in the low-energy limit. Finally, we extend the single D-brane construction to multiple D-branes by promoting the ordinary product in the bracket to a covariant derivative at the Poisson level.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy from Heat Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for computing symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies (SREE) in charged quantum systems based on an improved heat kernel approach. Although the conventional Sommerfeld formula proves effective for neutral systems, it encounters limitations when gauge fields or chemical potentials are introduced due to incomplete residue prescriptions and violations of asymptotic boundary conditions. By reconstructing the analytic structure of the heat kernel using a sign-dependent phase factor, we derive a globally convergent expansion that reconciles discrete residue summations with continuous spectral decompositions. We further apply this framework to Gaussian continuous multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA) states and show that the entanglement entropy (EE) can be expressed in terms of the cMERA flow functions. In particular, we obtain a symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy flow equation in the presence of a chemical potential. This formulation extends naturally to arbitrary spacetime dimensions and recovers established results for neutral systems in the mu -&gt; 0 limit. We validate our framework through two settings: (1) exact agreement with (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) predictions using twist-operator techniques, and (2) consistency with holographic entropy calculations on S1 x H^(d-1) geometries. Our results both unify the treatment of charged and neutral entanglement entropy and extend this treatment to real-space renormalization frameworks, providing a robust tool for probing symmetry-resolved entanglement in conformal field theories, their holographic duals, and cMERA representations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$ deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side. The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <title>Dark-sector modifications to Kerr and Reissner-Nordstrom black hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the evaporation dynamics of Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Reissner- Nordstrom black holes, focusing on the evolution of their mass, charge, and angular momentum, using detailed calculations of the corresponding Page factors. We investigate the evolution of black holes during the evaporation process, emphasizing how these quantities evolve relative to one another. Our study incorporates the effects of greybody factors, near-extremal conditions, and the introduction of additional particle species beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that the addition of particle degrees of freedom may significantly alter the evaporation hierarchy, potentially leading to scenarios in which the effective black hole charge increases during evaporation. Additionally, we examine the impact of Schwinger pair production and of super-radiance on charged, spinning black hole evaporation. These findings offer new insights into the complex interplay between different black hole parameters during evaporation and highlight the importance of considering additional particle species in the process.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic and Strong Coupling Models in Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the cosmological implications of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a modified gravitational theory formulated from Weyl geometry. The nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is coupled to the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. We analyze two models based on the logarithmic and strong coupling form of the function $f(Q,T)$. The corresponding field equations are then solved numerically after reformulating the system in terms of redshift. We used combined dataset from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon$^+$ supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the model parameters. Using the constrained parameters, the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the models are analyzed. The results successfully describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion for both the models. The models mostly exhibit quintessence-like behavior and asymptotically approach the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at late times. The calculated age of the Universe from each model aligns with constraints from Planck and stellar age data. The violation of the strong energy condition and the satisfaction of null energy condition and dominant energy conditions are shown.</description>

      <title>Theories of the gravity+gauge type in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theories of the "General Relativity + Yang-Mills" type in 4d spacetime with cosmological constant, focusing on formulations where the basic variables are connections and curvatures (but no metric). We present a new Lagrangian for GR coupled to Yang-Mills, which uses the same kind of variables for both sectors, and is suggestive of the double-copy structure. This Lagrangian comes in both non-chiral (real) and chiral (complex) versions. The chiral version makes it easy to isolate the self-dual sector. The latter lends itself to a higher-spin (HS) generalization, which combines the HS Self-Dual GR and HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills of Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We then descend from the covariant formulation to lightcone gauge, and construct a cubic-exact lightcone action. For HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills, we solve the lightcone field equations to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the relation between lightcone foliations that share a lightray - a setup relevant for the scattering problem in the de Sitter static patch. We derive this relation at the linearized level, and argue from causality+symmetry that it cannot receive non-linear corrections. We explore the associated gauge transformations in the non-linear covariant theory.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutron Skin through Event-by-Event Pion Asymmetry in Heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for probing the neutron skin thickness of gold (Au) by analyzing the event-by-event distribution of $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{+}$ yield differences. This is achieved through SMASH simulations of ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV. Our results demonstrate that the mean value of $\Delta n_{\pi} = n_{\pi^{-}} - n_{\pi^{+}}$, along with the Pearson correlation and mutual information between $(\pi^{-}+\pi^{+})$ and $(\pi^{-}-\pi^{+})$, all scale linearly with the neutron skin thickness. Moreover, the slope of the line connecting two distinct $\Delta n_{\pi}$ values in the event-by-event distribution also exhibits a linear dependence on the neutron skin thickness. The most sensitive $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs are identified as $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, 2)$. These findings establish a new pathway for determining the neutron skin thickness. Finally, by comparing SMASH and UrQMD simulations under identical initial conditions, we observe that individual slope values depend on the specific collision model. However, by extracting slopes from multiple $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs in experimental event-by-event data and inferring the corresponding neutron skin thickness, one can assess which model better aligns with the true physical value.</description>
