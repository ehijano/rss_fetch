      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. This problem is known as Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Path Problem (POHPP). Here, we study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary Hamiltonian Path problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$. We show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4. We complement this result by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2. Furthermore, we show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for graphs of clique cover number 2 and $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for some distance-to-$\mathcal{G}$ parameters, including distance to path and distance to clique. In addition, we present $\mathsf{XP}$ and $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for parameters such as distance to block and feedback edge set number.</description>

      <title>Metric-Based Granular Computing in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks can be highly complex systems with numerous interconnected components and interactions. Granular computing offers a framework to manage this complexity by decomposing networks into smaller, more manageable components, or granules. In this article, we introduce metric-based granular computing technique to study networks. This technique can be applied to the analysis of networks where granules can represent subsets of nodes or edges and their interactions can be studied at different levels of granularity. We model the network as an information system and investigate its granular structures using metric representation. We establish that the concepts of reducts in rough set theory and resolving sets in networks are equivalent. Through this equivalence, we present a novel approach for computing all the minimal resolving sets of these networks.</description>

      <title>Approximating Maximum Edge 2-Coloring by Normalizing Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a simple, undirected graph G, an edge 2-coloring is a coloring of the edges such that no vertex is incident to edges with more than 2 distinct colors. The problem maximum edge 2-coloring (ME2C) is to find an edge 2-coloring in a graph G with the goal to maximize the number of colors. For a relevant graph class, ME2C models anti-Ramsey numbers and it was considered in network applications. For the problem a 2-approximation algorithm is known, and if the input graph has a perfect matching, the same algorithm has been shown to have a performance guarantee of 5/3. It is known that ME2C is APX-hard and that it is UG-hard to obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.5. We show that if the input graph has a perfect matching, there is a polynomial time 1.625-approximation and if the graph is claw-free or if the maximum degree of the input graph is at most three (i.e., the graph is subcubic), there is a polynomial time 1.5-approximation algorithm for ME2C</description>

      <title>Two-person Positive Shortest Path Games Have Nash Equilibria in Pure Stationary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person shortest path game, where the local cost of every move is positive for each player, has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also extend the existence result to infinite graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, our proof gives that a terminal NE (in which the play is a path from the initial position to a terminal) exists provided at least one of the two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If none of the players can do it, in other words, if each of the two players has a strategy that separates all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.
  We extend our result to short paths interdiction games, where at each vertex, we allow one player to block some of the arcs and the other player to choose one of the non-blocked arcs. Assuming that blocking sets are chosen from an independence system given by an oracle, we give an algorithm for computing a NE in time $O(|E|(\log|V|+\tau))$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of arcs, and $\tau$ is the maximum time taken by the oracle on any input.</description>
