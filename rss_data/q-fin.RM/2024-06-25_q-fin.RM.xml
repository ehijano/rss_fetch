      <title>Hedging in Sequential Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentation involves risk. The investigator expends time and money in the pursuit of data that supports a hypothesis. In the end, the investigator may find that all of these costs were for naught and the data fail to reject the null. Furthermore, the investigator may not be able to test other hypotheses with the same data set in order to avoid false positives due to p-hacking. Therefore, there is a need for a mechanism for investigators to hedge the risk of financial and statistical bankruptcy in the business of experimentation.
  In this work, we build on the game-theoretic statistics framework to enable an investigator to hedge their bets against the null hypothesis and thus avoid ruin. First, we describe a method by which the investigator's test martingale wealth process can be capitalized by solving for the risk-neutral price. Then, we show that a portfolio that comprises the risky test martingale and a risk-free process is still a test martingale which enables the investigator to select a particular risk-return position using Markowitz portfolio theory. Finally, we show that a function that is derivative of the test martingale process can be constructed and used as a hedging instrument by the investigator or as a speculative instrument by a risk-seeking investor who wants to participate in the potential returns of the uncertain experiment wealth process. Together, these instruments enable an investigator to hedge the risk of ruin and they enable a investigator to efficiently hedge experimental risk.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic-risk-aware reinforcement learning with extreme-value-theory-based policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of mitigating catastrophic risk (which is risk with very low frequency but very high severity) in the context of a sequential decision making process. This problem is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of observations in the far tail of the distribution of cumulative costs (negative rewards). A policy gradient algorithm is developed, that we call POTPG. It is based on approximations of the tail risk derived from extreme value theory. Numerical experiments highlight the out-performance of our method over common benchmarks, relying on the empirical distribution. An application to financial risk management, more precisely to the dynamic hedging of a financial option, is presented.</description>

      <title>Cash non-additive risk measures: horizon risk and generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horizon risk (see arXiv:2301.04971) is studied in the context of cash non-additive fully-dynamic risk measures induced by BSDEs. Furthermore, we introduce a risk measure based on generalized Tsallis entropy which can dynamically evaluate the riskiness of losses considering both horizon risk and interest rate uncertainty. The new q-entropic risk measure on losses can be used as a quantification of capital requirement.</description>

      <title>An optimal investment strategy aimed at maximizing the expected utility across all intermediate capital levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates an optimal investment problem for an insurance company operating under the Cramer-Lundberg risk model, where investments are made in both a risky asset and a risk-free asset. In contrast to other literature that focuses on optimal investment and/or reinsurance strategies to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth within a given time horizon, this work considers the expected value of utility accumulation across all intermediate capital levels of the insurer. By employing the Dynamic Programming Principle, we prove a verification theorem, in order to show that any solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation solves our optimization problem. Subject to some regularity conditions on the solution of the HJB equation, we establish the existence of the optimal investment strategy. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical findings, we present numerical examples.</description>
