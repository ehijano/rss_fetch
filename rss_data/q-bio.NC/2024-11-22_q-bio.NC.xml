Abstract: In the dorsal horn, projection neurons play a significant role in pain processing by transmitting sensory stimuli to supraspinal centers during nociception. Following exposure to intense noxious stimuli, a sensitization process occurs to adapt the dorsal horn functional state. Notably, projection neurons can display a switch in firing pattern from tonic firing to plateau potentials with sustained afterdischarges. For afterdischarges to manifest after this switch, the neuron must develop bistability, which characterizes the ability to show resting or spiking at the same input current depending on the context. In numerous instances, neuronal bistability arises through voltage-gated calcium channels. However, computational studies have demonstrated a trade-off between bistability and the plausibility of its resting states if calcium channels are counterbalanced with voltage-gated potassium channels. Current knowledge leaves a gap in understanding the underlying mechanisms by which robust bistability, plateau potentials, and sustained afterdischarges emerge in neurons via calcium channels. In this study, we used a conductance-based model to explore the mechanisms by which L-type calcium (CaL) channels can achieve bistability when combined with either M-type potassium (KM) channels or inward-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Unlike KM channels, Kir channels enhance bistability. Combined with CaL channels, KM and Kir channels promote different types of bistability, with distinct robustness, and function. An analysis of their inward/outward properties revealed that their distinct steady-state currents explain this contrast. Altogether, the complementary of CaL and Kir channels creates a reliable possible pathway for central sensitization in the dorsal horn.</description>
