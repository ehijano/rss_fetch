      <title>Nature of the onset to temperature chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature chaos (TC) in spin glasses has been claimed to exist no matter how small the temperature change, $\Delta T$. However, experimental studies exhibit a finite value of $\Delta T$ for the transition to TC. This paper explores the onset of TC with much higher accuracy over a large temperature range. We find that TC is always present, though small for the smallest $\Delta T$ that we can reliably measure. However, it grows rapidly as $\Delta T$ increases, the region of rapid growth coinciding with the $\Delta T$ predicted from renormalization group arguments and observed experimentally. We are able to transcend the full range for the onset of TC, from fully reversible to fully chaotic.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the bulk polarization in extended and localized phases of a quasiperiodic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite size scaling of the bulk polarization in a quasiperiodic (Aubry-Andr\'{e}) model using the geometric analog of the Binder cumulant. As a proof of concept we show that the geometric Binder cumulant method described here can reproduce the known literature values for the flat and raised cosine distributions, which are the two distributions that occur in the delocalized phase. For the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model at half-filling the phase transition point is accurately reproduced. Not only is the correct size scaling exponent of the variance obtained in the extended and the localized phases, but the geometric Binder cumulant undergoes a sign change at the phase transition. We also calculate the state resolved Binder cumulant as a function of disorder strength to gain insight into the mechanism of the localization transition.</description>

      <title>Physics-integrated Neural Network for Quantum Transport Prediction of Field-effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanics-based transport simulation is of importance for the design of ultra-short channel field-effect transistors (FETs) with its capability of understanding the physical mechanism, while facing the primary challenge of the high computational intensity. Traditional machine learning is expected to accelerate the optimization of FET design, yet its application in this field is limited by the lack of both high-fidelity datasets and the integration of physical knowledge. Here, we introduced a physics-integrated neural network framework to predict the transport curves of sub-5-nm gate-all-around (GAA) FETs using an in-house developed high-fidelity database. The transport curves in the database are collected from literature and our first-principles calculations. Beyond silicon, we included indium arsenide, indium phosphide, and selenium nanowires with different structural phases as the FET channel materials. Then, we built a physical-knowledge-integrated hyper vector neural network (PHVNN), in which five new physical features were added into the inputs for prediction transport characteristics, achieving a sufficiently low mean absolute error of 0.39. In particular, ~98% of the current prediction residuals are within one order of magnitude. Using PHVNN, we efficiently screened out the symmetric p-type GAA FETs that possess the same figures of merit with the n-type ones, which are crucial for the fabrication of homogeneous CMOS circuits. Finally, our automatic differentiation analysis provides interpretable insights into the PHVNN, which highlights the important contributions of our new input parameters and improves the reliability of PHVNN. Our approach provides an effective method for rapidly screening appropriate GAA FETs with the prospect of accelerating the design process of next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal spin-glass transition and aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered systems generically exhibit aging and a glass transition. Previous studies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness. Here, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical Sherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between two identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition from a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as non-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.</description>

      <title>Replica Analysis for Ensemble Techniques in Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection is a problem of statistics that aims to find the subset of the $N$-dimensional possible explanatory variables that are truly related to the generation process of the response variable. In high-dimensional setups, where the input dimension $N$ is comparable to the data size $M$, it is difficult to use classic methods based on $p$-values. Therefore, methods based on the ensemble learning are often used. In this review article, we introduce how the performance of these ensemble-based methods can be systematically analyzed using the replica method from statistical mechanics when $N$ and $M$ diverge at the same rate as $N,M\to\infty, M/N\to\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. As a concrete application, we analyze the power of stability selection (SS) and the derandomized knockoff (dKO) with the $\ell_1$-regularized statistics in the high-dimensional linear model. The result indicates that dKO provably outperforms the vanilla knockoff and the standard SS, while increasing the bootstrap resampling rate in SS might further improve the detection power.</description>

      <title>Epistatic pathways in evolvable mechanical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elastic spring network is an example of evolvable matter. It can be pruned to couple separated pairs of nodes so that when a strain is applied to one of them, the other responds either in-phase or out-of-phase. This produces two pruned networks with incompatible functions that are nearly identical but differ from each other by a set of "mutations," each of which removes or adds a single bond in the network. The effect of multiple mutations is epistatic; that is, the effect of a mutation depends on what other mutations have already occurred. We generate ensembles of network pairs that differ by a fixed number, $M$, of discrete mutations and evaluate all $M!$ mutational paths between the in- and out-of phase behaviors up to $M = 14$. With a threshold response for the network to be considered functional, so that non-functional networks are disallowed, only some mutational pathways are viable. We find that there is a surprisingly high critical response threshold above which no evolutionarily viable path exists between the two networks. The few remaining pathways at this critical value dictate much of the behavior along the evolutionary trajectory. In most cases, the mutations break up into two distinct classes. The analysis clarifies how the number of mutations and the position of a mutation along the pathway affect the evolutionary outcome.</description>

      <title>Impact of ChatGPT on the writing style of condensed matter physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of ChatGPT's release on the writing style of condensed matter papers on arXiv. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant improvement in the English quality of abstracts written by non-native English speakers. Importantly, this improvement remains robust even after accounting for other potential factors, confirming that it can be attributed to the release of ChatGPT. This indicates widespread adoption of the tool. Following the release of ChatGPT, there is a significant increase in the use of unique words, while the frequency of rare words decreases. Across language families, the changes in writing style are significant for authors from the Latin and Ural-Altaic groups, but not for those from the Germanic or other Indo-European groups.</description>
