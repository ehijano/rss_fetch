      <title>Generating background-corrected VPHAS+ HiPS with Montage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for creating background-corrected HiPS (Hierarchical Progressive Surveys) from VPHAS+ images using the Montage toolkit. By combining advanced background correction methods and HiPS generation workflows, we produced high-quality color HiPS from the VST Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge (VPHAS+). These HiPS have been made publicly available through the HiPS network and serve as an invaluable addition to the HiPS ecosystem for astronomers worldwide.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Reconstruction for Radio Detectors of Neutrinos and Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays are excellent probes of astroparticle physics phenomena. For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters such as arrival direction and energy is essential. Radio detection is an established detector concept explored by many observatories; however, current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and, so far, has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in radio detectors with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate, with simulation studies of both neutrinos and cosmic-ray radio signals, that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. This method reduces reconstruction uncertainties and biases compared to previous approaches. Additionally, the Likelihood can be used for event selection and enables differentiable end-to-end detector optimization. The reconstruction code is available through the open-source software NuRadioReco.</description>

      <title>RGC: a radio AGN classifier based on deep learning. I. A semi-supervised model for the VLA images of bent radio AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoders for Learning Image-Spectrum Associations for Galaxy Evolution and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys will produce billions of galaxy images but comparatively few spectra, motivating models that learn cross-modal representations. We build a dataset of 134,533 galaxy images (HSC-PDR2) and spectra (DESI-DR1) and adapt a Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder (MMAE) to embed both images and spectra in a shared representation. The MMAE is a transformer-based architecture, which we train by masking 75% of the data and reconstructing missing image and spectral tokens. We use this model to test three applications: spectral and image reconstruction from heavily masked data and redshift regression from images alone. It recovers key physical features, such as galaxy shapes, atomic emission line peaks, and broad continuum slopes, though it struggles with fine image details and line strengths. For redshift regression, the MMAE performs comparably or better than prior multi-modal models in terms of prediction scatter even when missing spectra in testing. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of masked autoencoders in astrophysics and motivate extensions to additional modalities, such as text, for foundation models.</description>

      <title>The MDW H{\alpha} Sky Survey: Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$ 0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1) includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs (with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.</description>

      <title>Development of the Reconstruction Procedure of the Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes for measuring Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes aims to deploy an array of simplified, autonomous fluorescence telescopes over an area of $\sim60,000$ km$^{2}$ to observe ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The unprecedented size of such an array will enable measurements of cosmic rays with energies above 10$^{20}$ eV with large statistics, providing new insights into UHECR sources. With a single FAST telescope consisting of just four photomultiplier tubes, traditional techniques to reconstruct observed extensive air showers are not applicable. Instead, FAST utilises a top-down approach where simulations are directly compared to data and the best match chosen via a maximum likelihood estimation. This method, known as the "top-down reconstruction (TDR)", requires an accurate "first guess" of the shower parameters to be successful. In this work, improvements to the efficiency and precision of the TDR are made and two different first guess estimation methods are investigated. The combined performance of a machine-learning-based first guess and improved TDR is shown to achieve resolutions in the shower arrival direction, depth of shower maximum and shower energy of $\sim2^\circ$, $\sim30$ g cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim7\%$ respectively for simulated events observed from two or more locations. The improved reconstruction is then applied to data from the current FAST prototype installations at the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array experiment. Using these results, the first measurements of the UHECR energy spectrum and composition by FAST are presented.</description>

      <title>The Programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the 4-m DAG telescope (PLACID) instrument: installation and commissioning update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG telescope (PLACID) instrument is a novel high-contrast direct imaging facility that was recently installed on the new Turkish 4-m DAG telescope. In brief, PLACID consists in a fore-optics coronagraphic intermediate stage platform, installed in-between the TROIA XAO system and the DIRAC HAWAII-1RG focal-plane array. The PLACID instrument was delivered to ATASAM campus facilities in March of 2024, and transported to summit in October of 2024. In February of 2025, the PLACID optical breadboard was craned to the DAG observatory floor, and successfully installed on the optical table of the diffraction-limited Nasmyth platform of the 4-m telescope. Following the official DAG Acceptance milestone in the spring of 2025, Assembly, Integration and Validation (AIV) activities have started in July of 2025, when PLACID was cabled up with all active components fully interfaced and tested for functional integrity. When on-sky by early 2026, PLACID will be the world's first active coronagraph system, fielding a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph from H- to Ks-band. This will provide a wealth of novel options to observers, among which software-only abilities to change or re-align the FPM pattern in function of observational conditions or science requirements. Future features will include non-common path aberrations (NCPA) self-calibration, angular differential imaging (ADI) coronagraphy for binary or triple stars, as well as coherent differential imaging (CDI). We hereby present the PLACID AIV activities that have taken place over the last twelve months, and the next steps for commissioning the instrument internally, and on-sky later this year.</description>

      <title>Solar flare forecasting with foundational transformer models across image, video, and time-series modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of transformer-based architectures for solar flare forecasting using heterogeneous data modalities, including images, video sequences, and time-series observations. Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.</description>

      <title>Improved UVIS Aperture Corrections derived from Focus Diverse PSF Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crowded fields, small-aperture photometry can reduce contamination errors from neighboring sources compared to larger aperture photometry. However, the UVIS encircled energy (EE) varies with detector position and focus variations on orbital timescales for aperture radii less than 10 pixels ($\sim$0.4 arcseconds). Using a set of focus-diverse empirical PSFs by Anderson (2018), we compute 2D spatial maps of the aperture correction between 5-10 pixels and find a maximum change of $\sim$0.01 mag over all focus levels for a given detector position. The upper-left and lower-right corners of the UVIS detector are more focus-sensitive than the rest of the field of view, where the mean correction is systematically $\sim$0.01 mag higher in Amp A for bluer filters (F275W, F336W, F438W) and $\sim$0.01 mag higher in Amp D for redder filters (F606W, F814W) at all focus levels. We test the new aperture correction maps in globular clusters, and we find reduced scatter, better agreement between the two CCDs, and a small shift in the absolute photometry when compared to a single (constant) aperture correction per image. These improvements are specific to photometry with apertures $&lt;$ 10 pixels in radius; results from larger apertures are not affected. Using published EE tables can introduce systematic uncertainties in absolute photometry due to its tendency to vary with detector position and focus level, with larger errors for smaller apertures. Users requiring photometric accuracy better than $\sim$1% for small apertures can use isolated stars in the individual FLT/FLC frames (or PSF cutouts at a similar detector position and focus level) to compute encircled energy corrections and accurately account for the amount of flux at radii larger than their photometric apertures.</description>

      <title>Separation of gain fluctuations and continuum signals in total power spectrometers with application to COMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a time-domain technique for separating $1/f$ gain fluctuations and continuum signal for a total power spectrometer, such as the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder instrument. The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of such a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the instrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum signal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode gain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a three-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data, separating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to the COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable resonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain degeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of Jupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show that the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum source, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two applications to COMAP. For the COMAP observations performing line intensity mapping (LIM), the technique better suppresses atmospheric fluctuations and foregrounds than the COMAP LIM pipeline. For the Galactic COMAP observations, which map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain fluctuations while retaining all continuum signals. This is demonstrated by the latest COMAP observations of $\lambda$-Orionis, where our method produces far cleaner maps than a destriper alone, typically reducing the noise power by a factor of 7 on beam scales and up to 15 on larger scales.</description>

      <title>Propellantless space exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propellantless propulsion refers to methods of space travel that do not require onboard propellant, instead relying on natural forces or external energy sources. In this paper, I review different approaches that have been explored and discuss the pros and cons of each method for interstellar space exploration.
  Gravitational assist uses planetary gravity to change a spacecraft's speed and direction without fuel. It is effective but limited to specific alignments.
  Solar sails harness radiation pressure from sunlight for continuous, fuel-free acceleration. While effective over time, they require large, reflective materials that degrade in space. Speed can be enhanced by thermal desorption triggered by solar radiation.
  Magnetic sails generate thrust by interacting with the solar wind through superconducting loops that produce a magnetic field. They provide lower acceleration compared to solar sails, and their performance depends on the available power and the variability of solar wind conditions.
  Electric sails utilize charged tethers to repel solar wind protons, producing gradual acceleration. Their effectiveness depends on the successful deployment of very long, lightweight conductive wires. They can achieve higher acceleration than solar sails, and their performance is influenced by available power and solar wind conditions.
  Lastly, quantum effects, such as the Casimir force, offer a speculative but intriguing route to propellantless propulsion based on the vacuum energy of space.</description>

Abstract: We search for ultra-light vector dark matter interacting with a rotating torsion balance with a baryon minus lepton number composition dipole. Our search spans candidate masses in the ultra-low mass range from 1.3~$\times10^{-22}$ to 1.9~$\times10^{-18}$ eV. We set limits on the coupling strength to baryon minus lepton number for each dark matter candidate reaching a peak sensitivity of $g_{B-L} \leq 9 \times 10^{-26}$.</description>

Abstract: In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Low-Latency Sky Localization in Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Earth Analogs in Reflected Light: Insights from Early Spectral Characterization in Unconstrained Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A next generation of space-based observatories aims to detect and characterize potentially Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars using reflected light spectroscopy. However, it remains unclear how such direct imaging observations$-$limited in spectral coverage and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)$-$translate into constraints on atmospheric composition and habitability. Coronagraphs used for high-contrast imaging typically operate over narrow bandpasses, and exposure time limits can restrict data quality. To optimize observing strategies and instrument design, we use our atmospheric retrieval tool, $\texttt{rfast}$, to assess the performance of a $\mathit{Habitable\ Worlds\ Observatory}$-type mission across different spectral bandpasses ("Red", "Blue", "Visible", "NIR", and their combination) and S/N levels (10, 15, and 20; from moderate to moderate-high observation quality) in retrieving a wide range of 17 atmospheric, surface, bulk, and orbital parameters of a habitable Earth analog. We outline the observation requirements for each parameter and the detection capabilities of each case, within a novel scenario where spectral data are taken "early", prior to achieving orbit constraints (which may require repeat visits to a system). For coronagraph-restricted and NIR-only bandpasses, most of the limited retrievable information is already captured at S/N = 10, with little improvement at higher S/N. For broader spectral coverage, the quality and quantity of retrieved information improve with increasing S/N, but combining visible and NIR ranges provides the most comprehensive characterization, even at moderate S/N. To maximize returns, wider spectral coverage should be prioritized over improving S/N when spectral access is limited.</description>

      <title>Zernike Mode Sorting with Vortex Phase Filters: Perfect Coronagraphs and Ideal Wavefront Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial mode sorting has come to prominence as an optical processing modality capable of saturating fundamental limits to numerous sensing tasks including wavefront sensing, coronagraphy, and superresolution imaging. But despite their promising theoretical advantages, contemporary mode sorters often feature large crosstalk, high loss, or sort modes that are poorly adapted to conventional imaging systems (e.g., Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss). Here, we introduce an alternative architecture that sorts spatial modes natural to circularly symmetric apertures: Zernike polynomials. Using conventional optics hardware and even-order vortex phase plates, we show how to assemble a series of vortex phase filters that can in principle separate the various Zernike polynomials losslessly and without crosstalk. This idea is demonstrated via application to wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, where we propose an optical system that saturates the quantum sensitivity limits to both tasks. We expect our work to prove useful for high-contrast imaging of extrasolar planets, improving both wavefront control and coronagraph performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency on transit light-curves: A correction strategy for PLATO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than $2\%$ via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardize this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assess and quantify the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and develop a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we model the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and use least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times $\tau_{r,k}$. Smearing is modeled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We model the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients $a_{p,k}$, the well-fill power index $\beta$, and the release times $\tau_{r,k}$ are adjusted via iterative application of the Extended pixel Edge Response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induces a bias of about $4\%$ in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of $0.06\%$ after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derive a correction scheme that brings photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.</description>

      <title>K-DRIFT: Unveiling New Imagery of the Hidden Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures play a crucial role in understanding galaxy evolution by providing significant insights into galaxy interactions, the histories of mass assembly, and the distribution of dark matter. Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features. The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Open-Source High-Fidelity Orbit Estimation for Planetary Science and Space Situational Awareness Using the Tudat Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a free open-source software suite for research and education in astrodynamics. Initially focused on numerical simulations of orbital dynamics and state estimation, it enables combining optical and radiometric tracking data from multiple sources to estimate the dynamics and parameters of natural and artificial bodies. Recent developments have added functionality for real tracking data analysis, with applications to planetary missions and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Tudat currently supports processing of (i) deep-space Doppler and range data from DSN and ESTRACK, (ii) Doppler and VLBI data from the PRIDE experiment, and (iii) optical astrometry from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and Natural Satellite Data Center (NSDC). Using tracking data from the MRO and GRAIL spacecraft and astrometric data of the asteroid Eros, we present prefit residuals (from SPICE-based observables) and postfit residuals (from fitting data to the Tudat dynamical model). Postfit Doppler residuals reach 1-5 mHz for MRO and GRAIL, orbit differences are a few meters for GRAIL and about one meter for MRO, and MRO range residuals are a few meters. From eight years of Eros astrometry, we obtain an orbit difference from the JPL Horizons solution by several tens of kilometers, consistent with its 3-sigma formal error. Tudat's SSA capability is demonstrated by propagating the orbit of Kosmos 482, a Venus lander launched in 1972 that remained in Earth orbit, over 50 years, including its predicted re-entry on May 10 2025. These examples showcase Tudat's modular, flexible, high-fidelity modeling across diverse orbital regimes within a fully open-source framework. All example code is publicly available, and future Tudat analyses will be published with fully reproducible code, allowing anyone in the community to improve and expand upon our work.</description>

      <title>QUEST (Quasar Unsupervised Encoder and Synthesis Tool): A machine learning framework to generate quasar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars at the redshift frontier (z &gt; 7.0) are fundamental probes of black hole (BH) growth and evolution but notoriously difficult to identify. At these redshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be efficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full potential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of generating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating synthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q catalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data set. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent space to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a pipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with actual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in reconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully reproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By examining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric luminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties. When used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with the control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing emission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in good agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra with broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully interpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find excellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output of their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is capable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training set.</description>

      <title>Validation of field cage and cathode for low radioactivity operation with the CYGNO experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, which is considered to account for approximately the 27% of the Universe's energy-mass content, remains an open issue in modern particle physics along with its composition. The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.</description>

      <title>Automated Exploration of Radical-Molecule Chemistry: The Case of Oxirane + CH in the ISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (Skipper-CCDs) are ultra-low-threshold detectors capable of detecting energy deposits in silicon at the eV scale. Increasingly used in rare-event searches, one of the major challenges in these experiments is mitigating low-energy backgrounds. In this work, we present results on trap characterization in a silicon Skipper-CCD produced in the same fabrication run as the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB. Lattice defects contribute to backgrounds in rare-event searches through single-electron charge trapping. To investigate this, we employ the charge-pumping technique at different temperatures to identify dipoles produced by traps in the CCD channel. We fully characterize a fraction of these traps and use this information to extrapolate their contribution to the single-electron background in SENSEI. We find that this subpopulation of traps does not contribute significantly but more work is needed to assess the impact of the traps that can not be characterized.</description>

      <title>Unveiling stellar (and planetary) internal dynamics with the fully compressible MUSIC code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations have transformed the study of stellar interiors over the past few decades. Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.</description>

      <title>Scheduling multiple agile Earth observation satellites with multiple observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.00203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth observation satellites (EOSs) are specially designed to collect images according to user requirements. The agile EOSs (AEOS), with stronger attitude maneuverability, greatly improve the observation capability, while increasing the complexity in scheduling. We address a multiple AEOSs scheduling with multiple observations for the first time}, where the objective function aims to maximize the entire observation profit over a fixed horizon. The profit attained by multiple observations for each target is nonlinear to the number of observations. We model the multiple AEOSs scheduling as a specific interval scheduling problem with each satellite orbit respected as machine. Then A column generation based framework is developed to solve this problem, in which we deal with the pricing problems with a label-setting algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted on the basis of a China's AEOS constellation, and the results indicate the optimality gap is less than 3% on average, which validates the performance of the scheduling solution obtained by the proposed framework. We also compare the framework in the conventional EOS scheduling.</description>

      <title>SAMPLE -- Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence -- A Method of Collection of Stratospheric Samples Using Balloon-Borne Payload System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.</description>

      <title>Stellar halo subtraction alternative for accreting companions' characterization with integral field spectroscopy: Analytical and on-sky demonstration on the PDS70, HTLup, and YSES1 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&amp;K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.</description>

      <title>CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Close-in faint companions mimicking interferometric hot exozodiacal dust observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Interferometric observations of various nearby main-sequence stars show an unexpected infrared excess, raising the question of its origin. The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Assessing the feasibility range of Solar-powered Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work aims to assess principal physical technical constraints of the key technological concept for achieving maximal carrying capacity expansive potential of Planetary Systems. Chemical composition of most potential Biosphere Substrates is in most cases very far from optimal for full-scale habitability thus productivity potential realization. To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher. The farther planetesimal is orbiting from a star the more time but less energy is required for its delivery. The more distant from a star, the more rich in volatiles planetesimals are. The most technically detailed and feasible scheme to date of Planetesimals Redirection was proposed in 1993 by Dr. Zubrin based on NTRs. Nuclear fuel is extremely scarce and might be the principal limiting factor for final stages of interstellar colonization missions. We investigate possibilities of using concentrated beamed solar power Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming as it can increase the possible scale of such operations to orders of magnitude. Such a mission might consist of Planetesimal Tug Spacecraft Systems (PTSS) to redirect a planetesimal, and solar Power Harvesting Beaming System (PHBS) tracking the spacecraft with a beam to power it. We found Solarpowered Planetesimals Redirection for Terraforming is feasible within Kuiper Belt with present technologies.</description>

      <title>GWKokab: An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>
