      <title>New Bounds on Heavy QCD Axions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4 abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe, because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV. Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and multi-decay signatures from dark showers at beam-dump experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models of strongly-interacting dark sectors, the production of dark quarks at accelerators can give rise to dark showers with multiple dark mesons in the final state. If some of these dark mesons are sufficiently light and long-lived, they can be detected with searches for displaced vertices at beam-dump experiments and electron-positron colliders. In this work we focus on the case that dark quark production proceeds via effective operators, while the dark sector analogue of the $\rho^0$ meson can decay via kinetic mixing. We evaluate current constraints from NA62 and BaBar as well as sensitivity projections for SHiP and Belle II. We find that there exists a sizable parameter region where SHiP may detect several displaced vertices in a single event and thus obtain valuable information about the structure of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Anarchic neutrinos from flavor deconstruction: phenomenology of the lepton sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino sector in the framework of flavor deconstruction with an inverse-seesaw realization. This setup naturally links the hierarchical charged-fermion masses to the anarchic pattern of light-neutrino mixing. We determine the viable parameter space consistent with oscillation data and study the phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons (HNL) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) processes. Current bounds from direct HNL searches and LFV decays constrain the right-handed neutrino scale to a few TeV, while future $\mu \to e$ experiments will probe most of the region with $\Lambda \lesssim 10~\text{TeV}$. Among possible realizations, models deconstructing $\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{B-L}$ or $\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{R} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{B-L}$ are those allowing the lowest deconstruction scale.</description>

      <title>Delayed Charged Lepton Yukawa Equilibration and Thermal Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most studies of the minimal type-I seesaw neglect the heaviest decoupled right-handed neutrino, assuming negligible contributions to neutrino masses and leptogenesis, we demonstrate that its cosmological role can be significant. When long-lived, this particle substantially modifies the charged lepton Yukawa equilibration temperature in the early universe, necessitating reassessment of lepton flavor effects in thermal leptogenesis and potentially shifting flavor regime boundaries. We identify experimental probes through neutrino oscillation measurements and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$. Such an interpretation requires dynamics beyond the Standard Model in this energy range. If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds. This scenario is also suggestive of a low-mass seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino masses. We outline the prospects for future observations of Galactic supernovae to uncover the signals of this scenario, which could get further confirmation with additional pulsar timing array data establishing the primordial origin of the observed nano-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraining $A\to ZH$ with $H\to t\bar t$ in the Low-Mass Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay $A\to ZH$ is a characteristic signal of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), where $A$ and $H$ lie primarily within the same $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, leading to a coupling of order $g_2$ to the $Z$ boson. The subsequent decay $H \to tt^{(*)}$ is particularly promising, as it gives rise to distinct final states involving multiple leptons and $b$-jets. The required splitting between $m_A$ and $m_H$ can naturally occur near the electroweak scale while being consistent with perturbative unitarity. Whereas dedicated ATLAS and CMS searches focused on the region with both top-quarks on-shell, we cover lower masses where one top quark is off-shell by recasting Standard Model $t\bar{t}Z$ measurements of ATLAS and CMS. The obtained limits on $\sigma(A\to ZH)\times {\rm Br} (H\to t\bar t)$ are between $0.12$ pb and $0.62$ pb. When interpreted within the type-I 2HDM, a sizable part of the so far unconstrained low-mass region is excluded. Interestingly, we observe these stringent limits despite a preference (up to $2.5\sigma$) for a non-zero new physics signal, most pronounced around for $m_A \approx 450-460$ GeV and $m_H\approx 290$ GeV, with a best-fit value of $\sigma(A \to ZH) \times {\rm Br}(H \to t\bar t) \approx 0.3$ pb. This cross section can be accommodated within a top-philic 2HDM for a top-Yukawa coupling of the second Higgs doublet of $\mu_t \gtrsim 0.16$.</description>

      <title>String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.</description>

      <title>WIMP Shadows: Phenomenology of Secluded Dark Matter in Three Minimal BSM Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of secluded dark matter (DM) $\chi$, where the relic abundance is set by annihilations into lighter dark mediators $\phi$ that couple only feebly to the Standard Model (SM). In contrast to canonical WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches, secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\chi$ whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and a coupled $\chi$-$\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\epsilon$ required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\epsilon \ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the irreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak due to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra controlled by $\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider tests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-information-theoretic observables in electron-proton scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our analysis focuses on entanglement and magic, two complementary indicators of non-classicality in quantum states. We show that while unpolarized and longitudinally polarized beams yield unentangled separable outcomes, transverse beam polarization enables the generation of entangled and non-stabilizer states. This result holds for both elastic and deep inelastic electron-proton scattering in QED. In the deep inelastic regime, the degree of quantum correlation is governed by the transversity parton distribution functions, providing a novel perspective on spin dynamics within QCD. These results establish the EIC as a promising environment for generating entangled and non-stabilizer states in high-energy physics, and they highlight opportunities for future lepton-hadron colliders to extend such studies into new kinematic domains.</description>

      <title>Towards theory constraints on ultralight dark matter from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>The Feynman path integral formulation of non-dispersive Airy wave packets and their applications to the heavy meson mass spectra and ultra-cold neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the non-spreading behavior of Airy wave packets utilizing the Feynman path integral formulation of a linear potential, the Airy functions' zeros correspondence to heavy-meson mass spectroscopy, and their implications to the eigenstates of ultra-cold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field. We derive the linear kernel, and utilize the Feynman path integral time evolution to show that Airy function wave packets are non-dispersive in free space. We then model the confining contribution to 1S - 2S heavy meson mass gaps as a 1+1D absolute linear potential and look at the correspondence of the Airy function zeros. In doing so, we predicted the confining contribution to the mass gap of heavy mesons with a good accuracy when compared to calculations performed in the light front. Furthermore, we used these Airy function solutions to model the quantum states of a neutron under Earth's gravity. We show that the measured heights of a neutron can be modeled by the zeros of the Airy function, and compare to experimental data and predictions utilizing the WKB approximation.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Constraints on Pion Valence Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profile of the pion valence quark distribution function (DF) remains controversial. Working from the concepts of QCD effective charges and generalised parton distributions, we show that since the pion elastic electromagnetic form factor is well approximated by a monopole, then, at large light-front momentum fraction, the pion valence quark DF is a convex function described by a large-$x$ power law that is practically consistent with expectations based on quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation and Multimessenger Signals in a Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) induced by a first-order electroweak phase transition in a realistic renormalizable framework, the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model. We perform a quantitative analysis of the PBH abundance and identify parameter regions consistent with current microlensing constraints. Furthermore, we show that the same parameter space predicts observable stochastic gravitational waves within the sensitivities of future space-based detectors, as well as a sizable deviation in the Higgs triple coupling that can be probed at future lepton colliders. Our results highlight a comprehensive multimessenger framework in which PBH, gravitational wave, and collider observations can jointly test the dynamics of a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>OmniLearned: A Foundation Model Framework for All Tasks Involving Jet Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models use large datasets to build an effective representation of data that can be deployed on diverse downstream tasks. Previous research developed the OmniLearn foundation model for jet physics, using unique properties of particle physics, and showed that it could significantly advance discovery potential across collider experiments. This paper introduces a major upgrade, resulting in the OmniLearned framework. This framework has three new elements: (1) updates to the model architecture and training, (2) using over one billion jets used for training, and (3) providing well-documented software for accessing all datasets and models. We demonstrate OmniLearned with three representative tasks: top-quark jet tagging with the community Delphes-based benchmark dataset, b-tagging with ATLAS full simulation, and anomaly detection with CMS experimental data. In each case, OmniLearned is the state of the art, further expanding the discovery potential of past, current, and future collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief overview of analytical QCD, focusing primarily on a less common form of the analytical coupling A_{\rm MA}(Q^2), which is particularly convenient for Q^2\sim\Lambda^2. This form has been extensively used in recent studies of the (polarized) Bjorken sum rule and the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived axion-like particles via displaced vertices at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated extensions of the standard model (SM) that appear in numerous new physics scenarios. In this paper, we concentrate on searches for long-lived ALPs predicted by the photophobic scenario at the HL-LHC with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ $3$ ab$^{-1}$. We consider the process $pp \to \gamma a$ with the ALP $a$ decaying into a pair of displaced charged leptons and perform a detailed analysis of two types of signals: $\pi^+ \pi^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ and $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$. For the $\pi^+ \pi^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ signal, we find that the prospective sensitivities of the HL-LHC can reach $g_{aWW}\in [8.72 \times 10^{-3}, 6.42 \times 10^{-2}]$ TeV$^{-1}$ for the ALP mass $m_a \in [4, 10]$ GeV. While for the $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ signal, the HL-LHC can probe a broader parameter space, with the sensitivities covering $m_a \in [4, 10]$ GeV and $g_{aWW} \in [4.17 \times 10^{-3}, 2.00 \times 10^{-1}]$ TeV$^{-1}$. These long-lived searches complement some previous prompt decay studies from LEP and LHC experiments, extending the parameter space explored by the LHCb collaboration. Our results show that the HL-LHC has significant potential to probe long-lived ALPs via their displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>A Viable New Model for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model of the dark sector involving Dirac fermion dark matter, with axial coupling to a dark photon which provides a portal to Standard Model particles. In the non-relativistic limit, this implies that the dominant effective operator relevant to direct detection is ${\cal O}_8$. The resulting event rate for direct detection is suppressed by either the dark matter velocity or the momentum transfer. In this scenario there are much wider regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with all of the existing constraints associated with thermal relic density, direct detection and collider searches.</description>

      <title>Diffractive deep inelastic scattering in the dipole picture: the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution in exact kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to the diffractive structure functions in high-energy deep inelastic scattering. The obtained result corresponds to a finite part of the next-to-leading-order contribution to the diffractive cross section. Previous phenomenological applications have included this contribution only in the high-$Q^2$ or high-$M_X^2$ limits in the case of a soft gluon, and we numerically demonstrate that these existing estimates do not provide a good approximation for the full $q\bar{q}g$ contribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to the soft gluon contribution, there is an equally important soft quark contribution to the diffractive structure functions at high $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>

      <title>Probing the existence of a new charged vector boson decaying into heavy neutral leptons using ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions at ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the potential of Ultra-peripheral Collisions in the LHC to investigate new physics, focusing specifically on the production of new charged vector bosons ${V}^{\pm}$ that decay into heavy neutral leptons $N_{L}$ in the context of the Vector Scotogenic Model. We show that the ATLAS experiment searching for dilepton+met final states through UPCs of lead ions, can prove the existence of new charged vector bosons in the mass range 5-100 GeV, a region not explored by the LEP-II experiment. Our analysis identifies regions in the parameter space where the signal can be distinguished from the background with high statistical significance. Within the mass range 5 GeV $&lt;M_{V^{\pm}}, M_{N_L}&lt;$ 100 GeV, ATLAS can exclude scenarios with 95\% of C.L. for specific mass scenarios such as (30 GeV, 20 GeV), (30 GeV, 10 GeV) and (20 GeV, 10 GeV). In a discovery context, ATLAS could reach a significance of 5$\sigma$ only for (20 GeV, 10 GeV). Furthermore, we show that in the absence of new physics signals at ATLAS, the High Luminosity LHC with UPCs of protons could explore further into larger mass ranges, specifically 100 GeV $&lt; M_{V^{\pm}}&lt;$ 200 GeV and 5 GeV $&lt;M_{N_L}&lt;$ 200 GeV. We find that the HL-LHC can exclude this mass range with 95\% of C.L., and most scenarios can achieve a discovery significance of 5$\sigma$</description>

Abstract: An effective model is introduced to illustrate finite volume effects beyond the usual momentum space constraints. The fluctuations of the chiral order parameter and the net baryon number, as well as their scaling properties, are investigated near a critical point and a first-order transition in finite size systems. The finite volume effects on the kurtosis are shown in detail along the approximate freeze-out line. Several implications of the finite volume in the charge fluctuations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of heavy-flavor hadrons in association with a vector boson in proton-proton collisions is a powerful probe for studying Quantum Chromodynamics and the content of protons. In this article, we provide, for the first time, differential predictions through NNLO for the production of $W^{\pm}D^{(*)\mp}$ final states. The results are compared to recent ATLAS measurements, and the sensitivity to the strange content of the proton is investigated by PDF profiling. The results are found to be promising for including $W^{\pm}D^{(*)\mp}$ measurements in proton-proton collisions in PDF fits.</description>

      <title>Dijets with large rapidity separation at the next-to-leading BFKL for search of large extra dimension gravity at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search for the large extra dimension gravity at collider energies is considered in trans-Planckian eikonal regime, i. e., when $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D \gg \sqrt{-\hat{t}}$. Here $\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$ are the Mandelstam variables of colliding parton-parton system and $M_D$ is the Planck mass scale in the space-time with compactified $n_D$ extra dimensions. The main observable of the large extra dimension gravity in trans-Planckian eikonal regime is a cross section of high mass ($M_{jj}\sim\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D$) dijet production with large rapidity separation. In the trans-Planckian eikonal regime the Gribov-Regge limit of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) ($\sqrt{s}\gg\sqrt{-t}\gg\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$) is the main source of the standard model background. The calculation of the QCD background should be done within the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximation of Lipatov-Fadin-Kuraev-Balitsky (BFKL) formalism. In this work the signal of the large extra dimension gravity as well as the NLL BFKL QCD background are estimated for the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and future colliders such as FCCpp and CEPC-SppC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling $\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim \xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss implications for late time relics such as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Prospects for a 95 GeV Higgs Boson at Future Higgs Factories with Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several experimental analyses have reported mild excesses near 95\,GeV that could indicate the presence of a light Higgs-like scalar. We study the phenomenology of such a state within the flipped Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM-F) at the proposed Circular Electron--Positron Collider (CEPC). The light scalar $S$ is investigated through the Higgsstrahlung process $e^+e^- \to Z(\mu^+\mu^-)S$ with $S\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and $S\to b \bar{b}$ decay modes. A full Monte Carlo simulation including detector effects is performed to estimate the discovery reach and precision measurement potential. To maximize the sensitivity, we employ particle-level transformer networks (ParT and MIParT) that exploit correlations among all reconstructed objects. Compared with a cut-based baseline, improves the expected measurement precision by a factor of 2.4 in the $\tau\tau$ channel and 1.4 in the $b b$ channel. %of data at 240\,GeV. For viable benchmark points in the N2HDM-F, the attainable precisions on the signal rate reach 1.0\% and 0.63\%, respectively. Interpreted in a model-independent framework, the CEPC can achieve a 5$\sigma$ discovery for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;1.6\times10^{-2}$ and $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;4.2\times10^{-3}$, and reach a 1\% precision for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;0.96$ and $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;0.13$. These results highlight the potential of particle-level machine learning techniques in extending the light-Higgs exploration program at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A paradigmatic model, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark-matter halos with anisotropic velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense quark matter.
  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).
  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities, deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.</description>

      <title>Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that "color" emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label--a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970--78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering--performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Energy of 2+1-flavor dense quark matter from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion was developed to connect isospin symmetric matter probed in nuclear experiments to asymmetric matter found in neutron stars. Using the isospin asymmetry derived from the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, we derive the symmetry energy expansion for quark matter that has unique properties compared to hadronic matter. To test our methods, we use perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading-order, where realistic quark masses can be included. We find that pQCD at electroweak equilibrium is not isospin symmetric but rather obtains a small skewness term in the symmetry energy expansion. We predict that if equations of state for nuclear matter must match pQCD results, then a non-monotonic dip in the symmetry energy would appear.</description>

      <title>Definition and Treatment of Systematic Uncertainties in High Energy Physics and Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic uncertainties in high energy physics and astrophysics are often significant contributions to the overall uncertainty in a measurement, in many cases being comparable to the statistical uncertainties. However, consistent definition and practice is elusive, as there are few formal definitions and there exists significant ambiguity in what is defined as a systematic and statistical uncertainty in a given analysis. I will describe current practice, and recommend a definition and classification of systematic uncertainties that allows one to treat these sources of uncertainty in a consistent and robust fashion. Classical and Bayesian approaches will be contrasted.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration for the Dirac spectrum in finite-temperature gauge theories in the two-flavor chiral limit, using Ginsparg--Wilson fermions on the lattice. I prove that chiral symmetry is restored at the level of the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears if and only if all these susceptibilities do not diverge in the chiral limit $m\to 0$, with $m$ the common mass of the light fermions. This implies in turn that they are infinitely differentiable functions of $m^2$ at $m=0$, or $m$ times such a function, depending on whether they contain an even or odd number of isosinglet bilinears. Expressing scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities in terms of the Dirac spectrum, I use their finiteness in the symmetric phase to derive constraints on the spectrum, and discuss the resulting implications for the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry in the chiral limit. I also discuss the differentiability properties of spectral quantities with respect to $m^2$, and show from first principles that the topological properties of the theory in the chiral limit are characterized by an instanton gas-like behavior if $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ remains effectively broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the consequences of the constraints imposed on the Dirac spectrum by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the chiral limit of gauge theories with two light fermion flavors, with particular attention to the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry. Under general, physically motivated assumptions on the spectral density and on the two-point eigenvalue correlation function, I show that effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase requires specific spectral features, including a spectral density effectively behaving as $m^2\delta(\lambda)$ in the chiral limit, a two-point function singular at zero, and delocalized near-zero modes, besides an instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. I then discuss a $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|\lambda|$ in the chiral limit and by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable mechanism for effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^- - n$ Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi claim that both the spectral density of the Dirac operator at the origin and the topological susceptibility must vanish identically for sufficiently small but nonzero mass $m$ in the chirally symmetric phase of QCD with two light quark flavors, under certain technical assumptions on the spectrum and on the dependence of observables on $m$. Independently of these assumptions, I argue that a crucial step of their proof is not justified, and the validity of these conclusions should be reassessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Low-lying baryon resonances from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the properties of baryon resonances from quantum chromodynamics requires evaluating the temporal correlations between hadronic operators using integrations over field configurations weighted by a phase associated with the action. By formulating quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice in imaginary time, such integrations can be carried out non-perturbatively using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling. The energies of stationary states in the finite volume of the lattice can be extracted from the temporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best-fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those that produce a finite-volume spectrum which most closely matches that obtained from the Monte Carlo computations. Results for the $\Delta$ resonance are presented, and a study of scattering for energies near the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance is outlined, showing a two pole structure. The prospects for applying this methodology to the Roper resonance are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the soft behavior of QCD amplitudes involving multiple Wilson lines and derive compact analytic expressions for double soft gluon and double soft quark emissions at one loop. The color correlations of the soft current exhibit a predominantly dipole structure, coupling to two hard legs at a time, apart from an abelian contribution that factorizes into products of one-loop and tree-level single soft currents, which may involve up to three hard legs. The kinematic dependence of the one-loop soft currents is expressed in terms of polylogarithmic functions, with explicit results presented for time-like kinematics. We further discuss the analytic continuation to other kinematic configurations and identify non-trivial crossing effects when continuing into incoming states. The squared amplitude is found to be invariant under crossing, which implies that the fully differential soft function and in particular the TMD soft function, remains universal up to three loops.</description>

      <title>NuFit-6.0: Updated global analysis of three-flavor neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated global analysis of neutrino oscillation data as of September 2024. The parameters $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, and $|\Delta m^2_{3\ell}|$ ($\ell = 1,2$) are well-determined with relative precision at $3\sigma$ of about 13\%, 8\%, 15\%, and 6\%, respectively. The third mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ still suffers from the octant ambiguity, with no clear indication of whether it is larger or smaller than $45^\circ$. The determination of the leptonic CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ depends on the neutrino mass ordering: for normal ordering the global fit is consistent with CP conservation within $1\sigma$, whereas for inverted ordering CP-violating values of $\delta_{CP}$ around $270^\circ$ are favored against CP conservation at more than $3.6\sigma$. While the present data has in principle $2.5$--$3\sigma$ sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, there are different tendencies in the global data that reduce the discrimination power: T2K and NOvA appearance data individually favor normal ordering, but they are more consistent with each other for inverted ordering. Conversely, the joint determination of $|\Delta m^2_{3\ell}|$ from global disappearance data prefers normal ordering. Altogether, the global fit including long-baseline, reactor and IceCube atmospheric data results into an almost equally good fit for both orderings. Only when the $\chi^2$ table for atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande is added to our $\chi^2$, the global fit prefers normal ordering with $\Delta\chi^2 = 6.1$. We provide also updated ranges and correlations for the effective parameters sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass from $\beta$-decay, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM, which mixes only with the Standard Model (SM) third-generation up-type quark, predominantly decays into a top quark and a dark photon pair. The dark photon then promptly decays to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, (i) exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet, and (ii) at least two tagged dark photons and at least one tagged top quark jet at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, i.e., the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $\sim 2.3$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the final state with exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <title>On axion properties in the 3-3-1 model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ and Peccei-Quinn symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn ($PQ$) mechanism is applied to the $\mathrm{SU(3)_c \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X}$ model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. The structures in the $PQ$ charges of all fermions and scalar fields in the model are investigated by applying the invariant condition under the symmetry group transformations on all Yukawa interaction terms. All defined $PQ$ charges depend just on the $PQ$ charge of the complex singlet scalar field which causes the $U(1)_{PQ}$ spontaneous symmetry breaking in the model. The mixing and mass hierarchy in the scalar sector of the model are studied in detail. The constraints on the $PQ$ charges and imaginary parts of scalars are derived. It is shown that only neutral scalar fields carry $PQ$ charges while charged ones do not. As the result, the physical state of axion which obeys the invariance under $\mathrm{SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X}$ and $PQ$ transformations, is a linear combination of all imaginary parts associated with the $X$ charges of scalar triplets. The anomaly axion-fermion interactions are presented. Explicit expressions for axion and light Standard Model (SM) like Higgs boson are shown. Mass of the axion and its coupling to photon are derived. The decays of the SM-like Higgs boson into a pair of either charged leptons or bottom quarks are presented and constrained. The triple-coupling axion-photon-photon arisen from kinetic terms of scalar fields is derived. Hence, the decay of axion into a pair of photons consists of two parts: the first is related to the anomaly coupling and the second is come from kinetic terms of scalar fields. The result shows that the new contribution can be helpful for searching axion with mass at hundred keV.</description>

      <title>Aligned Zee-Grimus-Neufeld model for $(g-2)_\mu$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent result of the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment is still in conflict with the SM prediction if dispersive methods are used as input for the hadronic vacuum polarization. We seek models where the same set of mediators around the weak scale or above contribute to neutrino masses and to the muon $g-2$ through a chiral enhanced contribution. As family lepton number violation is inherent to the former, non-negligible charged lepton flavor violation will be induced. We arrive at the following field content additional to the SM: one Higgs doublet, one singly charged scalar and one righthanded neutrino. Neutrino masses will be generated by a combination of mechanisms: tree-level seesaw, Zee mechanism and Grimus-Neufeld mechanism while lepton flavor violation will be minimized by considering Yukawa aligned Higgs doublets. The setting is flexible enough to account for $(g-2)_\mu$, the Cabibbo angle anomaly and the $W$ mass deviation while avoiding dangerous CLFV.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mixing parameters and masses from $\Delta(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive model independent analysis of all breaking patterns resulting from $\Delta(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach of the minimal seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos. The three generations of left-handed lepton doublets are assumed to transform as the irreducible triplet $\bm{3_{0}}$ of $\Delta(96)$, and the two right-handed neutrinos are assigned to singlets. In the case that both flavon fields $\phi_{\text{atm}}$ and $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ transform as triplet $\bm{\bar{3}_{0}}$, only one phenomenologically viable lepton mixing pattern is obtained for normal ordering neutrino masses. The lepton mixing matrix is predicted to be the TM1 pattern, with neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP violation phases depending on only three real input parameters. When $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ is assigned to the $\bm{\bar{3}_{1}}$ representation, an additional real parameter $x$ must be included. Then we find 42 (12) independent phenomenologically interesting mixing patterns for normal (inverted) ordering neutrino masses, and the corresponding predictions for lepton mixing parameters and neutrino masses are obtained. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis for five (one) example breaking patterns with some benchmark values of $x$ for normal (inverted) ordering. For the five normal examples, the absolute values of the first columns of the PMNS matrix are fixed to be $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{17},2,2\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{38}}\left(5,2,3\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{57}}\left(\sqrt{37},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{10}\right)^{T}$ and $\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt{6},1,\sqrt{2}\right)^{T}$, respectively. For the inverted example, the absolute value of the third column of the PMNS matrix is $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{11}}\left(1,5,3\sqrt{2}\right)^{T}$.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD calculation of hadron multiplicities in light-quark jets at lepton colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the calculation of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections to hadron multiplicities in light-quark jets at lepton colliders, employing the ``projection-to-Born" (P2B) method implemented in the FMNLO program. Taking the next-to-leading-order result as an example, we rigorously establish the validity of our P2B-based calculation. We then present NNLO predictions for the normalized asymmetry $D_{K^{-}}$ between hadron and antihadron production in light-quark jets and compare them with SLD data. We find that a suppression of these SLD measurements relative to NPC23 predictions for $D_{K^{-}}$ emerges in the intermediate $z_h$ domain ($0.2 \lesssim z_h \lesssim 0.7$). We expect that incorporating these SLD data into global QCD fits will enable improved determination of fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violating Higgs Decays in a Minimal Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model with an Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyse the lepton flavor violation (LFV) decays within the framework of the Doublet Left-Right Symmetric model (DLRSM), based on the gauge group SU\left(2\right)_{L}\otimes SU\left(2\right)_{R}\otimes U\left(1\right)_{B-L}. The model features an extended gauge and scalar sector, including a bidoublet and two doublets which induce new charged currents interactions. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) occurs in two stages, introducing a new scale associated with the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the right-handed doublet v_{R} assumed to lie above the electroweak scale. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, allowing sizeable mixing between active and sterile neutrinos. We diagonalize the full neutrino mass matrix and express the mixing in terms of physical parameters. We compute the branching ratios for LFV Higgs decays as functions of the heavy neutrino mass scale. Our numerical analysis incorporates current experimental bounds and projected sensitivities, highlighting viable regions of parameter space where LFV signals could be observed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>A $Z_4$ scotogenic model with a Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Scotogenic type model based on a global $Z_4$ symmetry involving dark matter candidates. After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.</description>

      <title>Shower formation in the presence of a string-inspired foam in space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study confinement and deconfinement in dense two color QCD by analyzing the dynamics of thermal quarks and gluons. The Polyakov loop is used as a probe of the relevant thermal excitations, distinguishing quark and hadron dominated regimes in dense matter. To describe the Polyakov loop, we adopt both lattice informed phenomenological models and the massive Yang Mills framework. After calibrating these models at zero density, we investigate in medium modifications of the Polyakov loops and gluon propagators at finite temperature and density. Diquark gaps control the screening at zero temperature, whereas the screening due to thermal quarks is sensitive to the Polyakov loop. Inclusion of the Polyakov loop helps to reproduce lattice data at low temperature, suggesting that thermal excitations are predominantly hadronic rather than uncorrelated quarks.</description>

      <title>Study of the Semileptonic Decay $\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of the semileptonic decay process \(\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\), focusing on the determination of all six vector and axial-vector form factors that govern the low-energy hadronic matrix elements of the underlying theory. These invariant form factors constitute the essential inputs for describing the decay, and their dependence on the momentum transfer \(q^{2}\) is analyzed across the entire physical kinematic region. To parameterize the \(q^{2}\)-dependence, we adopt both the \(z\)-expansion formalism and a polynomial fitting approach. Utilizing these parameterizations, we compute the exclusive decay widths for both the electron and muon channels and subsequently extract the corresponding branching ratios. Furthermore, we evaluate the ratio of decay widths between the muon and electron channels, defined as $R^{\mu e} \equiv \frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,\mu\,\bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,e\,\bar{\nu}_{e})}$, obtaining \(R^{\mu e} = 0.196^{+0.009}_{-0.012}\) from the polynomial fit and \(R^{\mu e} = 0.174^{+0.002}_{-0.005}\) from the \(z\)-expansion. While both ratios are compatible with previously reported values in the literature, the result from the \(z\)-expansion exhibits particularly strong agreement with the averages reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG).</description>

      <title>An improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ ($L$ denotes the light ground state pseudoscalar, vector mesons and the corresponding $p$-wave scalar, axial-vector, and tensor ones) and predict their branching ratios (BRs) associated with relative ratios at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. Our results ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+) =(2.03^{+0.53}_{-0.41}) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 1.74^{+0.66}_{-0.50}$ are consistent with several available predictions in different approaches within uncertainties. Inputting the measured $\eta_c \to p\bar p$ and $\eta_c \to \pi^+\pi^- (\pi^+\pi^-, K^+ K^-, p\bar p)$ BRs with $p$ here being a proton, we derive the multibody $B_c^+ \to \eta_c (\pi, \rho)^+$ BRs through secondary decay chains via resonance $\eta_c$ under the narrow-width approximation, which might facilitate the (near) future tests of $B_c \to \eta_c$ decays. Under the $q\bar q$ assignment for light scalars, different to $B_c$ decaying into $J/\psi$ plus a scalar meson and other $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ modes, surprisingly small $\Delta S =0$ BRs around ${\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-9})$ and highly large ratios near ${\cal O}(10^{2})$ between the $\Delta S=1$ and $\Delta S=0$ BRs are found in the $B_c$ decays to $\eta_c$ plus light scalars, with $S$ being strange number. Many large BRs and interesting ratios presented in this work could be tested by the Large Hadron Collider experiments, which would help us to examine the reliability of this improved perturbative QCD formalism for $B_c$-meson decays and further understand the QCD dynamics in the considered decay modes, as well as in the related hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium $(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\ (-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$ contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta + \eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 17^{\circ}$ for the minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of 2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this papar, we study the production and decay of a charged Higgs boson, a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, and a $Z'$ boson at the LHC within the flavor-dependent model (FDM), at the LHC. Considering the constraints from perturbative unitarity and experimental measurements (e.g., the flavor physics data, higgs signal strengths, electroweak precision observables), we investigate the relevant processes by analyzing several common LHC search channels. Motivated by the excess in $t \to b\bar{b}c$ reported by ATLAS, which suggests a charged Higgs boson with a mass near 130 GeV and consistent with B-anomaly expectations, we perform a dedicated simulation for a charged Higgs around this mass. Our results support the experimental hint and predict that this particle has a high discovery potential at the future High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In contrast, for the pseudoscalar and $Z'$ bosons predicted in our model, they remain beyond the reach of current experiments as well as the expected sensitivity at a 14 TeV collider with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The DNA of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement Genetic Algorithms for triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes which induce Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces via Batyrev's construction. We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.</description>

      <title>The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for XLZD, the next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. In the baseline design, the detector will have an active liquid xenon target of 60 tonnes, which could be increased to 80 tonnes if the market conditions for xenon are favorable. It is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology used in current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. The report discusses the baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm\,cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory will also have leading sensitivity to a wide range of alternative dark matter models. It is projected to have a 3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the sun and galactic supernovae.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newton's bucket: Active and passive rotations in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Apparent $w&lt;-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

      <title>On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generic expressions for the integrands of canonical bases under maximal cut in elliptic Feynman integral families with multiple kinematic scales. Such integrals frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The derivation of our results starts from the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric properties of the curves are simple and explicit, and further kinematic singularities are presented as marked points. The simplicity of the normal form allows a straightforward construction of canonical bases with an arbitrary number of marked points. They can then be mapped into any univariate elliptic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation, leading to universal expressions for the integrands. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, including two new integral families whose canonical bases were not available in the literature. In several examples, we derive canonical bases for the full integral families without any cuts, demonstrating the simplicity of the sub-sector dependence of our canonical bases.</description>

      <title>Learning about neutron star composition from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass-radius curve, $dM/dR$, is studied to understand the information it may carry about the composition of neutron stars, particularly with regard to the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. This study uses two large sets of relativistic mean-field equations of state with either nucleonic or nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom, and imposes constraints obtained from GW170817 and the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. It is shown that: i) some mass-radius curves are characterized by a negative slope from one solar mass up to the maximum mass; ii) other equations of state (EoS) have a positive slope for a given range of masses below the maximum star mass. Within the set of models considered, the first set includes only a very small number of hyperonic EoS: less than 0.5\% of the total number of hyperonic stars and approximately one third of the nucleonic EoS. We have also analyzed the sign of the slope for neutron star masses of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8$M_\odot$. Only approximately 1\% of hyperonic equations of state (EoS) predict a negative slope for 1.4$M_\odot$ stars, whereas over 90\% of nucleonic stars have a negative slope at this mass. Finally, almost all stars have a negative slope at 1.8$M_\odot$. A positive slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ may indicate the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom within neutron stars. The nuclear matter property that distinguishes the different scenarios most clearly is the curvature of the symmetry energy. Nucleonic EoSs with a positive slope $dM/dR$ predict the highest values, which can exceed 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis and Analytic Continuation of Scattering Amplitudes from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel procedure for analyzing the lattice-QCD spectrum via the finite-volume formalism to obtain constraints on multi-hadron scattering amplitudes at both real and complex energies. This approach combines a Bayesian reconstruction of the scattering amplitude on the real axis with Nevanlinna interpolation for analytic continuation to complex-valued energies. The method is non-parametric, inherently accounting for parametrization dependence within the uncertainty. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach using both toy data and real lattice-QCD data in resonant systems from the HadSpec and BaSc collaborations.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23156$\pm$0.00024, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>
