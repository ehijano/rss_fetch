      <title>Gait Disorder Assessment Based on a Large-Scale Clinical Trial: WiFi vs. Video vs. Doctor's Visual Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological gait disorders can affect a large population, with devastating consequences on the quality of life. In this paper, we are interested in fundamentally understanding the potential of emerging sensing modalities (e.g., WiFi) for neurological gait disorder assessment. Towards this goal, we conduct a one-year-long clinical trial in collaboration with the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara, the results of which are detailed in this paper. More specifically, our medical campaign encompasses 114 real subjects and a wide spectrum of disorders (e.g., Parkinson's, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia, and Arthritis). We then develop the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing system of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and diverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, we mainly leverage publicly-accessible online videos of gait disorders for training, and develop a video-to-RF pipeline to convert them to synthetic RF data. We then extensively test the system in a neurology center (i.e., the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara). In addition, we provide a 1-1 comparison with a vision-based system, by developing a vision-based gait disorder assessment system under the same exact conditions (e.g., same subjects, etc), a comparison crucial for developing smart health systems and the first of its kind to our knowledge. We finally contrast both systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing evaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait, by designing a large survey and distributing it to an extensive network of neurologists, thus offering the first such apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing modalities. Overall, the findings can shape the integration of new sensing modalities into medical practice, and pave the way toward equitable healthcare.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Sequential Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting a change in the distribution of a high-dimensional multivariate normal time series. Assuming that the post-change parameters are unknown and estimated using a window of historical data, we extend the framework of quickest change detection (QCD) to the highdimensional setting in which the number of variables increases proportionally with the size of the window used to estimate the post-change parameters. Our analysis reveals that an information theoretic quantity, which we call the Normalized High- Dimensional Kullback-Leibler divergence (NHDKL), governs the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of QCD procedures. Specifically, we show that the detection delay is asymptotically inversely proportional to the difference between the NHDKL of the true post-change versus pre-change distributions and the NHDKL of the true versus estimated post-change distributions. In cases of perfect estimation, where the latter NHDKL is zero, the delay is inversely proportional to the NHDKL between the post-change and pre-change distributions alone. Thus, our analysis is a direct generalization of the traditional fixed-dimension, large-sample asymptotic framework, where the standard KL divergence is asymptotically inversely proportional to detection delay. Finally, we identify parameter estimators that asymptotically minimize the NHDKL between the true versus estimated post-change distributions, resulting in a QCD method that is guaranteed to outperform standard approaches based on fixed-dimension asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Aero-engines Anomaly Detection using an Unsupervised Fisher Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable aero-engine anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring aircraft safety and operational efficiency. This research explores the application of the Fisher autoencoder as an unsupervised deep learning method for detecting anomalies in aero-engine multivariate sensor data, using a Gaussian mixture as the prior distribution of the latent space. The proposed method aims to minimize the Fisher divergence between the true and the modeled data distribution in order to train an autoencoder that can capture the normal patterns of aero-engine behavior. The Fisher divergence is robust to model uncertainty, meaning it can handle noisy or incomplete data. The Fisher autoencoder also has well-defined latent space regions, which makes it more generalizable and regularized for various types of aero-engines as well as facilitates diagnostic purposes. The proposed approach improves the accuracy of anomaly detection and reduces false alarms. Simulations using the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate the model's efficacy in achieving timely anomaly detection, even in the case of an unbalanced dataset.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Enabled Pinching Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which has the capabilities not only to combat large-scale path loss, but also to reconfigure the antenna array in a flexible manner. The key idea of pinching antennas is to apply small dielectric particles on a waveguide of arbitrary length, so that they can be positioned close to users to avoid significant large-scale path loss. This paper investigates the graph neural network (GNN) enabled transmit design for the joint optimization of antenna placement and power allocation in pinching-antenna systems. We formulate the downlink communication system equipped with pinching antennas as a bipartite graph, and propose a graph attention network (GAT) based model, termed bipartite GAT (BGAT), to solve an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. With the tailored readout processes, the BGAT guarantees a feasible solution, which also facilitates the unsupervised training. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of pinching antennas in enhancing the system EE as well as the proposed BGAT in terms of optimality, scalability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MU-MIMO mmWave Systems with Practical Hybrid Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a correlation-based three-stage channel estimation strategy with low pilot overhead for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user (MU) MIMO systems, in which both users and base station (BS) are equipped with a hybrid RF architecture. In Stage I, all users jointly transmit pilots and recover the uncompressed received signals to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Based on the observation that the overall cascaded MIMO channel can be decomposed into multiple sub-channels, the cascaded channel for a typical user is estimated in Stage II. Specifically, using the invariance of angles and the linear correlation of gains related to different cascaded subchannels, we use compressive sensing (CS), least squares (LS), and a one-dimensional search to estimate the Angles of Departure (AoDs), based on which the overall cascaded channel is obtained. In Stage III, the remaining users independently transmit pilots to estimate their individual cascaded channel with the same approach as in Stage II, which exploits the equivalent common RIS-BS channel obtained in Stage II to reduce the pilot overhead. In addition, the hybrid combining matrix and the RIS phase shift matrix are designed to reduce the noise power, thereby further improving the estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve high estimation accuracy especially when the number of antennas at the users is small, and reduce pilot overhead by more than five times compared with the existing benchmark approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling Allocation Strategies for General Graph-Filter-Based Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor placement plays a crucial role in graph signal recovery in underdetermined systems. In this paper, we present the graph-filtered regularized maximum likelihood (GFR-ML) estimator of graph signals, which integrates general graph filtering with regularization to enhance signal recovery performance under a limited number of sensors. Then, we investigate task-based sampling allocation aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the GFR-ML estimator by wisely choosing sensor placement. Since this MSE depends on the unknown graph signals to be estimated, we propose four cost functions for the optimization of the sampling allocation: the biased Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao bound (bCRB), the worst-case MSE (WC-MSE), the Bayesian MSE (BMSE), and the worst-case BMSE (WC-BMSE), where the last two assume a Gaussian prior. We investigate the properties of these cost functions and develop two algorithms for their practical implementation: 1) the straightforward greedy algorithm; and 2) the alternating projection gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results on synthetic and real-world datasets of the IEEE 118-bus power system and the Minnesota road network demonstrate that the proposed sampling allocation methods reduce the MSE by up to $50\%$ compared to the common sampling methods A-design, E-design, and LR-design in the tested scenarios. Thus, the proposed methods improve the estimation performance and reduce the required number of measurements in graph signal processing (GSP)-based signal recovery in the case of underdetermined systems.</description>

      <title>NOMANet: A Graph Neural Network Enabled Power Allocation Scheme for NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) enabled power allocation scheme for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. In particular, a downlink scenario with one base station serving multiple users over several subchannels is considered, where the number of subchannels is less than the number of users, and thus, some users have to share a subchannel via NOMA. Our goal is to maximize the system energy efficiency subject to the rate requirement of each user and the overall budget. We propose a deep learning based approach termed NOMA net (NOMANet) to address the considered problem. Particularly, NOMANet is GNN-based, which maps channel state information to the desired power allocation scheme for all subchannels. The multi-head attention and the residual/dense connection are adopted to enhance the feature extraction. The output of NOMANet is guaranteed to be feasible via the customized activation function and the penalty method. Numerical results show that NOMANet trained unsupervised achieves performance close to that of the successive convex approximation method but with a faster inference speed by about $700$ times. Besides, NOMANet is featured by its scalability to both users and subchannels.</description>

      <title>Positioning-Aided Channel Estimation for Multi-LEO Satellite Downlink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of channel estimation in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To overcome the constraints of limited link budgets and communication rates associated with single-satellite-based communication, we develop a distributed beamforming strategy for downlink communication. This strategy allows LEO satellites to independently optimize their beamformers using local channel state information, eliminating the need for centralized processing while preserving the advantages of multi-satellite cooperative communication. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.</description>

      <title>Beam Training for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the beam training design problems for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where single-waveguide-single-user (SWSU), single-waveguide-multi-user (SWMU) and multi-waveguide-multi-user (MWMU) scenarios are considered. For SWSU-PASS, we design a scalable codebook, based on which we propose a three-stage beam training (3SBT) scheme. Specifically, 1) firstly, the 3SBT scheme utilizes one activated pinching antenna to obtain a coarse one-dimensional location at the first stage; 2) secondly, it achieves further phase matching with an increased number of activated antennas at the second stage; 3) finally, it realizes precise beam alignment through an exhaustive search at the third stage. For SWMU-PASS, based on the scalable codebook design, we propose an improved 3SBT scheme to support non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. For MWMU-PASS, we first present a generalized expression of the received signal based on the partially-connected hybrid beamforming structure. Furthermore, we introduce an increased-dimensional scalable codebook design, based on which an increased-dimensional 3SBT scheme is proposed. Numerical results reveal that: i) the proposed beam training scheme can significantly reduce the training overhead compared to the two-dimensional exhaustive search, while maintaining reasonable rate performance; ii) compared to fixed-location pinching antennas and conventional array antennas, the proposed dynamic pinching antennas yield better flexibility and improved performance.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review of Deep Unfolding Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in wireless communications has been extensively explored, with deep unfolding emerging as a powerful model-based technique. Deep unfolding enhances interpretability by transforming complex iterative algorithms into structured layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach seamlessly integrates domain knowledge with deep learning (DL), leveraging the strengths of both methods to simplify complex signal processing tasks in communication systems. To provide a solid foundation, we first present a brief overview of DL and deep unfolding. We then explore the applications of deep unfolding in key areas, including signal detection, channel estimation, beamforming design, decoding for error-correcting codes, sensing and communication, power allocation, and security. Each section focuses on a specific task, highlighting its significance in emerging 6G technologies and reviewing recent advancements in deep unfolding-based solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing deep unfolding techniques and propose potential improvements to enhance their applicability across diverse wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Geolocation with Large LEO Constellations: Insights from Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in the use of the low earth orbit (LEO) in space - from $160 \text{ km}$ to $2000 \text{ km}$ - has skyrocketed; this is evident by the fact that National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has partnered with various commercial platforms like Axiom Space, Blue Origin, SpaceX, Sierra Space, Starlab Space, ThinkOrbital, and Vast Space to deploy satellites. %and platforms like Northrop Grumman and Boeing to transport cargo and crew. The most apparent advantage of satellites in LEO over satellites in Geostationary (GEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) is their closeness to the earth; hence, signals from LEOs encounter lower propagation losses and reduced propagation delay, opening up the possibility of using these LEO satellites for localization. This article reviews the existing signal processing algorithms for localization using LEO satellites, introduces the basics of estimation theory, connects estimation theory to model identifiability with Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), and with the FIM, provides conditions that allow for $9$D localization of a terrestrial receiver using signals from multiple LEOs (unsynchronized in time and frequency) across multiple time slots and multiple receive antennas. We also compare the structure of the information available in LEO satellites with the structure of the information available in the Global Positioning System (GPS).</description>

      <title>Weighted-Sum Energy Efficiency Maximization in User-Centric Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the weighted-sum energy efficiency (WSEE) as an advanced performance metric designed to represent the uplink energy efficiency (EE) of individual user equipment (UE) in a user-centric Cell-Free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system more accurately. In this realistic user-centric CF-mMIMO context, each UE may exhibit distinct characteristics, such as maximum transmit power limits or specific minimum data rate requirements. By computing the EE of each UE independently and adjusting the weights accordingly, the system can accommodate these unique attributes, thus promoting energy-efficient operation. The uplink WSEE is formulated as a multiple-ratio fractional programming (FP) problem, representing a weighted sum of the EE of individual UEs, which depends on each UE's transmit power and the combining vector at the CPU. To effectively maximize WSEE, we present optimization algorithms that utilize the Dinkelbach transform and the quadratic transform (QT). Applying the QT twice consecutively yields significant performance gains in terms of WSEE. This framework establishes a foundation for developing operational strategies tailored to specific system requirements.</description>

      <title>Pre-Equalization Aided Grant-Free Massive Access in Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial diversity and multiplexing advantages of massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) can significantly improve the capacity of massive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in machine type communications. However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs' activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled IoT Networks: A SWIPT Energy Harvesting Architecture with Relay Support for Disaster Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to establish Disaster Response Networks (DRNs), an effective model of energy harvesting (EH) and energy consumption for the UAV-aided Disaster Response Network (DRN) is rising to be a challenging issue. This is mainly manifest in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where multiple users are looking to communicate with the UAV. In this paper, the possibility of connecting an UAV with several users is investigated where the UAV as a relay receives data from a DRN and delivers to another network considering two IoT scenarios. The first scenario represents a conventional method with limited UAV energy where low communication rates and inadequate service coverage for all users are challenges. But in the second scenario, a Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transmission (SWIPT) technique is used to serve users. Considering potential limitations in transmission energy of users within disaster networks, the SWIPT technique is applied to maximize energy acquisition by the UAV, leading to improve the efficiency of the investigated scenario. Finally, the required energy of the UAV to serve the largest number of users in the shortest possible time is clarified. Furthermore, by Considering the relationship between energy and UAV flight time and defining the UAV flight time optimization problem, optimal network parameters are obtained. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scenario.</description>

      <title>A Novel Energy-aware Design for a D2D Underlaid UAV-Aided Cognitive Radio Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of a free disaster response network (free-DRN) and an energy harvesting enabled DRN (EH-enabled DRN) enhanced by cognitive radio (CR) technology and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the EH-enabled DRN scenario, where device-to-device (D2D) communication harvests energy from cellular users, significant improvements are demonstrated in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and communication rate compared to the free-DRN approach. The impact of user density and UAV specifications on network performance is analyzed, addressing the challenge of optimizing the duration of energy harvesting for both cellular users and D2D devices in the EH-enabled DRN scenario. Additionally, simulation results reveal an optimal UAV height that ensures efficient network operation for varying densities of D2D devices. Overall, numerical and simulation findings highlight the superior performance of the EH-enabled DRN approach, showcasing the positive effects of enabling D2D links and improved EE. Notably, reducing energy harvesting duration and cellular user density can further enhance the EE of the DRN by up to 3dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of power splitting(PS) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) architecture and federated learning (FL) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The use of SWIPT allows power-constrained devices to simultaneously harvest energy and transmit data, addressing the energy limitations faced by IoT devices. The proposed scenario involves an Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) serving as the base station (BS) and edge server, aggregating weight updates from IoT devices and unicasting aggregated updates to each device. The results demonstrate the feasibility of FL in IoT scenarios, ensuring communication efficiency without depleting device batteries.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Filter Spectra in CNN for Explainable Sleep Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by globally explaining spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, we introduce a method to retrieve the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compare it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We evaluate our approach on the MSA-CNN model using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. Our findings show that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-based spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Food Intake Quantity Using Inertial Signals from Smartwatches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate monitoring of eating behavior is crucial for managing obesity and eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. At the same time, existing methods rely on multiple and/or specialized sensors, greatly harming adherence and ultimately, the quality and continuity of data. This paper introduces a novel approach for estimating the weight of a bite, from a commercial smartwatch. Our publicly-available dataset contains smartwatch inertial data from ten participants, with manually annotated start and end times of each bite along with their corresponding weights from a smart scale, under semi-controlled conditions. The proposed method combines extracted behavioral features such as the time required to load the utensil with food, with statistical features of inertial signals, that serve as input to a Support Vector Regression model to estimate bite weights. Under a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.99 grams per bite. To contextualize this performance, we introduce the improvement metric, that measures the relative MAE difference compared to a baseline model. Our method demonstrates a 17.41% improvement, while the adapted state-of-the art method shows a -28.89% performance against that same baseline. The results presented in this work establish the feasibility of extracting meaningful bite weight estimates from commercial smartwatch inertial sensors alone, laying the groundwork for future accessible, non-invasive dietary monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Optical RIS-enabled Multiple Access Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) as key enablers of next-generation free-space optical (FSO) multiple access systems. By leveraging their beam steering and beam splitting capabilities, ORISs are able to effectively address line-of-sight (LoS) constraints, while enabling multi-user connectivity. We consider an ORIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system model consisting of a single transmitter (Tx) and two receivers (Rxs). We derive novel analytical expressions to characterize the statistical particularities of the Tx-ORIS-Rx communication channel. Building upon the aforementioned expressions, we investigate the outage performance of the Rxs by deriving exact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) of each Rx. To provide deeper insights into the impact of various system parameters and physical conditions on the outage performance of each Rx, we conduct a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis, that returns asymptotic expressions for the Rxs OPs at the high-SNR regime. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analysis, demonstrate the effectiveness of ORIS-enabled NOMA under a variety of configurations and physical scenarios, and showcase its superiority over its orthogonal-based counterpart.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Online Ensembles of Gaussian Processes for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible and scalable decentralized learning solutions are fundamentally important in the application of multi-agent systems. While several recent approaches introduce (ensembles of) kernel machines in the distributed setting, Bayesian solutions are much more limited. We introduce a fully decentralized, asymptotically exact solution to computing the random feature approximation of Gaussian processes. We further address the choice of hyperparameters by introducing an ensembling scheme for Bayesian multiple kernel learning based on online Bayesian model averaging. The resulting algorithm is tested against Bayesian and frequentist methods on simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Core Loss Based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a Mix Neural Network (MNN) based on CNN-FCNN for predicting magnetic loss of different materials. In traditional magnetic core loss models, empirical equations usually need to be regressed under the same external conditions. When the magnetic core material is different, it needs to be classified and discussed. If external factors increase, multiple models need to be proposed for classification and discussion, making the modeling process extremely cumbersome. And traditional empirical equations still has the problem of low accuracy, although various correction equations have been introduced later, the accuracy has always been unsatisfactory. By introducing machine learning and deep learning, it is possible to simultaneously solve prediction problems with low accuracy of empirical equations and complex conditions. Based on the MagNet database, through the training of the newly proposed MNN, it is found that a single model is sufficient to make predictions for at least four different materials under varying temperatures, frequencies, and waveforms, with accuracy far exceeding that of traditional models. At the same time, we also used three other machine learning and deep learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP-LSTM) for training, all of which had much higher accuracy than traditional models. On the basis of the predicted results, a hybrid model combining MNN and XGBoost was proposed, which predicted through weighting and found that the accuracy could continue to improve. This provides a solution for modeling magnetic core loss under different materials and operating modes.</description>

      <title>TrackDiffuser: Nearly Model-Free Bayesian Filtering with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation remains a fundamental challenge across numerous domains, from autonomous driving, aircraft tracking to quantum system control. Although Bayesian filtering has been the cornerstone solution, its classical model-based paradigm faces two major limitations: it struggles with inaccurate state space model (SSM) and requires extensive prior knowledge of noise characteristics. We present TrackDiffuser, a generative framework addressing both challenges by reformulating Bayesian filtering as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach implicitly learns system dynamics from data to mitigate the effects of inaccurate SSM, while simultaneously circumventing the need for explicit measurement models and noise priors by establishing a direct relationship between measurements and states. Through an implicit predict-and-update mechanism, TrackDiffuser preserves the interpretability advantage of traditional model-based filtering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms both classical and contemporary hybrid methods, especially in challenging non-linear scenarios involving non-Gaussian noises. Notably, TrackDiffuser exhibits remarkable robustness to SSM inaccuracies, offering a practical solution for real-world state estimation problems where perfect models and prior knowledge are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Nonnegative Matrix Factorization For Cardiorespiratory Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study represents the first integration of large language models (LLMs) with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), marking a novel advancement in the source separation field. The LLM is employed in two unique ways: enhancing the separation results by providing detailed insights for disease prediction and operating in a feedback loop to optimize a fundamental frequency penalty added to the NMF cost function. We tested the algorithm on two datasets: 100 synthesized mixtures of real measurements, and 210 recordings of heart and lung sounds from a clinical manikin including both individual and mixed sounds, captured using a digital stethoscope. The approach consistently outperformed existing methods, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance medical sound analysis for disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Enabled Near-Field Multiuser Beamfocusing in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces represent a breakthrough technology capable of customizing the wireless channel cost-effectively. However, the existing works generally focus on planar wavefront, neglecting near-field spherical wavefront characteristics caused by large array aperture and high operation frequencies in the terahertz (THz). Additionally, the single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) lacks the signal processing ability to mitigate the computational complexity at the base station (BS). To address this issue, we introduce a novel stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) comprised of an array of programmable metasurface layers. The SIM aims to substitute conventional digital baseband architecture to execute computing tasks with ultra-low processing delay, albeit with a reduced number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and low-resolution digital-to-analog converters. In this paper, we present a SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) near-field system, where the SIM is integrated into the BS to perform beamfocusing in the wave domain and customize an end-to-end channel with minimized inter-user interference. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that near-field communication achieves superior spatial gain over the far-field, and the SIM effectively suppresses inter-user interference as the wireless signals propagate through it.</description>

      <title>Col-OLHTR: A Novel Framework for Multimodal Online Handwritten Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Handwritten Text Recognition (OLHTR) has gained considerable attention for its diverse range of applications. Current approaches usually treat OLHTR as a sequence recognition task, employing either a single trajectory or image encoder, or multi-stream encoders, combined with a CTC or attention-based recognition decoder. However, these approaches face several drawbacks: 1) single encoders typically focus on either local trajectories or visual regions, lacking the ability to dynamically capture relevant global features in challenging cases; 2) multi-stream encoders, while more comprehensive, suffer from complex structures and increased inference costs. To tackle this, we propose a Collaborative learning-based OLHTR framework, called Col-OLHTR, that learns multimodal features during training while maintaining a single-stream inference process. Col-OLHTR consists of a trajectory encoder, a Point-to-Spatial Alignment (P2SA) module, and an attention-based decoder. The P2SA module is designed to learn image-level spatial features through trajectory-encoded features and 2D rotary position embeddings. During training, an additional image-stream encoder-decoder is collaboratively trained to provide supervision for P2SA features. At inference, the extra streams are discarded, and only the P2SA module is used and merged before the decoder, simplifying the process while preserving high performance. Extensive experimental results on several OLHTR benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, proving the effectiveness and robustness of our design.</description>

      <title>Token-Domain Multiple Access: Exploiting Semantic Orthogonality for Collision Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Token communications is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and transformer-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as ToDMA, where a large number of devices share a tokenizer and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, the source signal is tokenized into sequences, with each token modulated into a codeword. Codewords from multiple devices are transmitted simultaneously, resulting in overlap at the receiver. The receiver detects the transmitted tokens, assigns them to their respective sources, and mitigates token collisions by leveraging context and semantic orthogonality across the devices' messages. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed ToDMA framework outperforms context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods in image transmission tasks, achieving lower latency and better image quality.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reconfigurable Optical Wireless Ether</title>

Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) uses light for wireless data transmission, potentially providing faster and more secure communication than traditional radio-frequency-based techniques like Wi-Fi. However, light's high directionality and its limited penetration ability restrict the signal coverage. To address this limitation, we propose an artificial "optical wireless ether" (OWE) fabric. OWE acts as a reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) wave-propagating medium, intelligently enhancing the strength of light signals and redirecting their propagation to cover a broader area. Our proposed ether fabric comprises simple optical signal amplification units, called ether amplifiers (EAs), strategically placed in the environment, e.g., on ceilings. The EAs amplify and propagate signals at the analog level and are agnostic to the signal format: Signals propagate wirelessly between the EAs, losing strength due to attenuation during transmission but regaining it as they pass through the EAs. The key challenge in OWE design lies in the fact that, while increasing EA gains can extend signal coverage, it can also create positive feedback loops, resulting in self-interference and amplifier saturation, which distort the signals -- the key challenge in OWE design. This paper presents a systematic theoretical analysis to prevent amplifier saturation while optimizing the performance of OWE in both single-basic-service-set (single-BSS) and multiple-BSS scenarios. Optimization objectives could include signal-to-noise ratio, resource allocation fairness, and mutual interference. Furthermore, we conducted simulations and experiments to corroborate our theories. To our knowledge, ours is the first experimental demonstration of the feasibility of an artificial ether fabric for extending and guiding light propagation, laying a solid groundwork for future development and exploration of OWE.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</description>

      <title>Joint 9D Receiver Localization and Ephemeris Correction with LEO and $5$G Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to analyze the interaction between low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and $5$G base stations in providing $9$D receiver localization and correcting LEO ephemeris. First, we give a channel model that captures all the information in the LEO-receiver, LEO-BS, and BS-receiver links. Subsequently, we use FIM to capture the amount of information about the channel parameters in these links. Then, we transform these FIM for channel parameters to the FIM for the $9$D ($3$D position, $3$D orientation, and $3$D velocity estimation) receiver localization parameters and the LEO position and velocity offset. Closed-form expressions for the entries in the FIM for these location parameters are presented. Our results on identifiability utilizing the FIM for the location parameters indicate: i) with one LEO, we need three BSs and three time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity, ii) with two LEO, we need three BSs and three time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity, and iii) with three LEO, we need three BSs and four-time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity. Another key insight is that through the Cramer Rao lower bound we show that with a single LEO, three time slots, and three BSs, the receiver positioning error, velocity estimation error, orientation error, LEO position offset estimation error, and LEO velocity offset estimation error are $0.1 \text{ cm}$, $1 \text{ mm/s}$, $10^{-3} \text{ rad}$, $0.01 \text{ m}$, and $1 \text{ m/s}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Wavelet GPT: Wavelet Inspired Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure. This paper infuses LLMs with a traditional signal processing idea, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture in an academic setup, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, audio, and images. This is done by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Further, we show this extends to the Long Range Arena benchmark and several input representations such as characters, BPE tokens, bytes, waveform, math expression, and image pixels. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every decoder block. We hope this will pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing into pre-training.</description>

Abstract: With the advancements in graph neural network, there has been increasing interest in applying this network to ECG signal analysis. In this study, we generated an adjacency matrix using correlation matrix of extracted features and applied a graph neural network to classify arrhythmias.

      <title>Canine EEG Helps Human: Cross-Species and Cross-Modality Epileptic Seizure Detection via Multi-Space Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy significantly impacts global health, affecting about 65 million people worldwide, along with various animal species. The diagnostic processes of epilepsy are often hindered by the transient and unpredictable nature of seizures. Here we propose a multi-space alignment approach based on cross-species and cross-modality electroencephalogram (EEG) data to enhance the detection capabilities and understanding of epileptic seizures. By employing deep learning techniques, including domain adaptation and knowledge distillation, our framework aligns cross-species and cross-modality EEG signals to enhance the detection capability beyond traditional within-species and with-modality models. Experiments on multiple surface and intracranial EEG datasets of humans and canines demonstrated substantial improvements in the detection accuracy, achieving over 90% AUC scores for cross-species and cross-modality seizure detection with extremely limited labeled data from the target species/modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous data from different species and modalities to improve EEG-based seizure detection performance. The approach may also be generalizable to different brain-computer interface paradigms, and suggests the possibility to combine data from different species/modalities to increase the amount of training data for large EEG models.</description>

      <title>Perception-Guided EEG Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach Inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.</description>

      <title>Learned Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound for Unknown Measurement Models Using Score Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) is a crucial tool in signal processing for assessing the fundamental limitations of any estimation problem as well as benchmarking within a Bayesian frameworks. However, the BCRB cannot be computed without full knowledge of the prior and the measurement distributions. In this work, we propose a fully learned Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (LBCRB) that learns both the prior and the measurement distributions. Specifically, we suggest two approaches to obtain the LBCRB: the Posterior Approach and the Measurement-Prior Approach. The Posterior Approach provides a simple method to obtain the LBCRB, whereas the Measurement-Prior Approach enables us to incorporate domain knowledge to improve the sample complexity and {interpretability}. To achieve this, we introduce a Physics-encoded score neural network which enables us to easily incorporate such domain knowledge into a neural network. We {study the learning} errors of the two suggested approaches theoretically, and validate them numerically. We demonstrate the two approaches on several signal processing examples, including a linear measurement problem with unknown mixing and Gaussian noise covariance matrices, frequency estimation, and quantized measurement. In addition, we test our approach on a nonlinear signal processing problem of frequency estimation with real-world underwater ambient noise.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Subspace Variational Bayesian Inference for Joint Scattering Environment Sensing and Data Recovery in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a joint scattering environment sensing and data recovery problem in an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To facilitate joint scatterers localization and multi-user (MU) channel estimation, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) location-domain sparse channel model to capture the joint sparsity of the MU channel (i.e., different user channels share partially overlapped scatterers). Then the joint problem is formulated as a bilinear structured sparse recovery problem with a dynamic position grid and imperfect parameters (such as time offset and user position errors). We propose an expectation maximization based turbo bilinear subspace variational Bayesian inference (EM-Turbo-BiSVBI) algorithm to solve the problem effectively, where the E-step performs Bayesian estimation of the the location-domain sparse MU channel by exploiting the joint sparsity, and the M-step refines the dynamic position grid and learns the imperfect factors via gradient update. Two methods are introduced to greatly reduce the complexity with almost no sacrifice on the performance and convergence speed: 1) a subspace constrained bilinear variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method is proposed to avoid any high-dimensional matrix inverse; 2) the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and subspace constrained VBI methods are combined to obtain a coarse estimation result to reduce the search range. Simulations verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position Optimization for Movable Antenna-Empowered Near-Field Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) show great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of MAs for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information of a target. First, to gain essential insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only the spatial angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. We derive the worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation via the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within a linear array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-aided far-field sensing. Furthermore, we proceed to the more challenging case with the joint AoA and distance estimation and derive the worst-case CRB under the two-dimensional (2D) MUSIC algorithm. The corresponding CRB minimization problem is efficiently solved by adopting a discrete sampling-based approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing significantly outperforms conventional sensing with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle or distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A noise-corrupted image often requires interpolation. Given a linear denoiser and a linear interpolator, when should the operations be independently executed in separate steps, and when should they be combined and jointly optimized? We study joint denoising / interpolation of images from a mixed graph filtering perspective: we model denoising using an undirected graph, and interpolation using a directed graph. We first prove that, under mild conditions, a linear denoiser is a solution graph filter to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem regularized using an undirected graph smoothness prior, while a linear interpolator is a solution to a MAP problem regularized using a directed graph smoothness prior. Next, we study two variants of the joint interpolation / denoising problem: a graph-based denoiser followed by an interpolator has an optimal separable solution, while an interpolator followed by a denoiser has an optimal non-separable solution. Experiments show that our joint denoising / interpolation method outperformed separate approaches noticeably.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid STAR-RIS Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for local communication users and sensing targets situated within the same physical region as the base station (BS), while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for distant communication users and sensing targets situated far from of the coverage area of the BS. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate communication and sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Wavelength Arbitration for Microring-based DWDM Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of autonomous microring arbitration, or wavelength arbitration, to address the challenge of multi-microring initialization in microring-based Dense-Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed (DWDM) transceivers. This arbitration is inherently policy-driven, defining critical system characteristics such as the spectral ordering of microrings. Furthermore, to facilitate large-scale deployment, the arbitration algorithms must operate independently of specific wavelength information and be resilient to system variability. Addressing these complexities requires a holistic approach that encompasses the entire system, from device-level variabilities to the transceiver electrical-to-optical interface - this system-wide perspective is the focus of this paper. To support efficient analysis, we develop a hierarchical framework incorporating an ideal, wavelength-aware arbitration model to examine arbitration failures at both the policy and algorithmic levels. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in two ways: by analyzing the robustness of each policy in relation to device variabilities, and by developing an algorithm that achieves near-perfect alignment with the ideal model, offering superior robustness compared to the traditional sequential tuning method. The simulator code used in this paper is available at https://github.com/wdmsim/wdm-simulator.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Models with 1-Bit Measurements: Asymptotics of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the multiple parameter maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) from censored data, where the censoring mechanism is in the form of $1$-bit measurements. The underlying distribution of the uncensored data is assumed to belong to the exponential family, with natural parameters expressed as a linear combination of the predictors, known as generalized linear model (GLM). As part of the analysis, the Fisher information matrix is also derived for both censored and uncensored data, which helps to quantify the impact of censoring and assess the performance of the MLE. The choice of GLM allows one to consider a variety of practical examples where 1-bit estimation is of interest. In particular, it is shown how the derived results can be used to analyze two practically relevant scenarios: the Gaussian model with both unknown mean and variance, and the Poisson model with an unknown mean.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Wireless Powered Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple fixed position antennas (FPAs) provides integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) services towards low-power devices that are equipped with a single fluid antenna (FA), while the low-power devices use harvested energy to power their own uplink transmission. Using the block correlation channel model, both the downlink and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT) outage probabilities are analyzed under specific port selection strategies, including downlink signal-to-interference ratio-based port selection (DSPS) strategy, downlink energy harvesting power-based port selection (DEPS) strategy, uplink signal-to-noise ratio-based port selection (USPS) strategy, and uplink channel-based port selection (UCPS) strategy. A step function approximation (SFA) approach is also relied upon to derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities, while the lower bounds for uplink WDT outage probabilities are also formulated. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis, which also provide useful guidelines for the system design through the analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN): A Unified Time-Frequency Approach for ECG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has transformed the classification of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable automatic feature extraction, raising the question: Can combining time- and frequency-domain attributes enhance classification accuracy? To explore this, we evaluated three ECG classification tasks: (1) arrhythmia classification, (2) identity recognition, and (3) apnea detection. We initially tested three methods: (i) 2-D spectrogram-based frequency-time classification (SPECT), (ii) time-domain classification using a 1-D CNN (CNN1D), and (iii) frequency-domain classification using a Fourier transform-based CNN (FFT1D). Performance was validated using K-fold cross-validation. Among these, CNN1D (time only) performed best, followed by SPECT (time-frequency) and FFT1D (frequency only). Surprisingly, SPECT, which integrates time- and frequency-domain features, performed worse than CNN1D, suggesting a need for a more effective time and frequency fusion approach. To address this, we tested the recently proposed Fourier Analysis Network (FAN), which combines time- and frequency-domain features. However, FAN performed comparably to CNN1D, excelling in some tasks while underperforming in others. To enhance this approach, we developed the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), which integrates FAN with CNN. CFAN outperformed all previous methods across all classification tasks. These findings underscore the advantages of combining time- and frequency-domain features, demonstrating CFAN's potential as a powerful and versatile solution for ECG classification and broader biomedical signal analysis</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

      <title>Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</description>
