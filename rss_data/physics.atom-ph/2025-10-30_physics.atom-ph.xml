      <title>Encoding computationally hard problems in triangular Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays are a promising platform for quantum optimization, encoding computationally hard problems by reducing them to independent set problems with unit-disk graph topology. In Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023), a systematic and efficient strategy was introduced to encode multiple problems into a special unit-disk graph: the King's subgraph. However, King's subgraphs are not the optimal choice in two dimensions. Due to the power-law decay of Rydberg interaction strengths, the approximation to unit-disk graphs in real devices is poor, necessitating post-processing that lacks physical interpretability. In this work, we develop an encoding scheme that can universally encode computationally hard problems on triangular lattices, based on our innovative automated gadget search strategy. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum optimization on triangular lattices reduces independence-constraint violations by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to King's subgraphs, substantially alleviating the need for post-processing in experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering Atom-Photon Hybridization with Density-Modulated Atomic Ensembles in Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-matter hybridization allows atoms to serve as mediators of effective interactions between light modes and, conversely, to interact among themselves via light. Here we exploit the spatial structure of atomic ensembles to control the coupling between modes of distinct cavities, thereby reshaping the resulting atom-photon spectra. We show that extended homogeneous clouds suppress mode-mode couplings through destructive interference, whereas grated clouds can preserve them under specific Bragg conditions. This leads to mode-mode spectral subsplittings, where collectivity arises not only from the atom number but also from the ability to tune modes of different cavities independently. Our results establish spatially engineered atomic ensembles as a pathway to selective photon transfer between modes and precise control of many-body complexity.</description>

      <title>An efficient high-current circuit for fast radio-frequency spectroscopy in cold atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design and implement a low-impedance, high-current radio-frequency (RF) circuit, enabling fast coherent coupling between magnetic levels in cold alkali atomic samples. It is based on a compact shape-optimized coil that maximizes the RF field coupling with the atomic magnetic dipole, and on coaxial transmission-line transformers that step up the field-generating current flowing in the coil by a factor $\sim\,4$ to about $7.5\,$A for $100\,$W of RF driving. This allows to obtain a RF coupling field of about $0.035\,\text{G}/\sqrt{\text{W}}$ at the atomic sample location. The system is robust and versatile, as it generates a large RF field without compromising on the available optical access, and its central resonant frequency can be adjusted in situ. Our approach provides a cost-effective, reliable solution, featuring a negligible level of interference with surrounding electronic equipment thanks to its symmetric layout. We test the circuit performance using a maximum RF power of $80\,$W at a frequency around $82\,$MHz, which corresponds to a measured Rabi frequency $\Omega_R/2\pi \simeq 18.5\,$kHz, i.e. a $\pi$-pulse duration of about $27\,\mu$s, between two of the lowest states of ${}^6$Li at an offset magnetic field of $770\,$G. Our solution can be readily adapted to other atomic species and vacuum chamber designs, in view of an increasing modularity of cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-body Physics in the Impurity Limit of 39K Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, three-body loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for the extraction of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive mid-circuit measurement and reset on atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement and reset of subsets of qubits is a crucial ingredient of quantum error correction and many quantum information applications. Measurement of atomic qubits is accomplished through resonant fluorescence, which typically disturbs neighboring atoms due to photon scattering. We propose and prototype a new scheme for measurement that provides both spatial and spectral isolation by using tightly-focused individual laser beams and narrow atomic transitions. The unique advantage of this scheme is that all operations are applied exclusively to the read-out qubit, with negligible disturbance to the other qubits of the same species and little overhead. In this letter, we pave the way for non-invasive and high fidelity mid-circuit measurement and demonstrate all key building blocks on a single trapped barium ion.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of below-threshold harmonics in aligned molecules: a few-level model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics generated from aligned molecules. In a two-level system, we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition energy between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders. In contrast, the phase remains constant for harmonics above the transition energy. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled two-level systems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the below-threshold regime.</description>
