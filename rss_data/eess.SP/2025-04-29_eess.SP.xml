      <title>DMA Reception for Simultaneous Area-Wide Sensing and Multi-User Uplink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge in deploying extremely large antenna arrays is expected to play a vital role in future sixth generation wireless networks, enabling advanced radar target localization with enhanced angular and range resolution. This paper focuses on the promising technology of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs), integrating numerous sub-wavelength-spaced metamaterials within a single aperture, and presents a novel framework for designing its analog reception beamforming weights with the goal to optimize sensing performance within a spatial Area of Interest (AoI), while simultaneously guaranteeing desired multi-user uplink communication performance. We derive the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) with DMA-based reception for both passive and active radar targets lying inside the AoI, which is then used as the optimization objective for configuring the discrete tunable phases of the metamaterials. Capitalizing on the DMA partially-connected architecture, we formulate the design problem as convex optimization and present both direct CRB minimization approaches and low complexity alternatives using a lower-bound approximation. Simulation results across various scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Tracking-Aided Multi-User MIMO Communications with Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs) constitute a new paradigm that redefines smart metasurfaces, not only offering tunable reflections of incoming signals, but also incorporating signal reception and processing capabilities. In this paper, leveraging the simultaneous dual-functionality of HRISs, we propose a novel framework for tracking-aided multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications. In particular, a joint design of the transmit multi-user precoding matrix together with the HRIS reflection and analog combining configurations is presented, with the objective to maximize the accuracy of position estimation of multiple mobile users while meeting their individual quality-of-service constraints for sensing-aided communications. The Cramer-Rao bound for the users' positioning parameters is derived together with a prediction approach based on the extended Kalman filter. Our simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed Integrated Sensing And Communications (ISAC) framework over various system configuration parameters.</description>

      <title>BEM-Assisted Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems over Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) based on generalized complex exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) over doubly selective channels. The GCE-BEM is used to solve fractional Doppler dispersion while significantly reducing the computational complexity of exhaustive search. Then, the closed-form expression of channel estimation error is derived for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated channel, the MMSE detection is adopt to characterize the impacts of estimated channel on bit error rate (BER) by deriving the theoretical lower bound. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates severe inter-Doppler interference (IDoI). Our theoretical performance an alysis can perfectly match the Monte-Carlo results, validating the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation based on GCE-BEM.</description>

      <title>Two-Agent DRL for Power Allocation and IRS Orientation in Dynamic NOMA-based OWC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on MIMO-OFDM ISAC: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where communication and sensing (C&amp;S) services are simultaneously provided through shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in 6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths, higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the dominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very competitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate the potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing algorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by their extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW) characteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM ISAC.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization of Transistor Voltage Amplifiers Based on Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon, i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs. To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and 94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.</description>

      <title>ODE-Former for Mobile Channel Prediction: A Novel Learning Structure Leveraging The Physics Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial and challenging for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. With the increasing antenna scale and user mobility, traditional channel estimation approaches suffer greatly from high signaling overhead and channel aging problems. By exploring the intrinsic correlation among a set of historical CSI instances, channel prediction is proven to increase the CSI accuracy while lowering the signaling overhead significantly. Existing works view this problem as a regular discrete sequence prediction task while ignoring the unique physics property of wireless channels. This letter proposes a novel former-like learning structure based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) inclusively designed for accurate and flexible channel prediction. The proposed network aims to represent wireless channels' implicit physics spatial-temporal continuity by integrating the Neural ODE into a former-like learning structure. Our proposed method impeccably fits channel matrices' mathematics features and enjoys solid network interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed learning approach outperforms existing methods from the perspective of accuracy, flexibility, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Coherent Source Enumeration with Compact ULAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source enumeration typically relies on subspace-based techniques that require accurate separation of signal and noise subspaces. However, prior works do not address coherent sources in small uniform linear arrays, where ambiguities arise in the spatial spectrum. We address this by decomposing the forward-backward smoothed covariance matrix into a sum of a rank-constrained Toeplitz matrix and a diagonal matrix with non-negative entries representing the signal and noise subspace, respectively. We solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem by proposing Toeplitz approach for rank-based target estimation (TARgEt) that employs the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TARgEt over a recent subspace matching method and a related covariance matrix reconstruction approach.</description>

      <title>UAV-Aided Progressive Interference Source Localization Based on Improved Trust Region Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust region optimization-based received signal strength indicator (RSSI) interference source localization methods have been widely used in low-altitude research. However, these methods often converge to local optima in complex environments, degrading the positioning performance. This paper presents a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided progressive interference source localization method based on improved trust region optimization. By combining the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO), our proposed method can effectively enhance the success rate of localization. We also propose a confidence quantification approach based on the UAV-to-ground channel model. This approach considers the surrounding environmental information of the sampling points and dynamically adjusts the weight of the sampling data during the data fusion. As a result, the overall positioning accuracy can be significantly improved. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method can achieve high-precision interference source localization in noisy and interference-prone environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison Research of Millimeter-Wave/Infrared Co-aperture Reflector Antenna Systems Based on a Specialized Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel co-aperture reflector antenna operating in millimeter-wave (MMW) and infrared (IR) for cloud detection radar. The proposed design combines a back-fed dual-reflector antenna, an IR optical reflection system, and a specialize thin film with IR-reflective/MMW-transmissive properties. Simulations demonstrate a gain exceeding 50 dBi within 94 GHz plush or minus 500 MHz bandwidth, with 0.46{\deg} beamwidth in both azimuth (E-plane) and elevation (H-plane) and sidelobe levels below -25 dB. This co-aperture architecture addresses the limitations of standalone MMW and IR radars, enabling high-resolution cloud microphysical parameter retrieval while minimizing system footprint. The design lays a foundation for airborne/spaceborne multi-mode detection systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning based Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control System with ResNet Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective fixed-filter strategy is popular in industrial applications involving active noise control (ANC) technology, which circumvents the time-consuming online learning process by selecting the best-matched pre-trained control filter. However, the existing selective fixed-filter ANC (SFANC) based algorithms classify noises in frequency band, which is not a reasonable approach. Moreover, they pre-train the control filter utilizing only a single noise segment, leading to inaccurate estimation and undesirable noise cancellation performance when dealing with dynamically time-varying noise. Inspired by the applicability of meta-learning to various models utilizing gradient descent technique, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning based SFANC system, wherein the fixed-filters that may not be optimal for specific types of noises but can rapidly adapt to previously unseen noise conditions are pre-trained. To address the mismatch issue between meta-learning update methods and ANC requirements while enhancing the receptive field and convergence speed of control filters, a multiple-input batch processing strategy is utilized in pre-training. Simulations based on the common ESC-50 noise dataset are performed and demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy, convergence speed, and steady-state noise cancellation.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Collinear Dipole Array Design with Dual-Polarization Operation for Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large intelligent surface (LIS) is a promising approach to enhancing 6G performance in sub-10 GHz frequency bands. An analysis of the horizontal dipole linear array reveals that when the array size is sufficiently large, employing the conjugate phase method to excite the antenna elements results in a focal point along the central line of the array that gradually stabilizes at a constant value. The study evaluates the 3dB focal resolution generated by the dipole array for two polarizations. Additionally, the feasibility of generating circularly polarized focal points and the focal displacement under a limited array size are explored. Previous near-field focal synthesis methods primarily considered only the line-of-sight (LOS) channel. To enhance practicality, this study adopts a two-ray channel model to analyze near-field focal synthesis results in the presence of a reflected path. Both two polarizations are discussed separately, with design guidelines provided for array placement and focal point positioning. Finally, electromagnetic simulations are conducted within the linear array to validate the proposed design. These simulations highlight the capability of the horizontal dipole array configuration to be directly applied without significant coupling effects between elements. The proposed design guidelines lay a solid foundation for the application of LIS in 6G technology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Azimuth Sampling and Interpolation for Bistatic ISAC Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) networks is to define the angular operations of transmitter and receiver, i.e., the sampling task of the angular domains, to acquire information about the environment. In this work we extend previous analysis for optimal angular sampling of monostatic setups to two-dimensional bistatic deployments, that are as important as the former in future ISAC cellular scenarios. Our approach overcomes the limitations of suboptimal prior art sampling and interpolation techniques, such as spline interpolation. We demonstrate that separating azimuth operations of the two transmit and receive arrays is optimal to sample the angular domain in an array-specific normalized angular frequency (NAF). This allows us to derive a loss-less reconstruction of the angular domain, enabling a more efficient and accurate sampling strategy for bistatic sensing applications compared to legacy approaches. As demonstrated by different Monte Carlo experiments, our approach enables future bistatic ISAC deployments with better performance compared to the other suboptimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Target Detection for ISAC with TDD Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) poses various challenges that arise from the communication-centric design of cellular networks. One of them is target detection with time division duplex (TDD) transmission used in current 5G and future 6G deployments, where the periodic on-off behavior of the transmitter creates impulsive sidelobes in the radar point spread function (PSF). These can be mistaken for actual targets by conventional peak detection techniques, leading to false alarms. In this work, we first analytically describe the range-Doppler PSF due to TDD windowing. We then propose a computationally efficient method that leverages the PSF to distinguish impulsive sidelobes from valid target peaks. Simulation results and outdoor drone measurements with an ISAC proof of concept demonstrate the capability of our algorithm, showing that it can achieve reliable target detection while limiting false alarms.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Wideband Beam Training for Near-field Communications with Ultra-low Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a super-resolution wideband beam training method for near-field communications, which is able to achieve ultra-low overhead. To this end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform linear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to a new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates multiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple versions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one directional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow blocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then, by exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains, we propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely large-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate a set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the time-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the received signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the angular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the central subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to estimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at the estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams over subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam training scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training, while achieving near-optimal rate performance.</description>

      <title>Novel Selection Schemes for Multi-RIS-Assisted Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted fluid antenna system (FAS). In this system, a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a planar FAS through multiple RISs in the absence of a direct link. To enhance the system performance, we propose two novel selection schemes: \textit{Max-Max} and \textit{Max-Sum}. In particular, the \textit{Max-Max} scheme selects the best combination of a single RIS and a single fluid antenna (FA) port that offers the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. On the other hand, the \textit{Max-Sum} scheme selects one RIS while activating all FA ports providing the highest overall SNR. We conduct a detailed performance analysis of the proposed system under Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. First, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the SNR for both selection schemes. The derived CDF is then used to obtain approximate theoretical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR). Next, a high-SNR asymptotic analysis is carried out to provide further insights into the system performance in terms of diversity and coding gains. Finally, the analytical results are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating their accuracy and providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance.</description>

      <title>A Model-based DNN for Learning HMIMO Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) is a promising technique for large-scale MIMO systems to enhance spectral efficiency while maintaining low hardware cost and power consumption. Existing alternating optimization algorithms can effectively optimize the hybrid beamforming of HMIMO to improve the system performance, while their high computational complexity hinders real-time application. In this paper, we propose a model-based deep neural network (MB-DNN), which leverages permutation equivalent properties and the optimal beamforming structure to jointly optimize the holographic and digital beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MB-DNN outperforms benchmark schemes and requires much less inference time than existing alternating optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deployment Optimization for XL-IRS Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the deployment optimization for an extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) assisted multi-user communication system, within which the channels between the XL-IRS and the BS (or user) are modeled by the near-field spherical wavefronts. To draw some valuable insights, we first consider the single-user case, where an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is devised to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user. To address the high computational complexity issue incurred by the AO based algorithm, three approximate received SNR expressions are obtained to yield useful insights, corresponding to the upper bound, approximate expression, and closed-form. It is demonstrated that the XL-IRS ought to be positioned near the user (rather than the BS) to obtain a higher beamforming gain. Then, for the multi-user scenario, an efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality XL-IRS placement solution by using the AO and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore, the effective degree of freedom (DoF) of the BS-IRS channel is provided, which indicates that the additional effective DoF can be leveraged to improve multi-user spatial multiplexing. Last, numerical results confirm the existence of a trade-off between near-field beam-focusing gain and multiplexing gain.</description>

      <title>Physical-Layer Security in Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology to improve the spectrum efficiency and spatial resolution of future wireless systems. Different from existing works that mostly considered physical layer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this paper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located in the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located in the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance, referred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs by optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the total BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a one-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the Bob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission region is significantly \emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional far-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field scenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It is revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the other Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for intercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the benchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the (simplified) far-field channel model.</description>

      <title>Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Genetic Beam Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token communication (TC) is poised to play a pivotal role in emerging language-driven applications such as AI-generated content (AIGC) and wireless language models (LLMs). However, token loss caused by channel noise can severely degrade task performance. To address this, in this article, we focus on the problem of semantics-aware packetization and develop a novel algorithm, termed semantic packet aggregation with genetic beam search (SemPA-GBeam), which aims to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) over erasure channels. Inspired from the genetic algorithm (GA) and the beam search algorithm, SemPA-GBeam iteratively optimizes token grouping for packetization within a fixed number of groups (i.e., fixed beam width in beam search) while randomly swapping a fraction of tokens (i.e., mutation in GA). Experiments on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that SemPA-GBeam achieves ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search while reducing complexity by more than 20x.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Optimisation of a Multi-User STAR-RIS-Aided System with Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. However, the conventional RIS can only reflect the incident signal. Hence, it provides a limited coverage, as compared to a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS). Prior works on the STAR-RIS address the power minimisation or the sum-rate maximisation problem by reformulating the objective problem as a convex optimisation problem and then employing numerical tools like CVX to obtain the solution, which introduces significant computational complexity leading to a huge runtime, making the algorithms impractical for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose a low complexity solution for the optimisation of a multi-user STAR-RIS system, where the non-convex optimisation problem is decomposed into multiple convex sub-problems with closed-form optimal solutions. The simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves similar performance to CVX-based solutions in the literature while being computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prior work, conducted since 2017, two celestial pointing directions have been observed to be associated with the measurement of anomalous high counts of narrow bandwidth, short duration, polarized radio frequency pulse pairs. The prior experimental work utilized up to three geographically-spaced synchronized radio telescopes, a single-dish radio telescope, and a radio interferometer. The experimental work reported here examines full right ascension coverage at one declination, utilizing the interferometer, during 124.1 days. Results suggest the possible presence of an additional anomalous celestial pointing direction. Seven standard deviations of noise-modeled shifts of mean polarized pulse pair count were observed in three celestial directions. Indications of interferometer space delay aliasing were observed. A phase noise test, celestial source identification methods and associated measurements were used to seek potential explanations of the unusual observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation Protocol for Non-Diagonal RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer enhanced wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an $M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails estimating the CSI for all $M \times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in a total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that maximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training intervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that substantially reduces the need for exhaustive $M!$ permutations by utilizing only three configurations to optimize the non-diagonal RIS switch array and beamforming for single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, our three-stage pilot-based protocol estimates scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol from conventional RIS. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the BS computational load from $\mathcal{O}(NM\times M!)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity is similar to the conventional ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Heterogeneous Multi-Task Optimization in Semantic Broadcast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic broadcast communications (Semantic BC) for image transmission have achieved significant performance gains for single-task scenarios. Nevertheless, extending these methods to multi-task scenarios remains challenging, as different tasks typically require distinct objective functions, leading to potential conflicts within the shared encoder. In this paper, we propose a tri-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-task Semantic BC framework, termed SemanticBC-TriRL, which effectively resolves such conflicts and enables the simultaneous support of multiple downstream tasks at the receiver side, including image classification and content reconstruction tasks. Specifically, the proposed framework employs a bottom-up tri-level alternating learning strategy, formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. At the first level, task-specific decoders are locally optimized using supervised learning. At the second level, the shared encoder is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO), guided by task-oriented rewards. At the third level, a multi-gradient aggregation-based task weighting module adaptively adjusts task priorities and steers the encoder optimization. Through this hierarchical learning process, the encoder and decoders are alternately trained, and the three levels are cohesively integrated via constrained learning objective. Besides, the convergence of SemanticBC-TriRL is also theoretically established. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework across diverse channel conditions, particularly in low SNR regimes, and confirm its scalability with increasing numbers of receivers.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Cross Far- and Near-Field Beam Management Technologies in Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication toward next-generation networks introduces unprecedented demands on data rates, latency, and connectivity. To meet these requirements, two key trends have emerged: the use of higher communication frequencies to provide broader bandwidth, and the deployment of massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with large antenna arrays to compensate for propagation losses and enhance spatial multiplexing. These advancements significantly extend the Rayleigh distance, enabling near-field (NF) propagation alongside the traditional far-field (FF) regime. As user communication distances dynamically span both FF and NF regions, cross-field (CF) communication has also emerged as a practical consideration. Beam management (BM)-including beam scanning, channel state information estimation, beamforming, and beam tracking-plays a central role in maintaining reliable directional communications. While most existing BM techniques are developed for FF channels, recent works begin to address the unique characteristics of NF and CF regimes. This survey presents a comprehensive review of BM techniques from the perspective of propagation fields. We begin by building the basic through analyzing the modeling of FF, NF, and CF channels, along with the associated beam patterns for alignment. Then, we categorize BM techniques by methodologies, and discuss their operational differences across propagation regimes, highlighting how field-dependent channel characteristics influence design tradeoffs and implementation complexity. In addition, for each BM method, we identify open challenges and future research directions, including extending FF methods to NF or CF scenarios, developing unified BM strategies for field-agnostic deployment, and designing low-overhead BM solutions for dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for I/O Relation in Zak-OTFS with Different Delay-Doppler Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver, involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O) relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx filter (referred to as `identical filtering'), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the Tx filter (referred to as `matched filtering'), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as `channel matched filtering'). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A) channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Iterative Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and adversarial training.</description>

      <title>SA-MIMO: Scalable Quantum-Based Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.</description>

      <title>UNet with Axial Transformer : A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67, SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.</description>

      <title>Constrained Parameter Update Law for Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Analysis for NOMA-Assisted Grant-Free Transmissions with Randomly Arrived Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to grant-free transmissions to reduce the age of information (AoI) in uplink status update systems, where multiple sources upload their {status updates} to {a common} receiver. Unlike existing studies which {adopted} the idealized generate-at-will (GAW) model, {i.e., a status} update data can be generated and transmitted at any time, this paper utilizes a more practical model {to characterize} the inherent randomness of the generation of the status updating data packets. A rigorous analytical framework is established to precisely evaluate the average AoI achieved by the NOMA-assisted grant-free schemes for both {the} cases with and without retransmission. The impact of the choice of the probability {of transmission} on the average AoI is investigated. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the developed analysis. It is shown that NOMA-assisted schemes are more superior in reducing AoI{, compared} to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. In addition, compared to schemes without retransmission, the AoI performance {of} the schemes with retransmission can {be improved} significantly when the status update generation rate is low or the user density is relatively high.</description>

      <title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent (APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.</description>

      <title>A Unified Benchmark of Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for medical imaging task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale machine learning architectures such as large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless networks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE framework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing resource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across diverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE, including various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI (GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive applications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications, heterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile edge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical layer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and security are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview of open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support diverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future research directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training techniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with emerging 6G technologies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Evasion Attacks in Federated Learning-Based Signal Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in leveraging federated learning (FL) for radio signal classification (SC) tasks has shown promise but FL-based SC remains susceptible to model poisoning adversarial attacks. These adversarial attacks mislead the ML model training process, damaging ML models across the network and leading to lower SC performance. In this work, we seek to mitigate model poisoning adversarial attacks on FL-based SC by proposing the Underlying Server Defense of Federated Learning (USD-FL). Unlike existing server-driven defenses, USD-FL does not rely on perfect network information, i.e., knowing the quantity of adversaries, the adversarial attack architecture, or the start time of the adversarial attacks. Our proposed USD-FL methodology consists of deriving logits for devices' ML models on a reserve dataset, comparing pair-wise logits via 1-Wasserstein distance and then determining a time-varying threshold for adversarial detection. As a result, USD-FL effectively mitigates model poisoning attacks introduced in the FL network. Specifically, when baseline server-driven defenses do have perfect network information, USD-FL outperforms them by (i) improving final ML classification accuracies by at least 6%, (ii) reducing false positive adversary detection rates by at least 10%, and (iii) decreasing the total number of misclassified signals by over 8%. Moreover, when baseline defenses do not have perfect network information, we show that USD-FL achieves accuracies of approximately 74.1% and 62.5% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, outperforming existing server-driven baselines, which achieve 52.1% and 39.2% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Weight-aware-based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Human Motion Intention Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of human motion intention (HMI) is beneficial for exoskeleton robots to improve the wearing comfort level and achieve natural human-robot interaction. A classifier trained on labeled source subjects (domains) performs poorly on unlabeled target subject since the difference in individual motor characteristics. The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method has become an effective way to this problem. However, the labeled data are collected from multiple source subjects that might be different not only from the target subject but also from each other. The current UDA methods for HMI recognition ignore the difference between each source subject, which reduces the classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper considers the differences between source subjects and develops a novel theory and algorithm for UDA to recognize HMI, where the margin disparity discrepancy (MDD) is extended to multi-source UDA theory and a novel weight-aware-based multi-source UDA algorithm (WMDD) is proposed. The source domain weight, which can be adjusted adaptively by the MDD between each source subject and target subject, is incorporated into UDA to measure the differences between source subjects. The developed multi-source UDA theory is theoretical and the generalization error on target subject is guaranteed. The theory can be transformed into an optimization problem for UDA, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. Moreover, a lightweight network is employed to guarantee the real-time of classification and the adversarial learning between feature generator and ensemble classifiers is utilized to further improve the generalization ability. The extensive experiments verify theoretical analysis and show that WMDD outperforms previous UDA methods on HMI recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Bandwidth Estimation from Level-Crossing Samples via LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for instantaneous bandwidth estimation from level-crossing (LC) samples using a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder architecture. LC sampling is a nonuniform sampling technique that is particularly useful for energy-efficient acquisition of signals with sparse spectra. Especially in combination with fully analog wireless sensor nodes, LC sampling offers a viable alternative to traditional sampling methods. However, due to the nonuniform distribution of samples, reconstructing the original signal is a challenging task. One promising reconstruction approach is time-warping, where the local signal spectrum is taken into account. However, this requires an accurate estimate of the instantaneous bandwidth of the signal. In this paper, we show that applying a neural network to the problem of estimating instantaneous bandwidth from LC samples can improve the overall reconstruction accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it to an intensity-based bandwidth estimation method from literature.</description>

      <title>A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of ultra-wideband (UWB) communications for short ranges (up to a few tens of meters) has been around for nearly three decades. However, despite significant efforts by the industry, UWB deployment has not yet reached its predicted potential. This article, thus, seeks to rectify this situation by providing a practical examination of UWB interference conditions. Through a spectrum survey of today's wireless environments, we quantify the level of interference that UWB devices may face and explore the signal processing steps that must be taken to materialize the full potential of UWB communications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Process Noise in LTV Systems via Kernel Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the identification of the process noise density of a linear time-varying system described by the state-space model with the known measurement noise density. A novel method is proposed that enhances the measurement difference method (MDM). The proposed method relies on a refined calculation of the MDM residue, which accounts for both process and measurement noises, as well as constructing the kernel density of the residue sample. The process noise density is then estimated by the density deconvolution algorithm utilising the Fourier transform. The method is supplemented with automatic selection of the deconvolution parameters based on the method of moments. The performance of process noise density estimation is evaluated in numerical examples and the paper is supplemented with a MATLAB implementation.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Beam Training and Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation challenge in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communication systems. Current channel estimation techniques require substantial pilot overhead and computational complexity, especially when the number of RIS elements is extremely large. To address this issue, we introduce a two-timescale channel estimation strategy that leverages the asymmetric coherence times of both the RIS-base station (BS) channel and the User-RIS channel. We derive a time-scaling property indicating that, for any two effective channels within the longer coherence time, one effective channel can be represented as the product of a vector, termed the small-timescale effective channel, and the other effective channel. By integrating the estimated effective channel from the initial time block with observations from our piecewise beam training, we present an efficient method for estimating subsequent small-timescale effective channels. We theoretically verify the efficacy of the proposed RIS design and demonstrate, through simulations, that our channel estimation method outperforms existing methods in pilot overhead and computational complexity across various realistic channel models.</description>

      <title>Perception-Guided EEG Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach Inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Flat-Top Beamforming with Efficient Array-Fed RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat-top beam designs are essential for uniform power distribution over a wide angular sector for applications such as 5G/6G networks, beaconing, satellite communications, radar systems, etc. Low sidelobe levels with steep transitions allow negligible cross sector illumination. Active array designs requiring amplitude taper suffer from poor power amplifier utilization. Phase only designs, e.g., Zadoff-Chu or generalized step chirp polyphase sequence methods, often require large active antenna arrays which in turns increases the hardware complexity and reduces the energy efficiency. In our recently proposed novel array-fed reflective intelligent surface (RIS) architecture, the small ($2 \times 2$) active array has uniform (principal eigenmode) amplitude weighting. We now present a pragmatic flat-top pattern design method for practical array (RIS) sizes, which outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of design superiority, energy efficiency, and deployment feasibility. This novel design holds promise for advancing sustainable wireless technologies in next-generation communication systems, including applications such as beaconing, broadcast signaling, and hierarchical beamforming, while mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>MVCNet: Multi-View Contrastive Network for Motor Imagery Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer models to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Long QT Syndrome and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block using Single-Lead AI-ECG: A Multi-Center Real-World Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Home-based single-lead AI-ECG devices have enabled continuous, real-world cardiac monitoring. However, the accuracy of parameter calculations from single-lead AI-ECG algorithm remains to be fully validated, which is critical for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block (AVBI). In this multicenter study, we assessed FeatureDB, an ECG measurements computation algorithm, in the context of single-lead monitoring using three annotated datasets: PTB-XL+ (n=21,354), CSE (n=105), and HeartVoice-ECG-lite (n=369). FeatureDB showed strong correlation with standard ECG machines (12SL and Uni-G) in key measurements (PR, QRS, QT, QTc), and high agreement confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. In detecting LQTS (AUC=0.786) and AVBI (AUC=0.684), FeatureDB demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to commercial ECG systems (12SL: 0.859/0.716; Uni-G: 0.817/0.605), significantly outperforming ECGDeli (0.501/0.569). Notably, FeatureDB can operate locally on resource-limited devices, facilitating use in low-connectivity settings. These findings confirm the clinical reliability of FeatureDB for single-lead ECG diagnostics and highlight its potential to bridge traditional ECG diagnostics with wearable technology for scalable cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention.</description>

      <title>Conditional Electrocardiogram Generation Using Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders impacting the heart and circulatory system. These disorders are the foremost and continuously escalating cause of mortality worldwide. One of the main tasks when working with CVDs is analyzing and identifying pathologies on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a standard 10-second duration. Using machine learning (ML) in automatic ECG analysis increases CVD diagnostics' availability, speed, and accuracy. However, the most significant difficulty in developing ML models is obtaining a sufficient training dataset. Due to the limitations of medical data usage, such as expensiveness, errors, the ambiguity of labels, imbalance of classes, and privacy issues, utilizing synthetic samples depending on specific pathologies bypasses these restrictions and improves algorithm quality. Existing solutions for the conditional generation of ECG signals are mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and only a few papers consider the architectures based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), showing comparable results in recent works. This paper proposes the publicly available conditional Nouveau VAE model for ECG signal generation (cNVAE-ECG), which produces high-resolution ECGs with multiple pathologies. We provide an extensive comparison of the proposed model on various practical downstream tasks, including transfer learning scenarios showing an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) increase up to 2% surpassing GAN-like competitors.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13558v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at https://github.com/thinkxca/rul.</description>

      <title>Neyman-Pearson Detector for Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low power indoor wireless positioning system has been proposed. In this system, Zero-Energy-Devices (ZED) beacons are deployed in Indoor environments, and located on a map with unique broadcast identifiers. They harvest ambient energy to power themselves and backscatter ambient waves from cellular networks to send their identifiers. This paper presents a novel detection method for ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems, with an emphasis on performance evaluation through experimental setups and simulations. We introduce a Neyman-Pearson detection framework, which leverages a predefined false alarm probability to determine the optimal detection threshold. This method, applied to the analysis of backscatter signals in a controlled testbed environment, incorporates the use of BC sequences to enhance signal detection accuracy. The experimental setup, conducted on the FIT/CorteXlab testbed, employs a two-node configuration for signal transmission and reception. Key performance metrics, which is the peak-to-lobe ratio, is evaluated, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed detection model. The results demonstrate a detection system that effectively handles varying noise levels and identifies ZEDs with high reliability. The simulation results show the robustness of the model, highlighting its capacity to achieve desired detection performance even with stringent false alarm thresholds. This work paves the way for robust ZED detection in real-world scenarios, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technologies.</description>

Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.</description>

      <title>EM-GANSim: Real-time and Accurate EM Simulation Using Conditional GANs for 3D Indoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps. We evaluated our method on 15 complex 3D indoor environments, with 4 additional scenarios later included in the results, showcasing the generalizability of the model across diverse conditions. Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of \emph{any} state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</description>
