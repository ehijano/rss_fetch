      <title>From Global Value Chains to Local Jobs: Exploring FDI-induced Job Creation in EU-27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the differential impacts of global value chain (GVC) participation on foreign direct investment (FDI)-related job creation in EU-27, emphasizing the role of sector-specific and regional factors. The study is based on a rich set of project-level data on FDI-generated jobs. It utilizes a labor demand function estimated through GMM estimator to account for endogeneity. Results indicate that forward GVC participation significantly boosts FDI-related job creation by enhancing domestic value-added and production capacity. However, this effect is moderated by sector-specific characteristics such as productivity or wages. Conversely, backward GVC participation, characterized by reliance on foreign inputs, generally reduces FDI-generated jobs due to lower domestic labor requirements and diminished competitiveness. Despite this, the negative impact of backward GVC participation on employment becomes less significant when regional diversification is considered, highlighting the importance of regional factors like infrastructure and skilled labor. The study also finds that the impact of GVC participation on employment varies with EU membership status and sectoral characteristics, with old EU member states and high-tech sectors benefiting more from forward GVC integration. In contrast, new EU member states and low-tech sectors face greater challenges, particularly with backward GVC participation.</description>

      <title>Economic growth of cities: Does resource allocation matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how efficient resource reallocation across cities affects potential aggregate growth. Using optimal resource allocation models and data on 284 China's prefecture-level cities in the years 2003--2019, we quantitatively measure the cost of misallocation of resources. We show that average aggregate output gains from reallocating resources across nationwide cities to their efficient use are 1.349- and 1.287-fold in the perfect and imperfect allocation scenarios. We further provide evidence on the effects of administrative division adjustments and local allocation. This suggests that city-level adjustments can yield more aggregate gain and that the output gain from nationwide allocation is likely to be more substantial than that from local allocation. Policy implications are proposed to improve the resource allocation efficiency in China.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Overcome the Machine Penalty When Acting Fairly but Not When Acting Selfishly or Altruistically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social dilemmas where the collective and self-interests are at odds, people typically cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon termed the machine penalty. Overcoming this penalty is critical for successful human-machine collectives, yet current solutions often involve ethically-questionable tactics, like concealing machines' non-human nature. In this study, with 1,152 participants, we explore the possibility of closing this research question by using Large Language Models (LLMs), in scenarios where communication is possible between interacting parties. We design three types of LLMs: (i) Cooperative, aiming to assist its human associate; (ii) Selfish, focusing solely on maximizing its self-interest; and (iii) Fair, balancing its own and collective interest, while slightly prioritizing self-interest. Our findings reveal that, when interacting with humans, fair LLMs are able to induce cooperation levels comparable to those observed in human-human interactions, even when their non-human nature is fully disclosed. In contrast, selfish and cooperative LLMs fail to achieve this goal. Post-experiment analysis shows that all three types of LLMs succeed in forming mutual cooperation agreements with humans, yet only fair LLMs, which occasionally break their promises, are capable of instilling a perception among humans that cooperating with them is the social norm, and eliciting positive views on their trustworthiness, mindfulness, intelligence, and communication quality. Our findings suggest that for effective human-machine cooperation, bot manufacturers should avoid designing machines with mere rational decision-making or a sole focus on assisting humans. Instead, they should design machines capable of judiciously balancing their own interest and the interest of humans.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of the LEO Kind: Spillovers and Resilience in Partially-Automated Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic systems are becoming increasingly automated. How will automated objects interact with non-automated objects? How will partially-automated systems handle large disruptions? Low-Earth orbit (LEO) -- filled with thousands of automated and non-automated satellites and many more uncontrollable pieces of debris -- offers a useful laboratory for these questions. I exploit the COSMOS-1408 (C1408) anti-satellite missile test of November 2021 -- a large and exogenous shock to the orbital environment -- to study how an unexpected disruption affects a partially-automated traffic system. I use publicly-available close approach data, network theory, and an econometric analysis of the C1408 test to study the effect of close encounters with new fragments on the configuration of objects in orbit. I document spillover effects of close encounters with C1408 fragments, heterogeneity in impacts across operators, and changes in system-level resilience to new shocks. These results shed light on the nature of partially-automated traffic systems, and provide a basis for new models to anticipate and mitigate space traffic disruptions.</description>

      <title>Urbanization, economic development, and income distribution dynamics in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: India's urbanization is often characterized as particularly challenging and very unequal but systematic empirical analyses, comparable to other nations, have largely been lacking. Here, we characterize India's economic and human development along with changes in its personal income distribution as a function of the nation's growing urbanization. On aggregate, we find that India outperforms most other nations in the growth of various indicators of development with urbanization, including income and human development. These results are due in part to India's present low levels of urbanization but also demonstrate the transformational role of its cities in driving multi-dimensional development. To test these changes at the more local level, we study the income distributions of large Indian cities to find evidence for high positive growth in the lowest decile (poorest) of the population, enabling sharp reductions in poverty over time. We also test the hypothesis that inequality-reducing cities are more attractive destinations for rural migrants. Finally, we use income distributions to characterize changes in poverty rates directly. This shows much lower levels of poverty in urban India and especially in its largest cities. The dynamics of poverty rates during the recent COVID-19 pandemic shows both a high fragility of these improvements during a crisis and their resilience over longer times. Sustaining a long-term dynamic where urbanization continues to be closely associated with human development and poverty reduction is likely India's fastest path to a more prosperous and equitable future.</description>

      <title>Child Labour within the Family: Problems and Perspectives from Agricultural Labour Households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article, a field survey among the agricultural labour household in West Bengal reveals that nearly 46 per cent of children among the total child population (in the age group 5-14 years) during the reference period, are performed domestic chores and (or) economic activities within the family beyond their school hours. The study aims to examine the key determinants that might enhance welfare of children by reducing their domestic workload within the family. Based on field investigation in the district of Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, India, Probit regression analysis has been applied in the study. The model shows that possession of small land lowers the household tasks, whereas allied farm and non-farm activities in a family escalate the risk of higher working hours for the school-going children. The result further indicates that education of the mothers and accessibility of formal credit positively influence schooling of children by lessening their domestic workload.</description>

      <title>Urban-Rural Disparity in Educational Attainment in India: A Spatio-temporal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article tries to analyze the inter-state comparison of the urban-rural literacy of fifteen selected Indian states during the period between 1981 and 2011 and investigates the responsible determinants that can reduce the inequality in urban-rural educational attainment. The study constructs the Sopher index to analyze the Spatio temporal changes of literacy disparity across fifteen states in India over time. Although literacy disparity has decreased over time, Sopher index shows that the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and even Karnataka have faced higher inequality in education between urban and rural India in 2011. The Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) technique is applied in the study. The model explains that low level of fertility rate in rural women, the higher percentages of females who married after the age of 21 years, educational attainment of females (proxy of education of mothers) and labour force participation rate of males (proxy of income in the households of fathers) are the significant factors for the reduction of literacy disparity between urban and rural areas of India.</description>

      <title>The Use of Symmetry for Models with Variable-size Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08650v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows the universal representations of symmetric functions with multidimensional variable-size variables, which help assessing the justification of approximation methods aggregating the information of each variable by moments. It then discusses how the results give insights into game theoretic applications, including two-step policy function estimation, Moment-based Markov Equilibrium (MME), and aggregative games.
  Regarding policy function estimations, it is justifiable to estimate a common policy function as a function of own firm's states and the sums of polynomial terms (moments) of competitors' states under some conditions, regardless of the number of firms in each market, as long as the number of moments is sufficiently large. Concerning the MME, this study shows that MME is equivalent to the Markov Perfect Equilibrium if the number of moments reaches a certain level and regularity conditions are satisfied. Regarding aggregative games, we can easily show that any games satisfying a condition of symmetry and continuity of payoff functions can be represented as multidimensional generalized aggregative, which introduces multidimensional aggregates in the generalized (fully) aggregative games previous studies have intensively studied.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds of Uncertainty of Observations of Macroeconomic Variables and Upper Limits on the Accuracy of Their Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper defines theoretical lower bounds of uncertainty of observations of macroeconomic variables that depend on statistical moments and correlations of random values and volumes of market trades. Any econometric assessments of macroeconomic variables have greater uncertainty. We consider macroeconomic variables as random that depend on random values and volumes of trades. To predict random macroeconomic variables, one should forecast their probabilities. Upper limits on the accuracy of the forecasts of probabilities of macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns depend on the number of predicted statistical moments. We consider economic obstacles that limit by the first two the number of predicted statistical moments. The accuracy of any forecasts of probabilities of random macroeconomic variables, prices, returns, and market trades doesn't exceed the accuracy of Gaussian approximations. Any forecasts of macroeconomic variables have uncertainty higher than one determined by predictions of coefficients of variation of random values and volumes of trades.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Model of Performative Human-ML Collaboration: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various applications, from recommendation systems in e-commerce to diagnosis prediction in healthcare. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic framework for thinking about the deployment of ML models in a performative, human-ML collaborative system. In our framework, the introduction of ML recommendations changes the data-generating process of human decisions, which are only a proxy to the ground truth and which are then used to train future versions of the model. We show that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable points, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same performance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the actual ground truth. As a proof of concept, we conduct an empirical user study with 1,408 participants. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack problem with the help of machine learning predictions of varying performance. This is an ideal setting because we can identify the actual ground truth, and evaluate the performance of human decisions supported by ML recommendations. We find that for many levels of ML performance, humans can improve upon the ML predictions. We also find that the improvement could be even higher if humans rationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary incentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any positive effect. Using our empirical data to approximate our collaborative system suggests that the learning process would dynamically reach an equilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. Our results have practical implications for the deployment of ML models in contexts where human decisions may deviate from the indisputable ground truth.</description>
