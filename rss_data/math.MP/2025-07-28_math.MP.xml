      <title>Geometric Representation of Generalized Coherent States and their Symplectic Capacities: A Synthetic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we review, complete, and synthesize results linking generalized coherent stages (nondegradable Gaussian wavefunctions) to the notions of Fermi ellipsoids, quantum blobs, and microlocal pairs introduced in previous work. These geometric objects are Fermi ellipsoids, quantum blobs, and microlocal pairs. In addition we study various symplectic capacities associated with these objects.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints for topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series on {\it Virasoro constraints for Cohomological Field Theory}. We derive the ancestor Virasoro constraints for the topological recursion (TR) for an arbitrary spectral curve and establish the descendent Virasoro constraints for spectral curves satisfying certain conditions. For higher-genus curves, we further establish the corresponding ancestor and descendent Virasoro constraints for the associated non-perturbative generating series. We present several examples that illustrate the comparison between the descendent Virasoro constraints for TR descendent invariants and the original Virasoro constraints for geometric descendent invariants.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions of the open XYZ spin 1/2 chain with boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss how the matrix product solution for the steady state of the harmonic process is obtained from the solutions already known in the literature, i.e. the closed-form expression derived in arXiv:2107.01720 and the nested integral form obtained in arXiv:2307.02793 and arXiv:2307.14975. Our results clarify the relation between the three representations of the steady state and provide the matrix product solution that has not been available for this model before.</description>

      <title>Preliminary orbits with over-determined systems of Keplerian conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different choices of Keplerian conservation laws for the computation of preliminary orbits with two very short arcs (VSAs) of astrometric observations. In total we have 7 equations in 4 unknowns. Adding two auxiliary variables we can embed the full set of conservation laws into a polynomial system of 9 equations. This complete system generically has no solutions. However, combining these equations, in [10] the authors found an over-determined polynomial system that is consistent, and leads by variable elimination to a univariate polynomial $\mathsf{p}_9$ of degree 9 in one radial distance. In [9] the authors showed that this corresponds to taking a subsystem with 7 equations of the complete system. In this paper we consider all the other possibilities and we find two additional over-determined cases which are consistent and lead to a univariate polynomial $\mathsf{p}_{18}$ of degree 18 in the same variable as $\mathsf{p}_9$. In the other over-determined cases the corresponding system is inconsistent. We also present a method to compute an approximate gcd of $\mathsf{p}_9$ and $\mathsf{p}_{18}$, that can allow us to find preliminary orbits that approximately satisfy inconsistent systems of conservation laws, or to discard incompatible pairs of VSAs. We show this through some numerical tests with real asteroid data.</description>

      <title>Parallel athermal quasistatic deformation stepping of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The athermal quasistatic deformation method provides an elegant solution to overcome the limitation of short time spans in molecular simulations. It provides overdamped conditions, allowing for the extraction of purely structural responses in the absence of thermal vibration. However, it requires computationally expensive sequences of affine deformation followed by minimization of the potential energy to incrementally find the path in the potential energy landscape that corresponds to the correct solution trajectory. Therefore, we propose an athermal parallel stepping scheme that significantly improves the computational time necessary to find the correct solution trajectory using a multi-thread approach. Our approach proposes athermal stepping at two levels. Level I stepping provides a sequence of initial guesses at large increments by affine deformation of the system and land-marking anchor points on the potential energy landscape. Level II stepping performs a set of individual finely resolved athermal quasistatic deformation steps between the inherent structures of the initial level I guesses executed in parallel. The evaluated candidate trajectory is then verified by consecutively comparing the configuration of every last level II result with the corresponding inherent structure of the level I guesses at the same strain states. If the two configurations are not equivalent, the solution must be rejected and recalculated from this point. Rigorous numerical testing with $4,8,16$ and $32$ parallel threads demonstrates that our method achieves computational speed-ups of factors ranging from $1.49$ to $27.09$, with averages of $3.0$ to $6.62$ depending on the number of threads, while maintaining simulation accuracy, offering a powerful new tool for athermal molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>A new upper bound on the specific free energy of dilute Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the free energy (per unit volume) of the dilute Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit, showing that the free energy at density $\rho$ and inverse temperature $\beta$ differs from that of the non-interacting system by the correction term $4 \pi \frak{a} (2 \rho^2 - [\rho - \rho_{\textsf{c}}(\beta)]^2_+ )$. Here, $\frak{a}$ denotes the scattering length of the interaction potential, $\rho_{\textsf{c}}(\beta)$ the critical density for Bose-Einstein condensation of the non-interacting gas and $[\cdot]_+=\max\{0,\cdot\}$. This result was previously established by Yin in [37]. Our proof applies to a broader class of interaction potentials, yields a better rate, and we believe it has potential for further extensions.</description>

      <title>Noise-expansion cascade: an origin of randomness of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14941v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness is one of the most important characteristics of turbulence, but its origin remains an open question. By means of a ``thought experiment'' via several clean numerical experiments based on the Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal a new phenomenon, which we call the ``noise-expansion cascade'' whereby all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitudes in the initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level. More importantly, each noise/disturbance input may greatly change the macro-level characteristics and statistics of the resulting turbulence, clearly indicating that micro-level noise/disturbance might have great influence on macro-level characteristics and statistics of turbulence. Besides, the noise-expansion cascade closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence, thus revealing an origin of randomness of turbulence. This also highly suggests that unavoidable thermal fluctuations must be considered when simulating turbulence, even if such fluctuations are several orders of magnitudes smaller than other external environmental disturbances. Hopefully, the ``noise-expansion cascade'' as a fundamental property of the NS equations could greatly deepen our understandings about turbulence, and besides is helpful for attacking the fourth millennium problem posed by Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical noise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic systems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that numerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence on turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly polluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has huge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isospectral higher-order Hamiltonians via a reversed Lax pair construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for constructing quasi-isospectral higher-order Hamiltonians from time-independent Lax pairs by reversing the conventional interpretation of the Lax pair operators. Instead of treating the typically second-order $L$-operator as the Hamiltonian, we take the higher-order $M$-operator as the starting point and construct a sequence of quasi-isospectral operators via intertwining techniques. This procedure yields a variety of new higher-order Hamiltonians that are isospectral to each other, except for at least one state. We illustrate the approach with explicit examples derived from the KdV equation and its extensions, discussing the properties of the resulting operators based on rational, hyperbolic, and elliptic function solutions. In some cases, we present infinite sequences of quasi-isospectral Hamiltonians, which we generalise to shape-invariant differential operators capable of generating such sequences. Our framework provides a systematic mechanism for generating new integrable systems from known Lax pairs.</description>

      <title>Slow-Fast Evolution of Scalar Fields in Higher-Order Cosmological Gravity: Dynamics Inspired by the Pais--Uhlenbeck Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields governed by higher-order gravity, with particular emphasis on models inspired by the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator--a prototypical fourth-order system known for its connection to ghost-free formulations. By recasting the field equations into a slow-fast dynamical system, we analyze phase space evolution across exponential and power-law coupling regimes. Our approach integrates numerical simulations and geometric methods to visualize trajectories, stream flows, and asymptotic behavior under varying potential parameters. The underlying system admits singular surfaces and non-smooth transitions, revealing intricate dynamical structures. We examine the stability of de Sitter solutions, the crossing of the phantom divide, and the emergence of cyclic behavior through multiple-scale analysis. The inclusion of radiation and dust fluids enables the creation of realistic cosmological scenarios, including a transient matter-dominated era and a late-time accelerated expansion. Our results highlight the viability of Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in accounting for inflationary dynamics and dark energy, offering diagnostic tools for characterizing attractors and bifurcation phenomena in higher-derivative cosmology.</description>

      <title>On Nilpotent and Solvable Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the structure of nilpotent Lie groups and unimodular solvable Lie groups with quasi-Einstein metric $(M,g,X)$ when $X$ is a left-invariant vector field. We define such a metric as a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric. We prove that any non-flat unimodular solvable Lie group $S$ with a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric, must have one-dimensional center. Along with this, if the adjoint action $ad_a$ of $S$ is a normal derivation, then $S$ must be standard, and have a quasi-Einstein nilpotent group as its nilradical. We also establish some necessary conditions for a nilpotent Lie group to be totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein. We prove that any left-invariant metric on Heisenberg Lie group is quasi-Einstein, and these are the only two-step nilpotent Lie groups that admit a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric. We also obtain a structure theorem for quasi-Einstein compact manifolds $\Gamma\backslash G,$ where $G$ is unimodular solvable and $\Gamma$ is its discrete cocompact subgroup. As a consequence of these results, we prove that the only non-Abelian nilpotent Lie groups that admit a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric and a discrete compact quotient, up to dimension six, are the 3-dimensional and 5-dimensional Heisenberg groups.</description>

Abstract: A symmetric $\phi^4$-$\phi^2 |\phi|$-$\phi^2$ model has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its usefulness in studying tunable phase transitions. We analyze the behavior of this model for the entire range of parameters and obtain its kink and pulse solutions. For completeness, we also present several periodic solutions of this model. Furthermore, we present a generalized symmetric $\phi^{4n}$-$\phi^{2n}|\phi|$-$\phi^2$ model where $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$ and obtain its kink and pulse solutions for arbitrary $n$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Parameter Families of Spin Chains: A Discrete MPS Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and compatibility with subgroup structures.</description>

      <title>Resurgent structure of 2d Yang-Mills theory on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the resurgent structure of the topological string dual to 2d $U(N)$ Yang-Mills on torus. We find closed form formulas for instanton amplitudes up to arbitrarily high instanton orders, based on which we propose the non-perturbative partition function including contributions from all the real instantons, which is real for positive modulus and string coupling. We also explore complex instantons and find two infinite towers of them. We expect them to correspond to BPS states in type II string.</description>

      <title>Feed-anywhere ANN (I) Steady Discrete $\to$ Diffusing on Graph Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data using geometric analysis and nonlinear dynamics. Our approach: (1) Defines discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization. Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery), metric convergence (Gromov--Hausdorff), and efficient search space utilization. Our dynamics-based model achieves stronger generalization bounds than standard neural networks, with complexity dependent on the data manifold's topology.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras as important generalizations of Hopf brace, post Hopf algebra and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras respectively. We also discuss their relationships. Explicitly under the condition of cocomutativity, Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras could be mutually obtained, and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras could lead to Hopf group braces.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an $N \times N$ random band matrix $H = \left(H_{xy}\right)$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x, y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile $\mathbb{E}\left|H_{xy}\right|^2 = S_{xy}$ vanishes when the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a given bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if the bandwidth satisfies $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large $N$ limit, both the delocalization of bulk eigenvectors and a local semicircle law down to optimal spectral scales $\eta \ge N^{-1+\varepsilon}$ hold with high probability. Our proof is based on the primitive approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718), and builds upon methods which were developed in this series since 2021 (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2501.01718, arXiv:2503.07606).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

Abstract: We provide quantitative improvements to the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and the Kr\"oger inequality, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

Abstract: We discuss free differential algebras (FDA's), a generalization of the Cartan-Maurer equations for the group manifold vielbein, appropriate for theories containing $p$-forms ($p &gt;1$). Their dual formulation is an extension of Lie algebras, called $L_\infty$ algebras, and we illustrate this duality in a simple example. Finally we review the FDA structure and the dual $L_\infty$ structure of $d=11$ supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the explicit rate of convergence $N^{-1/2 + \epsilon}$ for the gaps of generalized Wigner matrices in the bulk of the spectrum, for distributions of matrix entries possibly atomic and supported on enough points. The proof proceeds by a Green function comparison, coupled with the relaxation estimate from [5]. In particular, we extend the 4 moment matching method [33] to arbitrary moments, allowing to compare resolvents down to the submicroscopic scale $N^{-3/2 + \epsilon}$. This method also gives universality of the smallest gaps between eigenvalues for the Hermitian symmetry class, providing a universal, optimal separation of eigenvalues for discrete random matrices with entries supported on $\Omega(1)$ points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a reduced order affine map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for studying the newly discovered solar inertial oscillations, offering promising new avenues for exploring the Sun's dynamics. Under the assumption of purely toroidal motions, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation governing inertial waves on the rotating Sun. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface observations. To this end, we verify the tangential cone condition, ensuring the convergence of iterative regularization methods. Numerical experiments employing the Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm robustness of the reconstruction across different observation schemes and noise levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the incompatibility of random quantum measurements. Most previous work has focused on characterizing the maximal amount of white noise that any fixed number of incompatible measurements with a fixed number of outcomes in a fixed dimension can tolerate before becoming compatible. This can be used to quantify the maximal amount of incompatibility available in such systems. The present article investigates the incompatibility of several classes of random measurements, i.e., the generic amount of incompatibility available. In particular, we show that for an appropriate choice of parameters, both random dichotomic projective measurements and random basis measurements are close to being maximally incompatible. We use the technique of incompatibility witnesses to certify incompatibility and combine it with tools from random matrices and free probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical investigation of colliding ion-acoustic (IA) shock waves in Martian multicomponent plasmas consisting of hydrogen ($H^+$), oxygen ($O^+$) and oxygen molecule ($O_2^+$) ions, including background superthermal electrons (modeled by a $\kappa$-(kappa) distribution function). A set of Burgers' equations is obtained by adopting a modified Poincar\'e-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK) perturbation method to describe the head-on-collision dynamics of dissipative nonlinear IA wave structures. We have estimated the spatio-temporal scales using parameters typically observed in the Martian atmosphere by the MAVEN spacecraft, for which shock waves are theoretically expected to undergo mutual collisions in the multicomponent plasma. The effects of head-on collisions on the electrostatic potential profiles arising from one-fold and two-fold IA shock interactions are explored. Our numerical analysis reveals that the collision leads to a noticeable broadening of the shock structures with the enhancement of kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>Continuity Norm Framework for the Evolution of Nonsingular Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix theory, foundational in diverse fields such as mathematics, physics, and computational sciences, typically categorizes matrices based strictly on their invertibility-determined by a sharply defined singular or nonsingular classification. However, such binary classifications become inadequate in describing matrices whose elements vary continuously over time, thereby transitioning through intermediate states near singular configurations. To address this fundamental limitation, we develop a rigorous and original mathematical theory termed Continuity Norm Framework for the Evolution of Nonsingular Matrices. Within this framework, we introduce a novel mathematical structure enabling continuous and differentiable transitions between singular and nonsingular matrix states, explicitly governed by a specialized continuity norm and evolution operators derived through a well-defined differential formulation. Our theoretical formalism rigorously quantifies the proximity of a matrix to singularity, alongside its temporal evolution, through precisely constructed functional relationships involving determinants and their time derivatives. Furthermore, we elucidate the direct applicability and relevance of our approach to physical systems by demonstrating how our formalism can seamlessly describe continuous quantum state transitions-scenarios frequently encountered but insufficiently captured by existing matrix theory. The theory presented herein is meticulously constructed to maintain mathematical exactitude, comprehensive rigor, and broad accessibility, bridging advanced mathematical innovation and clear interpretability for the wider scientific community.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>Holography on Biregular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a discrete model of holography on biregular trees, which are discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. For a scalar field theory on biregular trees, the bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space and negatively curved space.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
  reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the $(2+1)$-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator coupled to an external magnetic field, in which we change the standard partial derivatives for the Dunkl derivatives. We find the energy spectrum (Landau levels) in an algebraic way, by introducing three operators that close the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra and from the theory of unitary representations. Also we find the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions analytically, and we show that both solutions are consistent. Finally, we demonstrate that when the magnetic field vanishes or when the parameters of the Dunkl derivatives are set zero, our results are adequately reduced to those reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard perturbation theory of eigenvalue problems consists of obtaining approximations of eigenmodes in the neighborhood of an operator where the corresponding eigenmode is known. Nevertheless, if the corresponding eigenmodes of several nearby operators are known, standard perturbation theory cannot simultaneously use all this knowledge to provide a better approximation. We derive a resolvent formula enabling such an approximation result, and provide numerical examples for which this method is more competitive than standard perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Localization and unique continuation for non-stationary Schr\"odinger operators on the 2D lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend methods of Ding and Smart from their breakthrough paper in 2020 which showed Anderson localization for certain random Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ via a quantitative unique continuation principle and Wegner estimate. We replace the requirement of identical distribution with the requirement of a uniform bound on the essential range of potential and a uniform positive lower bound on the variance of the variables giving the potential. Under those assumptions, we recover the unique continuation and Wegner lemma results, using Bernoulli decompositions and modifications of the arguments therein. This leads to a localization result at the bottom of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of the spherical pure-like mixed p-spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large $N$-dimensional limit of the Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of some subclasses of the spherical mixed $p$-spin models. Specifically, we show that its empirical spectral measure converges in probability to a shifted and rescaled semicircle law and does not have outliers. Our method follows the second moment approach developed recently in \cite{BSZ20}, from which the ground state energy can be derived for the $pure$-$like$ mixed $p$-spin model. By analyzing the complexity function with given radial derivative and energy, we derive the convergence of the Hessian spectrum from the vanishing mean number of critical points. For the $1$-RSB model, the ground state energy was explicitly computed in \cite{huang2023constructive}. Combined with the complexity function of local maxima with given radial derivative obtained in \cite{belius2022complexity}, this allows us to obtain the corresponding results more directly. Our result extends those corresponding results in the regime of topology trivialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an equivalence of categories between: (i) M\"obius vertex algebras which are equipped with a choice of generating family of quasiprimary vectors, and (ii) (not-necessarily-unitary) M\"obius-covariant Wightman conformal field theories on the unit circle. We do not impose any technical restrictions on the theories considered (such as finite-dimensional conformal weight spaces or simplicity), yielding the most general equivalence between these two axiomatizations of two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory. This provides new opportunities to study non-unitary vertex algebras using the lens of algebraic conformal field theory and operator algebras, which we demonstrate by establishing a non-unitary version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Bose gas in the three-dimensional unit torus, where $N$ particles interact via a two-body potential of the form $N^{-1} v(x)$. The system is studied at inverse temperatures of order $N^{-2/3}$, which corresponds to the temperature scale of the Bose--Einstein condensation phase transition. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system exhibits Bose--Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: We address the question whether hard-core bosons, equivalent to the XX-model, remain integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider the lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show, using random matrix theory, that the statistics of the complex spacial ratios indicate that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe pattern in the Lindbladian spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This works presents a mathematical model of an adsorption column to study the evolution of contaminant concentration and adsorbed quantity along the column's longitudinal axis. The model, described by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), is analysed using a travelling wave approach, which transforms the system into a second-order ordinary differential equation dependent on the inverse P\'eclet number, typically small. The model is simplified by means of a singular perturbation to a leading-order approximation by assuming a negligible inverse P\'eclet number, which can be regarded as a slow-fast system. By analytical continuation, we conclude that, at least for small values of the inverse P\'eclet number, the concentration varies from the clean state of the adsorbent matrix to a full saturation. We present numerical simulations to illustrate the analytical results for different P\'eclet number values and conduct a sensitivity analysis that demonstrates the system's robustness.</description>

Abstract: We extend the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator by changing the standard derivative by the Dunkl derivative. We demonstrate in a general way that for the Dirac-Dunkl oscillator be parity invariant, one of the spinor component must be even, and the other spinor component must be odd, and vice versa. We decouple the differential equations for each of the spinor component and introduce an appropriate $su(1,1)$ algebraic realization for the cases when one of these functions is even and the other function is odd. The eigenfunctions and the energy spectrum are obtained by using the $su(1,1)$ irreducible representation theory. Finally, by setting the Dunkl parameter to vanish, we show that our results reduce to those of the standard Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger Equation with Dunkl Derivative for the Free-Particle Spherical Waves, the Pseudo-Harmonic Oscillator and the Mie-type Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.04461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve exactly the Schr\"odinger equation for the free-particle, the pseudo-harmonic oscillator and the Mie-type potential in three dimensions with the Dunkl derivative. The equations for the radial and angular parts are obtained by using spherical coordinates and separation of variables. The wave functions and the energy spectrum for these potentials are derived in an analytical way and it is shown that our results are adequately reduced to those previously reported when we remove the Dunkl derivative parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations with super-critical dissipation. For large initial data in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces, we prove optimal Gevrey regularity with the same decay exponent as the linear part. This settles several open problems in \cite{Bis14, BMS15}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic entanglement entropy scaling properties usually come with interesting entanglement structures in real space and novel metrics of the spacetime lattice. One prominent example is the rainbow chain where lattice sites symmetric about the center form entangled Bell pairs due to an effective long-range coupling from the strong inhomogeneity of the coupling strength. This manuscript generalizes the rainbow chain to higher dimensional space on lattices with Hausdorff dimension one and enlarged local Hilbert space keeping the Hamiltonian frustration free. The effective Hamiltonian from the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation is given by a stacking of layers of $k$-simplices with $0$-dimensional (fully-connected) antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians, which can be diagonalized analytically with Young operators. The original lattice can be obtained from proliferating disinclination defects in a regular $k$-dimensional cubical lattice, which introduces curvature at the center of the lattice. The model interpolates between the SYK model and the free-fermionic XX spin chain, and hence might be potentially useful in understanding black hole physics and holography.</description>

      <title>Twisted traces on abelian quantum Higgs and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules, confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum Hikita isomorphism.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on geodesic length in 2D critical first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider i.i.d. first-passage percolation (FPP) on the two-dimensional square lattice, in the critical case where edge-weights take the value zero with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Critical FPP is unique in that the Euclidean lengths of geodesics are superlinear -- rather than linear -- in the distance between their endpoints. This fact was speculated by Kesten in 1986 but not confirmed until 2019 by Damron and Tang, who showed a lower bound on geodesic length that is polynomial with degree strictly greater than $1$. In this paper, we establish the first nontrivial upper bound. Namely, we prove that for a large class of critical edge-weight distributions, the shortest geodesic from the origin to a box of radius $R$ uses at most $R^{2+\epsilon}\pi_3(R)$ edges with high probability, for any $\epsilon&gt; 0$. Here $\pi_3(R)$ is the polychromatic 3-arm probability from classical Bernoulli percolation; upon inserting its conjectural asymptotic, our bound converts to $R^{4/3 + \epsilon}$. In any case, it is known that $\pi_3(R) \lesssim R^{-\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, so our bound gives an exponent strictly less than $2$. In the special case of Bernoulli($\tfrac{1}{2}$) edge-weights, we replace the additional factor of $R^\epsilon$ with a constant and give an expectation bound.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of shallow neural networks and constructive ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we approach the problem of cost (loss) minimization in underparametrized shallow ReLU networks through the explicit construction of upper bounds which appeal to the structure of classification data, without use of gradient descent. A key focus is on elucidating the geometric structure of approximate and precise minimizers. We consider an $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost function, input space $\mathbb{R}^M$, output space ${\mathbb R}^Q$ with $Q\leq M$, and training input sample size that can be arbitrarily large. We prove an upper bound on the minimum of the cost function of order $O(\delta_P)$ where $\delta_P$ measures the signal-to-noise ratio of training data. In the special case $M=Q$, we explicitly determine an exact degenerate local minimum of the cost function, and show that the sharp value differs from the upper bound obtained for $Q\leq M$ by a relative error $O(\delta_P^2)$. The proof of the upper bound yields a constructively trained network; we show that it metrizes a particular $Q$-dimensional subspace in the input space ${\mathbb R}^M$. We comment on the characterization of the global minimum of the cost function in the given context.</description>

      <title>Dual-unitary shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>The dynamical $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length $ L $, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0 &lt; \alpha \le 1 $, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. This result arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of $\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $, and moreover to initial pure states with low entanglement, of order $ \log L $, that are typically represented by critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \log L $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian of two isotropic oscillators with weak coupling from an algebraic approach. We write the Hamiltonian of this problem in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ and $SU(2)$ groups. This allows us to apply two tilting transformations based on both group similarity transformations to obtain its energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Then, we obtain the Mandel $Q$-parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^2(0)$ of the photon numbers $n_a$ and $n_b$. It is important to note that in our procedure we consider the case of weak coupling.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries II: Noether Realization in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the gravitational phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid $\mathcal{T}$ which allows us to include radiation in an algebraic framework. We show that $\mathcal{T}$ admits a non-linear realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. Besides, this Noether charge is conserved in the absence of radiation. Moreover, at non radiative cuts, the algebroid can be restricted to the wedge symmetry algebra studied in ArXiv:2409.12178. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is also represented canonically.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation. The class of equations considered includes the situation where the particle evolution is governed by Hamiltonian dynamics with additional damping and noise satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Also covered are systems of two equations describing an evolution of interacting agents, as arising in several descriptions of active matter, including models for flocking and swarming. We first show that such particle systems can be represented exactly by so-called equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which in this case are stochastic versions of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck type equation. While the derivation given here is simple, it is a blueprint for the rigorous derivation of equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. We then show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive (first order) systems carries over to the second order setting considered here: Solutions exist for suitable atomic initial data, in which case the solution is, properly scaled, the empirical density describing the particle system. For smooth initial data, however, we prove that no solution exists.</description>

      <title>Fractal zeta functions at infinity and the $\phi$-shell Minkowski content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of unbounded domains with infinite Lebesgue measure via their complex fractal dimensions. These complex dimensions are defined as poles of a suitable defined Lapidus fractal zeta function at infinity and are a generalization of the Minkowski dimension for a special kind of a degenerated relative fractal drum at infinity. It is a natural generalization of a similar approach applied to unbounded domains of finite Lebesgue measures investigated previously by the author. In this case we adapt the definition of Minkowski content and dimension at infinity by introducing the so-called $\phi$-shells where $\phi$ is a real parameter. We show that the new notion of the upper $\phi$-shell Minkowski dimension is independent on the paramter $\phi$ and well adapted to the fractal zeta function at infinity. We also study how the new definition connects with the one-point compactification and the classical fractal properties of the corresponding compactified domain. We also give a construction of maximally hyperfractal and of quasperiodic domains at infinity of infinite Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetric binary perceptron ($\mathrm{SBP}_{\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\kappa : \mathbb{R}_{\geq1} \to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\mathbf{A} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \times m}$ as input where $m \geq n$, output a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \{-1,1\}^m$ such that $$|| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} ||_{\infty} \leq \kappa(m/n) \cdot \sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($\mathrm{NPP}_{\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.
  In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{SBP}$, for large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is $\kappa(x) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020), which is a far cry from the statistical bound. The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\kappa(x) = \widetilde{\Theta}(1/\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. We prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{NPP}$, Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\log^2 m)}~.$ We prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\kappa(m) = 2^{-\Omega(\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</description>

      <title>On three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the $SO ({\cal N})$ superspace formulation for $\cal N$-extended conformal supergravity in three dimensions, we derive all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\cal N} =4$ case. The specific feature of this choice is that the so-called super Cotton tensor $X^{IJKL} = X^{[IJKL]}$, which exists for ${\cal N} \geq 4$, is equivalent to the scalar $X$ defined by $X^{IJKL} = \varepsilon^{IJKL} X$. This scalar may be used as a deformation parameter. In the family of $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces with $p+q=4$, it is known that $X\neq 0$ exists only if $p=4$ and $q=0$. In general, the $(4,0)$ AdS superspaces are characterised by the structure group $SL(2,{\mathbb R}) \times SO (4)$ and their geometry is determined by two constant parameters, $S$ and $X$, of which the former determines the AdS curvature, while the $R$-symmetry curvature is determined by the parameters $(X+2S)$ and $(X-2S)$ in the left and right sectors of $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$, respectively. Setting $S=0$ leads to the so-called deformed ${\cal N}=4$ Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ introduced thirteen years ago. We construct general interacting supersymmetric field theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ and demonstrate that they originate as massive deformations of the following two families of ${\cal N} =4$ theories in standard Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$: (i) ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories; and (ii) ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$ which are not superconformal but possess the $R$-symmetry group $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$. Extensions of the theories in (ii) to ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ necessarily contain Chern-Simons terms at the component level. We also demonstrate the generation of topologically massive ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories from radiative corrections in the hypermultiplet sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. The actions feature a generalization of the Nieh-Yan topological term for a varying coupling constant. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge $+$ matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. The action becomes asymptotically topological when the gauge action contribution to dark energy vanishes.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Domain Decomposition Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Double Fourier Sphere Methods with Low Rank Approximation for Block Copolymer Systems on Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce spectral methods for the Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) and Nakazawa-Ohta (NO) models on a spherical domain, examining their coarsening dynamics and equilibrium pattern formations. We employed the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method for spatial discretization and the second-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) scheme for time evolution, resulting in an efficient energy-stable scheme to simulate the OK and NO models on the unit sphere. Our numerical experiments reveal various self-assembled patterns, such as single-bubble assemblies in binary systems and double-bubble and mixed-bubble assemblies in ternary systems. These patterns closely resemble experimental biomembrane patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the OK model in real-world applications. Additionally, our study explores the relationship between repulsive strength and the number of bubbles in assemblies, confirming the two-thirds law in the OK model. This provides quantitative evidence of how self-assembled patterns depend on system parameters in copolymer systems.</description>

      <title>A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Slavnov Overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free fermions.</description>
