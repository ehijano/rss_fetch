      <title>On the Derivation of One and Two Dimensional Equations for Layered Elastic Beams and Plates with Interface Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mindlins systematic procedure of power series expansion for deriving one and two dimensional equations of elastic beams and plates is extended to layered beams and plates with interface slips by adding a step function term to the power series expansion. A two layer beam is used as an example. In addition to the usual one dimensional equations for extension, bending and shear deformation, an equation associated with the interface slip also results from the procedure.</description>

      <title>On the Damped Pinney Equation from Noether Symmetry Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several versions of the damped form of the celebrated Pinney equation, which is the natural partner of the undamped time-dependent harmonic oscillator. In this work these dissipative versions of the Pinney equation are briefly reviewed. We show that Noether's theorem for the usual time-dependent harmonic oscillator as a guiding principle for derivation of the Pinney equation also works in the damped case, selecting a Noether symmetry based damped Pinney equation. The results are extended to general nonlinear damped Ermakov systems. A certain time-rescaling always allows to remove the damping from the final equations.</description>

      <title>Realization of an NMR analog in a microwave network with symplectic symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we realized a microwave network with symplectic symmetry simulating a spin 1/2 (Rehemanjiang et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 064101 (2016)]), following a suggestion by Joyner et al. [Europhys. Lett. 107, 50004(2014))]. The network consisted of two identical sub-units coupled by a pair of bonds with a length difference corresponding to a phase difference of $\pi$ for the waves traveling through the bonds. In such a symmetry each eigenvalue appears as a two-fold degenerate Kramers doublet. Distorting the symmetry the degeneracy is lifted which may be interpreted in terms of the Zeeman splitting of a spin 1/2 in an external magnetic field. In the present work, a microwave analog of a spin resonance is realized. To this end, two magnetic fields have to be emulated, a static and a radio-frequency one. The static one is realized by detuning the length difference from the $\pi$ condition by means of phase shifters, the radio-frequency field by modulating the length difference of another pair of bonds by means of diodes with frequencies up to 125 MHz. Features well-known from magnetic resonance such as the transition from the laboratory to the rotating frame, and Lorentzian shaped resonance curves can thus be realized.</description>

      <title>Material elasticity determines scaling behaviour of cracking dynamics in porous materials: A precursor to crack percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While cracking is a complex dynamics that involves material intrinsic properties like grain shape and size distribution, elastic properties of grain and cementing materials, and extrinsic properties of loading, in this work, the focus has been to check the dependence on the elastic properties of the bonding material. A 3-dimensional disordered system was constructed from spherical balls of varying radii that were chosen randomly from a log-normal distribution. The growth of micro-cracks with increasing compressive strain was monitored till the limit of the percolation crack. The two parameters varied were the bond stiffness constant and the bond strength of the material. Two distinct regimes of cracking rates were observed across a critical strain $\epsilon_{knee}$ that manifested as a knee in the cumulative crack-strain plot. The critical strain $\epsilon_{knee}$ and the strain at the percolation point $\epsilon_{perc}$ showed a power law dependence on the elastic property of the bond material. Individual micro-cracks were observed to grow sharply to a maximum value $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$, after which the number of new micro-cracks decreased, showing a long tail. The maximum $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ was found to correspond to the strain $\epsilon_{knee}$, thus indicating that pre-$N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ cracking brittle, followed by ductile cracking behaviour of system. Lastly, we show that there exists a robust relation between $\epsilon_{knee}$ and $\epsilon_{perc}$ that is a power-law where the exponent is a function of the material elastic property. As $\epsilon_{knee}$ can be determined from acoustic signals associated with micro-cracks, our proposed relation can act as a warning towards critical strain resulting in crack percolation.</description>

      <title>On the Melnikov method for fractional-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to clarifying and introducing the correct application of Melnikov method in fractional dynamics. Attention to the complex dynamics of hyperbolic orbits and to fractional calculus can be, respectively, traced back to Poincar\'es attack on the three-body problem a century ago and to the early days of calculus three centuries ago. Nowadays, fractional calculus has been widely applied in modeling dynamic problems across various fields due to its advantages in describing problems with non-locality. Some of these models have also been confirmed to exhibit hyperbolic orbit dynamics, and recently, they have been extensively studied based on Melnikov method, an analytical approach for homoclinic and heteroclinic orbit dynamics. Despite its decade-long application in fractional dynamics, there is a universal problem in these applications that remains to be clarified, i.e., defining fractional-order systems within finite memory boundaries leads to the neglect of perturbation calculation for parts of the stable and unstable manifolds in Melnikov analysis. After clarifying and redefining the problem, a rigorous analytical case is provided for reference. Unlike existing results, the Melnikov criterion here is derived in a globally closed form, which was previously considered unobtainable due to difficulties in the analysis of fractional-order perturbations characterized by convolution integrals with power-law type singular kernels. Finally, numerical methods are employed to verify the derived Melnikov criterion. Overall, the clarification for the problem and the presented case are expected to provide insights for future research in this topic.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of granules-beam coupled vibration: Route and threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although granular materials are the second most processed in industry after water, the theoretical study of granules-structure interactions is not as advanced as that of fluid-structure interactions due to the lack of a unified view of the constitutive relation of granular materials. In the previous work, the theoretical model of granules-beam coupled vibration was developed and verified by experiments. However, it was also found that the system exhibits significant stiffness-softening Duffing characteristics even under micro-vibration, which implies that chaotic responses may be reached under certain conditions. To reveal the route and critical conditions for the system to enter chaos, in the present work, the chaotic dynamics of the system are studied. In qualitative analysis, Melnikov method is applied to analyze the instability behavior of the perturbed heteroclinic orbit of the system, thus the critical condition for the system to enter Smale horseshoe chaos, i.e., the Melnikov criterion, is obtained. The validity of the criterion is verified numerically. In experimental studies, the existence of chaotic responses and the route to chaos for granules-beam coupled vibrations is revealed. The experimental results suggest that the system response first experiences symmetry-breaking then undergoes a complete period-doubling cascade, and finally enters single-scroll chaos. In addition, although the Additional Dynamic Load (ADL) generated by granular media is highly complicated, a general and simple evolution pattern of the chaos threshold is found by parametric experiments, which is also supported by the Melnikov criterion. In short, the chaotic dynamics of granules-beam coupled vibration is revealed, which is a contribution to the engineering vibration aspect. On the theoretical side, an impressive result lies in that for the first time, the Melnikov criterion of such fractional-order...</description>

      <title>Acceleration deforms exponential decays into power laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exponentially decaying accelerated system looks as if its decay was of a generalized power-law type, provided relativistic time dilation in the detector and retardation of the emitted signal are taken into account. The same mathematical formula is found in generalizations of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law in quantitative linguistics, and in dynamics of re-association of folded proteins.</description>

      <title>Careful finite element simulations of cold rolling with accurate through-thickness resolution and prediction of residual stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal rolling is a widespread and well-studied process, and many finite-element (FE) rolling simulations can be found in the scientific literature. However, these FE simulations are typically limited in their resolution of through-thickness variations. In this paper, we carefully assess the accuracy of a number of FE approaches, and find that at least 60 elements through-thickness are needed to properly resolve through-thickness variation; this is significantly more than is used elsewhere in the metal rolling literature. In doing so, we reveal an oscillatory stress pattern, which is not usually observed in simulations but which we can validate by comparison with recent analytical work, and which is completely deterministic, not arising from numerical noise or error. We show that these oscillations contribute to the formation of residual stress and may help predict curvature in asymmetric rolled sheets, a phenomenon which is currently not well understood. Accurate through-thickness variation of stress and strain would also have implications for modelling microstructure evolution, damage, and surface finish.</description>
