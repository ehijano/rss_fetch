      <title>Real-time aerodynamic load estimation for hypersonics via strain-based inverse maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops an efficient real-time inverse formulation for inferring the aerodynamic surface pressures on a hypersonic vehicle from sparse measurements of the structural strain. The approach aims to provide real-time estimates of the aerodynamic loads acting on the vehicle for ground and flight testing, as well as guidance, navigation, and control applications. Specifically, the approach targets hypersonic flight conditions where direct measurement of the surface pressures is challenging due to the harsh aerothermal environment. For problems employing a linear elastic structural model, we show that the inference problem can be posed as a least-squares problem with a linear constraint arising from a finite element discretization of the governing elasticity partial differential equation. Due to the linearity of the problem, an explicit solution is given by the normal equations. Pre-computation of the resulting inverse map enables rapid evaluation of the surface pressure and corresponding integrated quantities, such as the force and moment coefficients. The inverse approach additionally allows for uncertainty quantification, providing insights for theoretical recoverability and robustness to sensor noise. Numerical studies demonstrate the estimator performance for reconstructing the surface pressure field, as well as the force and moment coefficients, for the Initial Concept 3.X (IC3X) conceptual hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Frequency Iterative Method for Reconstruction of Rough Surfaces Separating Two Penetrable Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical scheme that uses multi-frequency Newton iterations to reconstruct a rough surface profile between two dielectric media is proposed. At each frequency sample, the scheme employs Newton iterations to solve the nonlinear inverse scattering problem. At every iteration, the Newton step is computed by solving a linear system that involves the Frechet derivative of the integral operator, which represents the scattered fields, and the difference between these fields and the measurements. This linear system is regularized using the Tikhonov method. The multi-frequency data is accounted for in a recursive manner. More specifically, the profile reconstructed at a given frequency is used as an initial guess for the iterations at the next frequency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical examples, which demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct surface profiles even in the presence of measurement noise. The results also show the superiority of the multi-frequency approach over single-frequency reconstructions, particularly in terms of handling surfaces with sharp variations.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Stiff Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stability analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) coupled with random projections, for the numerical solution of (stiff) linear differential equations. For our analysis, we consider systems of linear ODEs, and linear parabolic PDEs. We prove that properly designed PINNs offer consistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent schemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation random projection PINNs guarantee asymptotic stability for very high stiffness and that single-collocation PINNs are $A$-stable. To assess the performance of the PINNs in terms of both numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, we compare it with other implicit schemes and in particular backward Euler, the midpoint, trapezoidal (Crank-Nikolson), the 2-stage Gauss scheme and the 2 and 3 stages Radau schemes. We show that the proposed PINNs outperform the above traditional schemes, in both numerical approximation accuracy and importantly computational cost, for a wide range of step sizes.</description>

      <title>Finite element discretization of the steady, generalized Navier-Stokes equations for small shear stress exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite element (FE) discretization for the steady, incompressible, fully inhomogeneous, generalized Navier-Stokes equations is proposed. By the method of divergence reconstruction operators, the formulation is valid for all shear stress exponents $p &gt; \tfrac{2d}{d+2}$. The Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed strongly, using any discretization of the boundary data which converges at a sufficient rate. $\textit{A priori}$ error estimates for velocity vector field and kinematic pressure are derived and numerical experiments are conducted. These confirm the quasi-optimality of the $\textit{a priori}$ error estimate for the velocity vector field. The $\textit{a priori}$ error estimates for the kinematic pressure are quasi-optimal if $p \leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Vertex characterization via second-order topological derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying vertex characteristics in 2D images using topological asymptotic analysis. Vertex characteristics include both the location and the type of the vertex, with the latter defined by the number of lines forming it and the corresponding angles. This problem is crucial for computer vision tasks, such as distinguishing between fore- and background objects in 3D scenes. We compute the second-order topological derivative of a Mumford-Shah type functional with respect to inclusion shapes representing various vertex types. This derivative assigns a likelihood to each pixel that a particular vertex type appears there. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimators for fourth order elliptic problems with concentrated loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two residual-based a posteriori error estimators for the $C^0$ interior penalty method in solving the biharmonic equation in a polygonal domain under a concentrated load. The first estimator is derived directly from the model equation without any post-processing technique. We rigorously prove the efficiency and reliability of the estimator by constructing bubble functions. Additionally, we extend this type of estimator to general fourth-order elliptic equations with various boundary conditions. The second estimator is based on projecting the Dirac delta function onto the discrete finite element space, allowing the application of a standard estimator. Notably, we additionally incorporate the projection error into the standard estimator. The efficiency and reliability of the estimator are also verified through rigorous analysis. We validate the performance of these a posteriori estimates within an adaptive algorithm and demonstrate their robustness and expected accuracy through extensive numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Two-stage model reduction approaches for the efficient and certified solution of parametrized optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we develop an efficient reduced order model for solving parametrized linear-quadratic optimal control problems with linear time-varying state system. The fully reduced model combines reduced basis approximations of the system dynamics and of the manifold of optimal final time adjoint states to achieve a computational complexity independent of the original state space. Such a combination is particularly beneficial in the case where a deviation in a low-dimensional output is penalized. In addition, an offline-online decomposed a posteriori error estimator bounding the error between the approximate final time adjoint with respect to the optimal one is derived and its reliability proven. We propose different strategies for building the involved reduced order models, for instance by separate reduction of the dynamical systems and the final time adjoint states or via greedy procedures yielding a combined and fully reduced model. These algorithms are evaluated and compared for a two-dimensional heat equation problem. The numerical results show the desired accuracy of the reduced models and highlight the speedup obtained by the newly combined reduced order model in comparison to an exact computation of the optimal control or other reduction approaches.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few years have seen an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. We first review previous work, in which we formulated the equations and spatial discretization for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics. We then present novel methods for nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric replusion. In the former case, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. We demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Approach to Reaction Coordinate Evaluation and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems that capture their long-term dynamics. In this work, we focus on the criteria of lumpability and decomposability, previously established for assessing RCs, and propose a new flow matching approach for the analysis and optimization of reaction coordinates based on these criteria. This method effectively utilizes data to quantitatively determine whether a given RC satisfies these criteria and enables end-to-end optimization of the reaction coordinate mapping model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the loss function used in our approach and the operator error induced by dimension reduction.</description>

      <title>Continuum Damage Model for Hydrogen Embrittlement in Ferritic Steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement of metals and alloys, particularly steels, has been an important scientific and engineering challenge in the Oil and Gas industry for many years. It impacts the integrity and performance of a wide range of structures and equipment such as downhole tubulars and pipelines in sour service in the Upstream (U/S) and hydro-processing reactors in the Downstream (D/S). In addition, the rapidly growing interest in hydrogen as an energy carrier for fuel cells and mobility or as a clean fuel/heat source for hard to decarbonize industrial processes, draws attention to this key challenge of materials integrity in handling hydrogen. The fundamental understanding of failure mechanism(s) and the capability to model material behavior is important for managing the integrity and for repurposing existing infrastructure for transporting hydrogen as well as for extending the life of structures. To that extent, the present work develops a robust mathematical model to estimate the strength degradation and embrittlement due to hydrogen in steels. The model incorporates hydrogen affected constitutive response of material, within the framework of finite element method. The modified constitutive response is a Gurson plasticity based continuum damage model and incorporates two vital aspects of NVC failure theory. These key aspects are (i) hydrogen enhanced localized dislocation plasticity, and (ii) hydrogen enhanced vacancy stabilization forming nano-voids. The deformation and damage in the material is coupled with trap mediated hydrogen diffusion. Calibration of damage model parameters is performed for X65 commercial linepipe steel. Finally, capability of the damage model is demonstrated with numerical simulation of round bar tensile tests on X65 steel under hydrogen exposure. The numerical simulations are shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated biological transportation structures with general entropy dissipation: 2D case and leaf-shaped domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the study of biological transportation networks has attracted significant interest, focusing on their self-regulating, demand-driven nature. This paper examines a mathematical model for these networks, featuring nonlinear elliptic equations for pressure and an auxiliary variable, and a reaction-diffusion parabolic equation for the conductivity tensor, introduced in \cite{portaro2022emergence}. The model, based on an energy functional with diffusive and metabolic terms, allows for various entropy generating functions, facilitating its application to different biological scenarios. We proved a local well-posedness result for the problem in H\"older spaces employing Schauder and semigroup theory. Then, after a suitable parameter reduction through scaling, we computed the numerical solution for the proposed system using a recently developed ghost nodal finite element method \cite{astuto2024nodal}. An interesting aspect emerges when the solution is very articulated and the branches occupy a wide region of the domain.</description>

      <title>About the first eigenvector of the simple random walk killed upon exiting a large bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a discrete version of a Dirichlet problem in an open bounded set $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, killed upon exiting the large (bounded) domain $D_N :=(ND)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$ -- one of our motivation is that the random walk ``conditioned to stay in $D_N$'' is a random walk among conductances $c_N(x,y) = \phi_N(x)\phi_N(y)$. With probabilistic arguments and under mild assumptions on the domain, we show that $\phi_N$ varies regularly, with a uniform control inside $D_N$. We derive several corollaries, among which a uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to the first eigenfunction of the corresponding continuous Dirichlet problem. Our results may not be new, but our proofs use (simple) probabilistic ideas that could be helpful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Error Guarantees for Least Squares Approximation with Noisy Samples in Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $n$ samples of a function $f\colon D\to\mathbb C$ in random points drawn with respect to a measure $\varrho_S$ we develop theoretical analysis of the $L_2(D, \varrho_T)$-approximation error. For a parituclar choice of $\varrho_S$ depending on $\varrho_T$, it is known that the weighted least squares method from finite dimensional function spaces $V_m$, $\dim(V_m) = m &lt; \infty$ has the same error as the best approximation in $V_m$ up to a multiplicative constant when given exact samples with logarithmic oversampling. If the source measure $\varrho_S$ and the target measure $\varrho_T$ differ we are in the domain adaptation setting, a subfield of transfer learning. We model the resulting deterioration of the error in our bounds. Further, for noisy samples, our bounds describe the bias-variance trade off depending on the dimension $m$ of the approximation space $V_m$. All results hold with high probability. For demonstration, we consider functions defined on the $d$-dimensional cube given in unifom random samples. We analyze polynomials, the half-period cosine, and a bounded orthonormal basis of the non-periodic Sobolev space $H_{\mathrm{mix}}^2$. Overcoming numerical issues of this $H_{\text{mix}}^2$ basis, this gives a novel stable approximation method with quadratic error decay. Numerical experiments indicate the applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Stable iterative refinement algorithms for solving linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative refinement (IR) is a popular scheme for solving a linear system of equations based on gradually improving the accuracy of an initial approximation. Originally developed to improve upon the accuracy of Gaussian elimination, interest in IR has been revived because of its suitability for execution on fast low-precision hardware such as analog devices and graphics processing units. IR generally converges when the error associated with the solution method is small, but is known to diverge when this error is large. We propose and analyze a novel enhancement to the IR algorithm by adding a line search optimization step that guarantees the algorithm will not diverge. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>On optimality conditions for multivariate Chebyshev approximation and convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review state-of-the-art optimality conditions of multivariate Chebyshev approximation, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. These conditions are then re-interpreted using the optimality conditions of convex optimization, subdifferential and directional derivative. Finally, this new point of view is used to derive new optimality conditions for the following problems: First for the multivariate Chebyshev approximation with a weight function. Second, the approximation problem proposed by Arzelier, Br ehard and Joldes (26th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic 2019) consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the first order approximation of the worst case evaluation error of the polynomial in Horner form.</description>

      <title>A New Matrix Truncation Method for Improving Approximate Factorisation Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this experimental work, we present a general framework based on the Bregman log determinant divergence for preconditioning Hermitian positive definite linear systems. We explore this divergence as a measure of discrepancy between a preconditioner and a matrix. Given an approximate factorisation of a given matrix, the proposed framework informs the construction of a low-rank approximation of the typically indefinite factorisation error. The resulting preconditioner is therefore a sum of a Hermitian positive definite matrix given by an approximate factorisation plus a low-rank matrix. Notably, the low-rank term is not generally obtained as a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD). This framework leads to a new truncation where principal directions are not based on the magnitude of the singular values, and we prove that such truncations are minimisers of the aforementioned divergence. We present several numerical examples showing that the proposed preconditioner can reduce the number of PCG iterations compared to a preconditioner constructed using a TSVD for the same rank. We also propose a heuristic to approximate the proposed preconditioner in the case where exact truncations cannot be computed explicitly (e.g. in a large-scale setting) and demonstrate its effectiveness over TSVD-based approaches.</description>

      <title>lymph: discontinuous poLYtopal methods for Multi-PHysics differential problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the library lymph for the finite element numerical discretization of coupled multi-physics problems. lymph is a Matlab library for the discretization of partial differential equations based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids (PolyDG) for spatial discretization coupled with suitable finite-difference time marching schemes. The objective of the paper is to introduce the library by describing it in terms of installation, input/output data, and code structure, highlighting - when necessary - key implementation aspects related to the method. A user guide, proceeding step-by-step in the implementation and solution of a Poisson problem, is also provided. In the last part of the paper, we show the results obtained for several differential problems, namely the Poisson problem, the heat equation, the elastodynamics system, and a multiphysics problem coupling poroelasticity and acoustic equations. Through these examples, we show the convergence properties and highlight some of the main features of the proposed method, i.e. geometric flexibility, high-order accuracy, and robustness with respect to heterogeneous physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of two dimensional scalar conservation laws using compact implicit numerical schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical solution of conservation laws in the two dimensional case using a novel compact implicit time discretization that enable applications of fast algebraic solvers. We present details for the second order accurate parametric scheme based on the finite volume method including simple variants of ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) approximations. We present numerical experiments for representative linear and nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>A comparison of different approaches to compute surface tension contribution in incompressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Aided Construction of Multivariate Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with an extension of univariate Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to the multivariate setting, where one chases best approximants to specific monomials by polynomials of lower degree relative to the uniform norm. Exploiting the Moment-SOS hierarchy, we devise a versatile semidefinite-programming-based procedure to compute such best approximants, as well as associated signatures. Applying this procedure in three variables leads to the values of best approximation errors for all mononials up to degree six on the euclidean ball, the simplex, and the cross-polytope. Furthermore, inspired by numerical experiments, we obtain explicit expressions for Chebyshev polynomials in two cases unresolved before, namely for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3$ on the euclidean ball and for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2 x_3$ on the simplex.</description>
