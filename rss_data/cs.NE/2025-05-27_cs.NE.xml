      <title>Multi-Objective Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is an emerging field that focuses on finding a set of behaviorally diverse and high-quality solutions. While the quality is typically defined w.r.t. a single objective function, recent work on Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD) extends QD optimization to simultaneously optimize multiple objective functions. This opens up multi-objective applications for QD, such as generating a diverse set of game maps that maximize difficulty, realism, or other properties. Existing MOQD algorithms use non-adaptive methods such as mutation and crossover to search for non-dominated solutions and construct an archive of Pareto Sets (PS). However, recent work in QD has demonstrated enhanced performance through the use of covariance-based evolution strategies for adaptive solution search. We propose bringing this insight into the MOQD problem, and introduce MO-CMA-MAE, a new MOQD algorithm that leverages Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES) to optimize the hypervolume associated with every PS within the archive. We test MO-CMA-MAE on three MOQD domains, and for generating maps of a co-operative video game, showing significant improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Wave-wind System Power Optimisation Using Effective Ensemble Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating hybrid wind-wave systems combine offshore wind platforms with wave energy converters (WECs) to create cost-effective and reliable energy solutions. Adequately designed and tuned WECs are essential to avoid unwanted loads disrupting turbine motion while efficiently harvesting wave energy. These systems diversify energy sources, enhancing energy security and reducing supply risks while providing a more consistent power output by smoothing energy production variability. However, optimising such systems is complex due to the physical and hydrodynamic interactions between components, resulting in a challenging optimisation space. This study uses a 5-MW OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platform with three spherical WECs to explore these synergies. To address these challenges, we propose an effective ensemble optimisation (EEA) technique that combines covariance matrix adaptation, novelty search, and discretisation techniques. To evaluate the EEA performance, we used four sea sites located along Australia's southern coast. In this framework, geometry and power take-off parameters are simultaneously optimised to maximise the average power output of the hybrid wind-wave system. Ensemble optimisation methods enhance performance, flexibility, and robustness by identifying the best algorithm or combination of algorithms for a given problem, addressing issues like premature convergence, stagnation, and poor search space exploration. The EEA was benchmarked against 14 advanced optimisation methods, demonstrating superior solution quality and convergence rates. EEA improved total power output by 111%, 95%, and 52% compared to WOA, EO, and AHA, respectively. Additionally, in comparisons with advanced methods, LSHADE, SaNSDE, and SLPSO, EEA achieved absorbed power enhancements of 498%, 638%, and 349% at the Sydney sea site, showcasing its effectiveness in optimising hybrid energy systems.</description>

      <title>Fully Spiking Neural Networks for Unified Frame-Event Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>LLaMEA-BO: A Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Generating Bayesian Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of algorithms for optimizing expensive black-box functions, but designing effective BO algorithms remains a manual, expertise-driven task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework). This work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as algorithmic co-designers, offering a new paradigm for automating BO development and accelerating the discovery of novel algorithmic combinations.

      <title>A Universal Flexible Neuromorphic Tactile System with Multithreshold Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely increased unstructured data brought by the large-scale intelligent sensing devices application have big challenges not only in data storing and processing but also power consumption surging. Therefore, to improve energy efficiency and processing speed, a new generation system structure and construction strategy is necessary. Most biological nervous systems, especially the tactile system, have a good flexibility and data processing performance with low power usage. Inspired from this mechanism, to optimize the intelligent system, we report a universal fully flexible neuromorphic perception system with a strong compatibility and multi-threshold signal processing strategy by mimicking tactile nervous system. Peak signal accumulated from spike encoded sensor signal in front-end processing unit can be used for recognition task directly since the bionic synaptic plasticity. Compared with conventional systems, power consumption of our system significantly decreases about 1 order of magnitude in a same recognition task. What is more, the design of voltage-based matching circuit and multithreshold processing circuit provide an excellent compatibility and multi-signal processing capability in our system. In feasibility verification, our system can output trend of different input signals (continuous signal and frequency signal etc.) accurately and have a high recognition accuracy of 90% in the symbol pattern and 90% in Morse code. These properties of our neuromorphic system show a great application potential in intelligent devices and bionic robots.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem Involving Reconfigurable Machine Tools Under Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Industry 5.0 has introduced new demands for manufacturing companies, requiring a shift in how production schedules are managed to address human centered, environmental, and economic goals comprehensively. The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), which involves processing operations on various capable machines, accurately reflects the complexities of modern manufacturing settings. This paper investigates the FJSSP involving reconfigurable machine tools with configuration dependent setup times, while integrating human aspects like worker assignments, moving time, and rest periods, as well as minimizing total energy consumption. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize these objectives. The model determines the assignment of operations to machines, workers, and configurations while sequencing operations, scheduling worker movements, and respecting rest periods, and minimizing overall energy consumption. Given the NPhard nature of the FJSSP with worker assignments and reconfigurable tools, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. This metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm features a three layer chromosome encoding method, specialized crossover and mutation strategies, and neighborhood search mechanisms to enhance solution quality and diversity. Comparisons of MA with MIP and genetic algorithms (GA) on benchmark instances demonstrate the MA efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for larger problem instances where MIP becomes impractical. This research paves the way for sustainable and resilient production schedules tailored for the factory of the future under the Industry 5.0 paradigm. The work bridges a crucial gap in current literature by integrating worker and environmental impact into the FJSSP with reconfigurable machine models.</description>

      <title>Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance.To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and effective.Extensive tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-free Spiking Neural Networks with the Forward-Forward Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm that emulates neuronal activity through discrete spike-based processing. Despite their advantages, training SNNs with traditional backpropagation (BP) remains challenging due to computational inefficiencies and a lack of biological plausibility. This study explores the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as an alternative learning framework for SNNs. Unlike backpropagation, which relies on forward and backward passes, the FF algorithm employs two forward passes, enabling layer-wise localized learning, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. We introduce an FF-based SNN training framework and evaluate its performance across both non-spiking (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST) and spiking (Neuro-MNIST, SHD) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing FF-based SNNs on evaluated static datasets with a much lighter architecture while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art backpropagation-trained SNNs. On more complex spiking tasks such as SHD, our approach outperforms other SNN models and remains competitive with leading backpropagation-trained SNNs. These findings highlight the FF algorithm's potential to advance SNN training methodologies by addressing some key limitations of backpropagation.</description>

      <title>Interlocking-free Selective Rationalization Through Genetic-based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</description>
