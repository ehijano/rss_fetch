      <title>New techniques to investigate the AGN-SF connection with integral field spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei and star-formation (the AGN-SF connection) is one of the longest standing problems in modern astrophysics. In the age of large Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys, studies of the AGN-SF connection greatly benefit from spatially resolving AGN and SF contributions to study the two processes independently. Using IFU data for 54 local active galaxies from the S7 sample, we present a new method to separate emission from AGN activity and SF using mixing sequences observed in the [NII]$\lambda 6584$/H$\alpha$ vs. [OIII]$\lambda 5007$/H$\beta$ Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We use the new decomposition method to calculate the H$\alpha$ star-formation rate and AGN [OIII] luminosity for the galaxies. Our new method is robust to outliers in the line-ratio distribution and can be applied to large galaxy samples with little manual intervention. We infer star-formation histories (SFHs) using pPXF, conducting detailed recovery tests to determine the quantities that can be considered robust. We test the correlation between the AGN Eddington ratio, using the proxy L[OIII]/$\sigma_*^4$, and star-formation properties. We find a moderately strong correlation between the Eddington ratio and the star-formation rate (SFR). We also observe marginally significant correlations between the AGN Eddington ratio and the light-weighted stellar age under 100 Myr. Our results point to higher AGN accretion being associated with young nuclear star formation under 100 Myr, consistent with timelines presented in previous studies. The correlations found in this paper are relatively weak; extending our methods to larger samples, including radio-quiet galaxies, will help better constrain the physical mechanisms and timescales of the AGN-SF connection.</description>

      <title>Single Pixel Imaging and Compressive Sensing: A Practical Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Pixel Imaging is an emerging imaging technique that employs a bucket detector (photodiode) to sample a spatially modulated light field, rather than measuring the spatial distribution with an array of detectors. This approach provides a low-cost alternative for imaging at unconventional wavelengths and enables improved signal collection in noisy measurement environments. Furthermore, it allows the application of compressive sensing to reduce the amount of acquired data and measurement time, facilitating live or in vivo imaging applications. This tutorial presents the experimental implementation of measurement bases and compressive sensing reconstruction methods, including both deterministic algorithms and deep learning approaches. Accompanying Python notebooks guide readers through the reproduction of the presented results and support the application of the methods to their own work.</description>

      <title>Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description>

      <title>A Wide-Sense Stationarity Test Based on the Geometric Structure of Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a test for wide-sense stationarity (WSS) based on the geometry of the covariance function. We estimate local patches of the covariance surface and then check whether the directional derivative in the $(1,1,0)$ direction is zero on each patch. The method only requires the covariance function to be locally smooth and does not assume stationarity in advance. It can be applied to general stochastic dynamical systems and provides a time-resolved view. We apply the test method to an SDOF system and to a stochastic Duffing oscillator. These examples show that the method is numerically stable and can detect departures from WSS in practice.</description>

      <title>It's Not The Plane -- It's The Pilot: A Framework for Cognitive-Activated AI-Augmentation to Avoid the Boiling Frog Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can now reliably solve many standard tasks used in introductory physics courses, producing correct equations, graphs, and explanations. While this capability is often framed as an opportunity for efficiency or personalization, it also poses a subtle ethical and educational risk: students may increasingly submit correct results without engaging in the epistemic practices that define learning physics. This challenge has recently been described as the "boiling frog problem" because we may not fully recognize how rapidly AI capabilities are advancing and fail to respond with commensurate urgency. In this article, we argue that the central challenge of AI in physics education is not cheating or tool selection, but instructional design. Drawing on research on self-regulated learning, cognitive load, multiple representations, and hybrid intelligence, we propose a practical framework for cognitively activated learning activities that structures student activities before, during, and after AI use. Using an example from an introductory kinematics laboratory, we show how AI can be integrated in ways that preserve prediction, interpretation, and evaluation as core learning activities. Rather than treating AI as an answer-generating tool, the framework positions AI as an epistemic partner whose contributions are deliberately bounded and reflected upon.</description>
