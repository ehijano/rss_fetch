      <title>Scenario-free robust optimization algorithm for IMRT and IMPT treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust treatment planning algorithms for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) allow for uncertainty reduction in the delivered dose distributions through explicit inclusion of error scenarios. Due to the curse of dimensionality, application of such algorithms can easily become computationally prohibitive. This work proposes a scenario-free probabilistic robust optimization algorithm that overcomes both the runtime and memory limitations typical of traditional robustness algorithms. The scenario-free approach minimizes cost-functions evaluated on expected-dose distributions and total variance. Calculation of these quantities relies on precomputed expected-dose-influence and total-variance-influence matrices, such that no scenarios need to be stored for optimization. The algorithm was developed within matRad and tested in several optimization configurations for photon and proton irradiation plans. A traditional robust optimization algorithm and a margin-based approach are used as a reference to benchmark the performances of the scenario-free algorithm in terms of plan quality, robustness and computational workload. The scenario-free approach achieves plan quality compatible with traditional robust optimization algorithms and it reduces the standard deviation within selected structures when variance reduction objectives are defined. Avoiding the storage of individual scenario information allows for the inclusion of an arbitrary number of error scenarios. The observed optimization time is independent on the number of included scenarios, compatible with a nominal, non-robust algorithm and significantly lower than the traditional robust approach. These properties make the scenario-free approach suitable for the optimization of robust plans involving a high number of error scenarios and CT phases as 4D robust optimization.</description>

      <title>B1+ mapping near metallic implants using turbo spin echo pulse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a B1+ mapping technique for imaging of body parts containing metal hardware, based on magnitude images acquired with turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences. Theory and Methods: To encode the underlying B1+, multiple (two to four) TSE image sets with various excitation and refocusing flip angles were acquired. To this end, the acquired signal intensities were matched to a database of simulated signals which was generated by solving the Bloch equations taking into account the exact sequence parameters. The retrieved B1+ values were validated against gradient-recalled and spin echo dual angle methods, as well as a vendor-provided turboFLASH-based mapping sequence, in gel phantoms and human subjects without and with metal implants. Results: In the absence of metal, phantom experiments demonstrated excellent agreement between the proposed technique using three or four flip angle sets and reference dual angle methods. In human subjects without metal implants, the proposed technique with three or four flip angle sets showed excellent correlation with the spin echo dual angle method. In the presence of metal, both phantoms and human subjects revealed a narrow range of B1+ estimation with the reference techniques, whereas the proposed technique successfully resolved B1+ near the metal. In select cases, the technique was implemented in conjunction with multispectral metal artifact reduction sequences and successfully applied for B1+ shimming. Conclusion: The proposed technique enables resolution of B1+ values in regions near metal hardware, overcoming susceptibility-related and narrow-range limitations of standard mapping techniques.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the surface paradox: Buried perovskite quantum dots in wide-bandgap perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dynamical Low-rank Approach for Charged Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.
  For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a formidable technique for non-invasively characterizing brain microstructure. Biophysical modelling is often necessary to gain specificity to cellular structure. However, designing sensible biophysical models and appropriate dMRI acquisitions is challenging, especially for gray matter (GM), as little is known about typical values of relevant features of braincell morphology contributing to dMRI signal.
  This work addressees this unmet need. We analysed about 3,500 cells from mouse, rat, monkey and human brains to determine statistical distributions of a set of morphological features (structural, topological and shape descriptors) relevant to GM microstructure modelling. Illustrative examples demonstrate how this study can inform biophysical modelling and important implications for biophysical modelling of GM are discussed, enabling the design of more sensible models and suitable data acquisitions.</description>
