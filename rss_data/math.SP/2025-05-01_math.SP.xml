      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Lorentzian quasi-Fuchsian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional quasi-Fuchsian Lorentzian manifold $M$ is a globally hyperbolic spacetime diffeomorphic to $\Sigma\times (-1,1)$ for a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$ of genus $\geq 2$. It is the quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash \Omega_\Gamma$ of an open set $\Omega_\Gamma\subset {\rm AdS}_3$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$ of isometries of ${\rm AdS}_3$ which is a particular example of an Anosov representation of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$. We first show that the spacelike geodesic flow of $M$ is Axiom A, has a discrete Ruelle resonance spectrum with associated (co-)resonant states, and that the Poincar\'e series for $\Gamma$ extend meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$. This is then used to prove that there is a natural notion of resolvent of the pseudo-Riemannian Laplacian $\Box$ of $M$, which is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ with poles of finite rank, defining a notion of quantum resonances and quantum resonant states related to the Ruelle resonances and (co-)resonant states by a quantum-classical correspondence. This initiates the spectral study of convex co-compact pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Prescription of the Robin spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of prescribing the finite Robin spectrum. Let $M$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with smooth boundary, and let $\rho \in C_+(\partial M)$ be a positive continuous Robin parameter on the boundary. This paper addresses the spectral prescribing problem for Robin eigenvalues under two geometric constraints. First, we establish that for any finite sequence of positive numbers and any prescribed volume, there exists a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ whose Robin spectrum (with parameter $\rho$) begins with the given sequence. Subsequently, we restrict to metrics within a fixed conformal class. While exact spectral prescription becomes impossible in this constrained setting, we prove that the multiplicities of finitely many Robin eigenvalues can be arbitrarily assigned (when $\dim M \ge 3$). A pivotal step of our approach involves solving the analogous Dirichlet eigenvalue multiplicity problem in conformal classes. Consequently, we obtain as an intermediate result the prescription of Dirichlet eigenvalue multiplicities within given conformal classes.</description>

      <title>Pointwise dispersive estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pointwise decay estimates for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations on a product cone $(X,g)$, where the metric $g=dr^2+r^2 h$ and $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)\times Y$ is a product cone over the closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ with metric $h$. Under the assumption that the conjugate radius $\epsilon$ of $Y$ satisfies $\epsilon&gt;\pi$, we prove the pointwise dispersive estimates for the Schr\"odinger and half-wave propagator in this setting. The key ingredient is the modified Hadamard parametrix on $Y$ in which the role of the conjugate points does not come to play if $\epsilon&gt;\pi$. In a work in progress, we will further study the case that $\epsilon\leq\pi$ in which the role of conjugate points come. A new finding is that a threshold of the conjugate radius of $Y$ for $L^p$-estimates in this setting is the magical number $\pi$.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for symmetric hyperbolic Partial Differential Operators on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a complete Riemannian manifold, as well as time independent smooth lower order terms appearing in a first order symmetric perturbation of a Riemannian wave operator can be uniquely recovered, up to the natural obstructions, from a local source to solution map of the respective hyperbolic initial value problem. Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical Boundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and Kurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric problem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the manifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to any point in a fixed \textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is well known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this paper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further adaptation of the BC-method.</description>
