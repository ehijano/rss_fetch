      <title>Chasing Tails: How Do People Respond to Wait Time Distributions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a series of pre-registered, incentive-compatible online experiments to investigate how people evaluate and choose among different waiting time distributions. Our main findings are threefold. First, consistent with prior literature, people show an aversion to both longer expected waits and higher variance. Second, and more surprisingly, moment-based utility models fail to capture preferences when distributions have thick-right tails: indeed, decision-makers strongly prefer distributions with long-right tails (where probability mass is more evenly distributed over a larger support set) relative to tails that exhibit a spike near the maximum possible value, even when controlling for mean, variance, and higher moments. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) utility models commonly used in portfolio theory predict these choices well. Third, when given a choice, decision-makers overwhelmingly seek information about right-tail outcomes. These results have practical implications for service operations: (1) service designs that create a spike in long waiting times (such as priority or dedicated queue designs) may be particularly aversive; (2) when informativeness is the goal, providers should prioritize sharing right-tail probabilities or percentiles; and (3) to increase service uptake, providers can strategically disclose (or withhold) distributional information depending on right-tail shape.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Distance: Cognitive Traversal Distance as a Holistic Measure of Scientific Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific novelty is a critical construct in bibliometrics and is commonly measured by aggregating pairwise distances between the knowledge units underlying a paper. While prior work has refined how such distances are computed, less attention has been paid to how dyadic relations are aggregated to characterize novelty at the paper level. We address this limitation by introducing a network-based indicator, Cognitive Traversal Distance (CTD). Conceptualizing the historical literature as a weighted knowledge network, CTD is defined as the length of the shortest path required to connect all knowledge units associated with a paper. CTD provides a paper-level novelty measure that reflects the minimal structural distance needed to integrate multiple knowledge units, moving beyond mean- or quantile-based aggregation of pairwise distances. Using 27 million biomedical publications indexed by OpenAlex and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) as standardized knowledge units, we evaluate CTD against expert-based novelty benchmarks from F1000Prime-recommended papers and Nobel Prize-winning publications. CTD consistently outperforms conventional aggregation-based indicators. We further show that MeSH-based CTD is less sensitive to novelty driven by the emergence of entirely new conceptual labels, clarifying its scope relative to recent text-based measures.</description>

      <title>Value-transforming financial, carbon and biodiversity footprint accounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformative changes in our production and consumption habits are needed to halt biodiversity loss. Organizations are the way we humans have organized our everyday life, and much of our negative environmental impacts, also called carbon and biodiversity footprints, are caused by organizations. Here we explore how the accounts of any organization can be exploited to develop an integrated carbon and biodiversity footprint account. As a metric we utilize spatially explicit potential global loss of species across all ecosystem types and argue that it can be understood as the biodiversity equivalent. The utility of the biodiversity equivalent for biodiversity could be like what carbon dioxide equivalent is for climate. We provide a global country specific dataset that organizations, experts and researchers can use to assess consumption-based biodiversity footprints. We also argue that the current integration of financial and environmental accounting is superficial, and provide a framework for a more robust financial value-transforming accounting model. To test the methodologies, we utilized a Finnish university as a living lab. Assigning an offsetting cost to the footprints significantly altered the financial value of the organization. We believe such value-transforming accounting is needed to draw the attention of senior executives and investors to the negative environmental impacts of their organizations.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Demand Analysis Using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advances empirical demand analysis by integrating multimodal product representations derived from artificial intelligence (AI). Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</description>

      <title>Separating Advertising and Marketplace Functions of E-commerce Platforms: Is it Social Welfare Enhancing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of sponsored product listings in prominent positions of consumer search results has made e-commerce platforms, which traditionally serve as marketplaces for third-party sellers to reach consumers, a major medium for those sellers to advertise their products. On the other hand, regulators have expressed anti-trust concerns about an e-commerce platform's integration of marketplace and advertising functions; they argue that such integration benefits the platform and sellers at the expense of consumers and society and have proposed separating the advertising function from those platforms. We show, contrary to regulators' concerns, that separating the advertising function from the e-commerce platform benefits the sellers, hurts the consumers, and does not necessarily benefit the social welfare. A key driver of our findings is that an independent advertising firm, which relies solely on advertising revenue, has same or lesser economic incentive to improve targeting precision than an e-commerce platform that also serves as the advertising medium, even if both have the same ability to target consumers. This is because an improvement in targeting precision enhances the marketplace commission by softening the price competition between sellers, but hurts the advertising revenue by softening the competition for prominent ad positions.</description>
