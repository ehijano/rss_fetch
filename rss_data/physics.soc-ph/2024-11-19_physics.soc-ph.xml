      <title>Tenure and Research Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</description>

      <title>Never eat a Pigeon with a Pumpkin: a model for the emergence and fixation of unsupported beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular poster from Myanmar lists food pairings that should be avoided, sometimes at all costs. Coconut and honey taken together, for example, are believed to cause nausea, while pork and curdled milk will induce diarrhea. Worst of all, according to the poster, many seemingly innocuous combinations that include jelly and coffee, beef and star fruit, or pigeon and pumpkin, are likely to kill the unwary consumer. But why are these innocuous combinations considered dangerous, even fatal? The answer is relevant, not just to food beliefs, but to social beliefs of many kinds. Here we describe the prevalence of food combination superstitions, and an opinion formation model simulating their emergence and fixation. We find that such food norms are influenced, not just by actual risks, but also by strong forces of cultural learning that can drive and lock in arbitrary rules, even in the face of contrary evidence.</description>

      <title>Applying Infomap-based Hierarchical Community Detection for Multi-level City On-Demand Delivery Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient management of on-demand delivery systems is essential for modern urban logistics, especially in densely populated cities with complex spatial layouts. This study introduces a novel, computer-supported cooperative framework that utilizes Infomap-based hierarchical community detection to analyze spatial multilevel clustering patterns. The experiment was conducted to large scale on-demand delivery datasets from Shenzhen and Beijing, revealing integrated spatial clusters that align with cohesive urban layout. Through hierarchical detection, finer and fragmented clusters are identified, reflecting its diverse urban structure and delivery demands. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical community detection in uncovering spatial dependencies and optimizing resource allocation and delivery strategies. This framework provides practical insights for urban logistics, enabling tailored approaches for business hub placement, route allocation, and adaptive resource management.</description>

      <title>Unraveling 20th-century political regime dynamics using the physics of diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty persists over how and why some countries become democratic and others do not, or why some countries remain democratic and others 'backslide' toward autocracy. Furthermore, while scholars generally agree on the nature of 'democracy' and 'autocracy', the nature of regimes in-between, and changes between them, are much less clear. By applying the spectral dimensionality-reduction technique Diffusion Map to political-science data from the V-Dem project for the period 1900 to 2021, we identify a low-dimensional non-linear manifold on which all electoral regimes move. Using the diffusion equation from statistical physics, we measure the time scale on which countries change their degree of electoral quality, freedom of association, and freedom of expression depending on their position on the manifold. By quantifying the coefficients of the diffusion equation for each country and over time, we show that democracies behave like sub-diffusive (i.e. slow spreading) particles and that autocracies on the verge of collapse behave like super-diffusive (i.e. fast spreading) particles. We show that regimes in-between exhibit diffusion dynamics distinct from autocracies and democracies, and an overall higher instability. Furthermore, we show that a country's position on the manifold and its dynamics are linked to its propensity for civil conflict. Our study pioneers the use of statistical physics in the analysis of political regimes. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for developing theories about what changes during democratization and democratic backsliding, as well as a new framework for regime-transformation and risk-of-conflict assessment.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous population and its resilience to misinformation in vaccination uptake: A dual ODE and network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation about vaccination poses a significant public health threat by reducing vaccination rates and increasing disease burden. Understanding population heterogeneity can aid in recognizing and mitigating the effects of such misinformation, especially when vaccine effectiveness is low. Our research quantifies the impact of misinformation on vaccination uptake and explores its effects in heterogeneous versus homogeneous populations. We employed a dual approach combining ordinary differential equations (ODE) and complex network models to analyze how different epidemiological parameters influence disease spread and vaccination behaviour. Our results indicate that misinformation significantly lowers vaccination rates, particularly in homogeneous populations, while heterogeneous populations demonstrate greater resilience. Among network topologies, small-world networks achieve higher vaccination rates under varying vaccine efficacies, while scale-free networks experience reduced vaccine coverage with higher misinformation amplification. Notably, cumulative infection remains independent of disease transmission rate when the vaccine is partially effective. In small-world networks, cumulative infection shows high stochasticity across vaccination rates and misinformation parameters, while cumulative vaccination is highest with higher and lower misinformation. To control disease spread, public health efforts should address misinformation, particularly in homogeneous populations and scale-free networks. Building resilience by promoting reliable vaccine information can boost vaccination rates. Focusing campaigns on small-world networks can result in higher vaccine uptake.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays an important role in shaping individual opinions and actions, particularly in our digitally connected world. AI-generated, personalized content has led to serious and well-founded concerns, including United States Supreme Court Cases regarding the potential for the radicalization of individuals based on social influence. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on the integrity of a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and use tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamic Structure Function (DSF)), to identify precisely the perturbations that are sufficient to qualitatively alter the system's equilibrium and also minimal in norm. In particular, we examine two scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations taking the form of the addition of a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that even small alterations to network structure may cause sentiments to grow in magnitude without bound, indicating the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by minor adjustments in social influence. Our findings emphasize the imperative need for further investigation into vulnerabilities in real-world social networks, where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>Econometrics and Formalism of Psychological Archetypes of Scientific Workers with Introverted Thinking Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chronological hierarchy and classification of psychological types of individuals are examined. The anomalous nature of psychological activity in individuals involved in scientific work is highlighted. Certain aspects of the introverted thinking type in scientific activities are analyzed. For the first time, psychological archetypes of scientists with pronounced introversion are postulated in the context of twelve hypotheses about the specifics of professional attributes of introverted scientific activities.
  A linear regression and Bayesian equation are proposed for quantitatively assessing the econometric degree of introversion in scientific employees, considering a wide range of characteristics inherent to introverts in scientific processing. Specifically, expressions for a comprehensive assessment of introversion in a linear model and the posterior probability of the econometric (scientometric) degree of introversion in a Bayesian model are formulated.
  The models are based on several econometric (scientometric) hypotheses regarding various aspects of professional activities of introverted scientists, such as a preference for solo publications, low social activity, narrow specialization, high research depth, and so forth. Empirical data and multiple linear regression methods can be used to calibrate the equations. The model can be applied to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological characteristics of scientific employees, which is particularly useful in ergonomics and the management of scientific teams and projects. The proposed method also provides scientists with pronounced introversion the opportunity to develop their careers, focusing on individual preferences and features.</description>

      <title>The epidemiological footprint of contact structures in models with two levels of mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with several levels of mixing (households, workplaces), as well as various corresponding formulations for R0, have been proposed in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the distribution of the population size within social structures, effect that can help plan effective interventions. We focus on the influence on the model outcomes of teleworking strategies, consisting in reshaping the distribution of workplace sizes. We consider a stochastic SIR model with two levels of mixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual belonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace size distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this distribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak. In particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of individuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace outperform the strategy with linear dependence. Besides, one drawback of the model with multiple levels of mixing is its complexity, raising interest in a reduced model. We propose a homogeneously mixing SIR ODE-based model, whose infection rate is chosen as to observe the growth rate of the initial model. This reduced model yields a generally satisfying approximation of the epidemic. These results, robust to various changes in model structure, are very promising from the perspective of implementing effective strategies based on social distancing of specific contacts. Furthermore, they contribute to the effort of building relevant approximations of individual based models at intermediate scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamic models of gentrification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of gentrification of an urban area is characterized by the displacement of lower-income residents due to rising living costs and an influx of wealthier individuals. This study presents an agent-based model that simulates urban gentrification through the relocation of three income groups -- low, middle, and high -- driven by living costs. The model incorporates economic and sociological theories to generate realistic neighborhood transition patterns. We introduce a temporal network-based measure to track the outflow of low-income residents and the inflow of middle- and high-income residents over time. Our experiments reveal that high-income residents trigger gentrification and that our network-based measure consistently detects gentrification patterns earlier than traditional count-based methods, potentially serving as an early detection tool in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the analysis also highlights how city density promotes gentrification. This framework offers valuable insights for understanding gentrification dynamics and informing urban planning and policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Why distinctiveness centrality is distinctive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper responds to a commentary by Neal (2024) regarding the Distinctiveness centrality metrics introduced by Fronzetti Colladon and Naldi (2020). Distinctiveness centrality offers a novel reinterpretation of degree centrality, particularly emphasizing the significance of direct connections to loosely connected peers within (social) networks. This response paper presents a more comprehensive analysis of the correlation between Distinctiveness and the Beta and Gamma measures. All five distinctiveness measures are considered, as well as a more meaningful range of the alpha parameter and different network topologies, distinguishing between weighted and unweighted networks. Findings indicate significant variability in correlations, supporting the viability of Distinctiveness as alternative or complementary metrics within social network analysis. Moreover, the paper presents computational complexity analysis and simplified R code for practical implementation. Encouraging initial findings suggest potential applications in diverse domains, inviting further exploration and comparative analyses.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Learning a Universal Trajectory Foundation Model from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</description>
