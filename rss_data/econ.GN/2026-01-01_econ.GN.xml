      <title>RepoMech: A Method to Reduce the Balance-Sheet Impact of Repo Intermediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A repo trade involves the sale of a security coupled with a contract to repurchase at a later time. Following the 2008 financial crisis, accounting standards were updated to require repo intermediaries, who are mostly banks, to increase recorded assets at the time of the first transaction. Concurrently, US bank regulators implemented a supplementary leverage ratio constraint that reduces the volume of assets a bank is allowed record. The interaction of the new accounting rules and bank regulations limits the volume of repo trades that banks can intermediate. To reduce the balance-sheet impact of repo, the SEC has mandated banks to centrally clear all Treasuries trades. This achieves multilateral netting but shifts counterparty risk onto the clearinghouse, which can distort monitoring incentives and raise trading cost through the imposition of fees. We present RepoMech, a method that avoids these pitfalls by multilaterally netting repo trades without altering counterparty risk.</description>

      <title>Optimal Carbon Prices in an Unequal World: The Role of Regional Welfare Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should nations price carbon? This paper examines how the treatment of global inequality, captured by regional welfare weights, affects optimal carbon prices. I develop theory to identify the conditions under which accounting for differences in marginal utilities of consumption across countries leads to more stringent global climate policy in the absence of international transfers. I further establish a connection between the optimal uniform carbon prices implied by different welfare weights and heterogeneous regional preferences over climate policy stringency. In calibrated simulations, I find that accounting for global inequality reduces optimal global emissions relative to an inequality-insensitive benchmark. This holds both when carbon prices are regionally differentiated, with emissions 21% lower, and when they are constrained to be globally uniform, with the uniform carbon price 15% higher.</description>

      <title>Scaling Charitable Incentives: Policy Selection, Beliefs, and Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why are interventions with weak evidence still adopted? We study charitable incentives for physical activity in Japan using three linked methods, including a randomized field experiment (N=808), a stakeholder belief survey (local government officials and private-sector employees, N=2,400), and a conjoint experiment on policy choice. Financial incentives increase daily steps by about 1,000, whereas charitable incentives deliver a precisely estimated null. Nonetheless, stakeholders greatly overpredict charitable incentives' effects on walking, participation, and prosociality. Conjoint choices show policymakers value step gains as well as other outcomes, shaping policy choice. Adoption thus reflects multidimensional beliefs and objectives, highlighting policy selection as a scaling challenge.</description>

      <title>Antecedents of Consumer Regret Frequency: The Roles of Decision Agency, Status Signaling, and Online Shopping Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumer regret is a widespread post-purchase emotion that significantly impacts satisfaction, product returns, complaint behavior, and customer loyalty. Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers' perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret..</description>

      <title>The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.</description>

      <title>Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.</description>

      <title>Optimal longevity of a dynasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard optimal growth models implicitly impose a ``perpetual existence'' constraint, which can ethically justify infinite misery in stagnant economies. This paper investigates the optimal longevity of a dynasty within a Critical-Level Utilitarian (CLU) framework. By treating the planning horizon as an endogenous choice variable, we establish a structural isomorphism between static population ethics and dynamic growth theory. Our analysis derives closed-form solutions for optimal consumption and longevity in a roundabout production economy. We show that under low productivity, a finite horizon is structurally optimal to avoid the creation of lives not worth living. This result suggests that the termination of a dynasty can be interpreted not as a failure of sustainability, but as an {altruistic termination} to prevent intergenerational suffering. We also highlight an ethical asymmetry: while a finite horizon is optimal for declining economies, growing economies under intergenerational equity demand the ultimate sacrifice from the current generation.</description>

      <title>Persistent gender attitudes and women entrepreneurship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether gender norms - proxied by the outcome of Switzerland's 1981 public referendum on constitutional gender equality - continue to shape local female startup activity today, despite substantial population changes over the past four decades. Using startup data for all Swiss municipalities from 2016 to 2023, we find that municipalities that historically expressed stronger support for gender equality have significantly higher present women-to-men startup ratios. The estimated elasticity of this ratio with respect to the share of "yes" votes in the 1981 referendum is 0.165. This finding is robust to controlling for a subsequent referendum on gender roles, a rich set of municipality-specific characteristics, and contemporary policy measures. The relationship between historical voting outcomes and current women's entrepreneurship is stronger in municipalities with greater population stability - measured by the share of residents born locally - and in municipalities where residents are less likely to report a religious affiliation. While childcare spending is not statistically related to startup rates on its own, it is positively associated with the women-to-men startup ratio when interacted with historical gender norms, consistent with both formal and informal support mechanisms jointly shaping women's entrepreneurial activity.</description>

      <title>A Unified Metric Architecture for AI Infrastructure: A Cross-Layer Taxonomy Integrating Performance, Efficiency, and Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of large-scale AI systems is increasingly constrained by infrastructure limits: power availability, thermal and water constraints, interconnect scaling, memory pressure, data-pipeline throughput, and rapidly escalating lifecycle cost. Across hyperscale clusters, these constraints interact, yet the main metrics remain fragmented. Existing metrics, ranging from facility measures (PUE) and rack power density to network metrics (all-reduce latency), data-pipeline measures, and financial metrics (TCO series), each capture only their own domain and provide no integrated view of how physical, computational, and economic constraints interact. This fragmentation obscures the structural relationships among energy, computation, and cost, preventing a coherent optimization across sector and how bottlenecks emerge, propagate, and jointly determine the efficiency frontier of AI infrastructure.
  This paper develops an integrated framework that unifies these disparate metrics through a three-domain semantic classification and a six-layer architectural decomposition, producing a 6x3 taxonomy that maps how various sectors propagate across the AI infrastructure stack. The taxonomy is grounded in a systematic review and meta-analysis of all metrics with economic and financial relevance, identifying the most widely used measures, their research intensity, and their cross-domain interdependencies. Building on this evidence base, the Metric Propagation Graph (MPG) formalizes cross-layer dependencies, enabling systemwide interpretation, composite-metric construction, and multi-objective optimization of energy, carbon, and cost.
  The framework offers a coherent foundation for benchmarking, cluster design, capacity planning, and lifecycle economic analysis by linking physical operations, computational efficiency, and cost outcomes within a unified analytic structure.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Rewards in the Era of Intelligence-Driven Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.</description>
