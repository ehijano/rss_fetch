      <title>The National Intangible Resources and their Importance in the Current Knowledge-Based Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, models for assessing national intangible resources are analysed through a lecture in the literature, and the best-known evaluation methods are categorized into academic models and models of international organizations, with the most important differences being identified. The European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) and the World Economic Forum annual reports on Global Competitiveness were considered to assess Romania's position in the international context in terms of intangible assets. Despite the importance of intangible resources at national level and the fact that they are an important factor in determining economic growth in the current knowledge-based economy, this article concludes that Romania's position in the international context regarding intangible assets is very weak, with many weak points in research and innovation performance compared to other EU Member States. Therefore, there is a need in our country to re-evaluate the areas where all efforts need to be focused to stimulate innovation performance, to properly manage national intangible resources, a crucial process for improving the quality of life.</description>

      <title>Evolution of exchange rate regime: Impact of macroeconomy of Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bangladesh has experienced two distinct exchange rate regimes: a fixed exchange rate system from January 1972 to May 2003 and a floating one since June 2003. After adopting the floating exchange rate regime, Bangladesh positively impacted macroeconomic development. The key macroeconomic variables considered include foreign reserves, worker's remittances, and export proceeds. However, ongoing challenges for the country include the depreciating trend of the local currency within a highly inflationary economy. This paper aims to evaluate macroeconomic performance across the two regimes and analyze the current currency situation in Bangladesh.</description>

      <title>Cyber Shadows: Neutralizing Security Threats with AI and Targeted Policy Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital age, driven by the AI revolution, brings significant opportunities but also conceals security threats, which we refer to as cyber shadows. These threats pose risks at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This paper examines the systemic impact of these cyber threats and proposes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that integrates AI-driven solutions, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), with targeted policy interventions. By combining technological and regulatory measures, we create a multilevel defense capable of addressing both direct threats and indirect negative externalities. We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven solutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats and mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we underscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially in response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure the creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>ADAGE: A generic two-layer framework for adaptive agent based modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable for modelling complex, potentially out-of-equilibria scenarios. However, ABMs have long suffered from the Lucas critique, stating that agent behaviour should adapt to environmental changes. Furthermore, the environment itself often adapts to these behavioural changes, creating a complex bi-level adaptation problem. Recent progress integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning into ABMs introduces adaptive agent behaviour, beginning to address the first part of this critique, however, the approaches are still relatively ad hoc, lacking a general formulation, and furthermore, do not tackle the second aspect of simultaneously adapting environmental level characteristics in addition to the agent behaviours. In this work, we develop a generic two-layer framework for ADaptive AGEnt based modelling (ADAGE) for addressing these problems. This framework formalises the bi-level problem as a Stackelberg game with conditional behavioural policies, providing a consolidated framework for adaptive agent-based modelling based on solving a coupled set of non-linear equations. We demonstrate how this generic approach encapsulates several common (previously viewed as distinct) ABM tasks, such as policy design, calibration, scenario generation, and robust behavioural learning under one unified framework. We provide example simulations on multiple complex economic and financial environments, showing the strength of the novel framework under these canonical settings, addressing long-standing critiques of traditional ABMs.</description>

      <title>Inventor Mobility After the Fall of the Berlin Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the inter-organizational and spatial mobility patterns of East German inventors following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Existing research often overlooks the role of informal institutions in the mobility decisions of inventors, particularly regarding access to and transfer of knowledge. To address this gap, we investigate the unique circumstances surrounding the dissolution of the German Democratic Republic, which caused a significant shock to establishment closures and prompted many inventors to change their jobs and locations. Our sample comprises over 25,000 East German inventors, whose patenting careers in reunified Germany post-1990 are traced using a novel disambiguation and matching procedure. Our findings reveal that East German inventors in technological fields where access to Western knowledge was facilitated by industrial espionage were more likely to pursue inter-organizational mobility and continue their inventive activities in reunified Germany. Additionally, inventors from communities with strong political support for the ruling socialist party encountered difficulties in sourcing knowledge through weak ties, resulting in a lower likelihood of continuing to patent. However, those who overcame these obstacles and continued to produce inventions were more likely to relocate to West Germany, leaving their original social contexts behind.</description>

      <title>It Takes Three to Ceilidh: Pension System and Multidimensional Poverty Mitigation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research, employing the Alkire-Foster approach to uncover multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, models and examines the sustainable effects and mechanisms of the three-pillar pension system in household poverty mitigation with the China Family Panel Studies data. The results evince that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of synchronising state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against exogenous shocks and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the theory and praxis of the facilitating state in new structural economics illustrated by the multi-pillar pension system in sustainable micro-household poverty mitigation.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities and capabilities in the EU Automotive industry: Leveraging Input-Output Analysis and Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structural vulnerabilities and competitive dynamics of the EU27 automotive sector, with a focus on the complexity and the fragmentation of production processes across global value chains. Employing a mixed-methods approach, our analysis integrates input-output tables to quantify the sector's reliance on non-EU economic branches, alongside an economic complexity framework to assess the underlying productive capabilities of European countries in automotive-related industries. The findings indicate an increasing dependency on extra-EU suppliers, particularly China, for critical components such as lithium-ion batteries, which heightens supply chain risks. Currently, Eastern European countries-most notably Poland, Czechia, and Hungary-have enhanced their competitiveness in the production of automotive components, surpassing traditional leaders such as Germany. The paper advances the literature by providing a novel, granular list of 6-digit products within the automotive supply chain and offers new insights into the challenges posed by the ongoing electric mobility transition in the European Union, particularly in relation to electric accumulators.</description>
