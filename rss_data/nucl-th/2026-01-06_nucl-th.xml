      <title>Neutron skins probed in proton knockout from neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-induced quasifree knockout reactions provide a powerful probe of nuclear single-particle structure and reaction dynamics in both stable and neutron-rich nuclei. In this work we develop a unified theoretical framework for the calculation of inclusive (p,2p) and sequential (p,3p) reaction cross sections and fragment momentum distributions at intermediate and relativistic energies. The approach is based on a probabilistic extension of Glauber multiple-scattering theory combined with microscopic nuclear densities obtained from Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme energy-density functionals. We focus in particular on the sensitivity of total cross sections and longitudinal momentum dispersions to neutron-skin thickness along isotopic chains. Our results indicate that both (p,2p) and (p,3p) reactions exhibit a systematic decrease of cross section and momentum width with increasing neutron excess, reflecting enhanced attenuation and surface bias induced by neutron skins. The effect is significantly stronger for two-proton removal, suggesting that (p,3p) reactions may offer enhanced sensitivity to isovector nuclear structure. These findings establish proton-induced knockout reactions as complementary hadronic probes of neutron skins and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Description of Rotational Nuclear Fission Elucidates Fragment Spin Generation and Scission Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of fission fragment spin as a probe of scission mechanism remains a question of considerable interests. We present here microscopic calculations of rapidly rotating fission of the compound nucleus 240Pu under varying initial conditions within the time-dependent density functional theory framework. The obtained spin ratio of light to heavy nascent fragments is unchanged up to high spins but diminished as excitation energies increase, indicating sawtooth structures in fragment spins would fade away at high excitations rather than high angular momentum. Further analysis elucidates that the bending scission mode is predominated at low excitation energies, which has been under intense debates. Results also show thicker and elongated neck configurations, along with scission nucleons emitted perpendicular to the fission axis, owing to rapid rotations. These findings offer insights into the scission mechanism of rotating compound nuclei that have usually been overlooked in earlier studies.</description>

      <title>Comment on QED Corrections to the Parity Violating Asymmetry in High-Energy Electron-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent letter Roca-Maza and Jakubassa-Amundsen claim a large $\approx 5\%$ radiative correction to the parity-violating asymmetry $A_{pv}$ in electron-nucleus scattering. If true, this would be important for the interpretation of the PREX, CREX, and MREX experiments. However, Roca-Maza and Jakubassa-Amundsen do not explicitly include the axial-vector vertex correction to $Z^0$ exchange (at the momentum transfer of the experiment). We show that including this cancels much of the change in $A_{pv}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for the tetraneutron resonance on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the tetraneutron ($4n$) system remains a pivotal question in nuclear physics. We investigate the $4n$ system using nuclear lattice effective field theory in finite volumes with a lattice size up to $L=30$~fm, employing both a high-precision N$^3$LO interaction and a simplified SU(4) symmetric one. The ground-state energy is found to decrease smoothly with increasing box size, showing no plateau characteristic of a resonance. We further compute the dineutron-dineutron scattering phase shift using L\"uscher's finite-volume method. The phase shift is negative at low momenta, indicating repulsion in the dilute limit. At intermediate momenta, it exhibits a weak attraction with a peak of approximately $10^\circ$ at relative momentum of 60-84~MeV. While this structure does not constitute a resonance, the corresponding confined $4n$ energy of 1.7-3.3~MeV lies close to the experimentally observed low-energy peak.</description>

      <title>Exploring bound states and interactions of the nucleon-antinucleon system in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleon-antinucleon system in a constituent quark model. We first construct the nucleon-antinucleon wave function such that the multiquark and multiantiquark components each satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle, and then investigate the possibility of a bound state using a Hamiltonian that includes color-color, spin-dependent interactions and three-quark potentials. Our results indicate that, in specific channels, the nucleon-antinucleon interaction exhibits significant attraction, suggesting a strong possibility of a bound state.</description>

      <title>Investigating $\Omega \phi$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interaction between the $\Omega$ baryon and the $s\bar{s}$ meson within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model. The spectra calculations show that no bound state is formed in any of the considered channels, while the scattering indicates that the $\Omega\phi$ interaction with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ is weakly attractive. As for the $\Omega\phi$ interactions with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$, as well as the $\Omega\eta^{\prime}$ interaction with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$, they are all repulsive. After an investigation on the femtoscopic correlation functions, we find that, due to the spin-averaging effect, the overall $\Omega\phi$ correlation function exhibits a weak dependence on the source size, which provides a crucial significance of our model for future experimental examinations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers with SPHINCS_BSSN: temperature-dependent equations of state and damping of constraint violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers hold the key to several grand challenges of contemporary (astro-)physics. In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Viscosity: from Unitarity to Irreversibility in Accelerated Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the unitarity of quantum field theory, through the positivity of spectral functions, underlies thermodynamic irreversibility for a subsystem separated by a horizon, in direct analogy with the irreversibility of renormalization-group flows. To this end, we explicitly find the shear and bulk viscosities -- the entanglement viscosities -- for thermal radiation in Rindler space using the universal spectral representation. A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound.</description>

      <title>Anti-collinear resummation in JIMWLK evolution in the linear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently-proposed resummation procedure for anti-collinear logarithms in the JIMWLK kernel~\cite{Kovner:2023vsy} is studied in the linear (BFKL) regime in the fixed-coupling approximation. Simple closed form expressions for the resummed momentum space kernel and characteristic function $\chi(n,\gamma)$ are found. We find that the anti-collinear pole in the leading order characteristic function at $\gamma=1$ disappears, and instead $\chi(\gamma=1)=\frac{12}{11}\frac{\pi}{\alpha_sN_c}$ for $n_F=0$. Comparison with the known NLO BFKL eigenvalue, with the target-Bjorken limit ($Q_T\gg Q_P$) of the $\gamma^*(Q_P)+\gamma^*(Q_T)$-scattering amplitude and with the ``all-poles'' resummation prescription are presented.</description>

      <title>Resolution of the hyperfine puzzle and its significance for two fermion Dirac atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom of assumed radius $R$ is proportional to $-1/R^3$, raising the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen, or positronium. We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\hbar/2mc$, but when $R&lt;\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Recombination of $B_c$ mesons in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy heavy-ion collisions have been suggested as a favorable environment for the production of $B_c$ mesons, due to a much larger abundance of charm and bottom quarks compared to elementary reactions. Motivated by recent CMS data for $B_c^+$ production in Pb-Pb($5.02\,$TeV) collisions at the LHC, we deploy a previously developed transport approach for charmonia and bottomonia to evaluate the kinetics of $B_c$ mesons throughout the fireball formed in these reactions. The main inputs to our approach are two transport parameters: the $B_c$'s reaction rate and equilibrium limit. Both quantities are determined by previous calculations via a combination of charm and bottom sectors. In-medium binding energies of $B_c$ mesons are calculated from a thermodynamic $T$-matrix with a lattice-QCD constrained potential, and figure in their inelastic reaction rates. Temperature-dependent equilibrium limits include charm- and bottom-quark fugacities based on their initial production. We compute the centrality dependence of inclusive $B_c$ production and transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra using two different recombination models, instantaneous coalescence and resonance recombination. The main uncertainty in the resulting nuclear modification factors, $R_{\rm AA}$, is currently associated with the $B_c$ cross section in elementary $pp$ collisions, caused by the uncertainty in the branching ratio for the $B_c^-\to J/\psi\mu^-\bar \nu$ decay. Our results indicate a large enhancement of the $R_{\rm AA}$ at low $p_T$, with significant regeneration contributions up to $p_T\simeq\,20\,$GeV. Comparisons to CMS data are carried out but firm conclusions will require a more accurate value of the branching ratio, or alternative channels to measure the $B_c$ production in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an update on our semi-classical transport approach for quarkonium production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, focusing on $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons in 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at both forward and mid-rapidity. In particular, we employ the most recent charm-production cross sections reported in pp collisions, which are pivotal for the magnitude of the regeneration contribution, and their modifications due to cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects. Multi-differential observables are calculated in terms of nuclear modification factors as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity, including the contributions from bottom-decay feeddown. For our predictions for $\psi(2S)$ production, the mechanism of sequential regeneration relative to the more strongly bound $J/\psi$ meson plays an important role in interpreting recent ALICE data.</description>

The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quarkonium dissociation rates in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quarks and quarkonia are versatile probes of the transport properties of the hot QCD medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHICs). A robust description of heavy-flavor transport coefficients requires a microscopic approach that treats the open and hidden heavy-flavor sectors on the same footing. Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear beta decay using lattice quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} calculation of nuclear $\beta$ decay within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT), employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods to solve the nuclear many-body problem. Our approach combines next-to-next-to-leading order two- and three-body chiral interactions with one- and two-body axial current operators, all consistently derived in chiral effective field theory. Low-energy constants are determined exclusively from nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and few-body observables for systems with $A \leq 3$. Using these interactions and transition operators, we perform two-channel Monte Carlo simulations to compute the $\beta$-decay matrix element for $^6$He, obtaining results in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. To address the Monte Carlo sign problem, we implement a perturbative expansion around a leading-order Hamiltonian with approximate Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. This systematic approach provides a foundation for extending NLEFT simulations to precision studies of weak processes in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>Sign-Problem-Free Nuclear Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods offer exact solutions for quantum many-body systems but face severe limitations in fermionic systems like atomic nuclei due to the sign problem. While sign-problem-free QMC algorithms exist and provide valuable insights across disciplines, they have been restricted to simple models with limited quantitative predictive power. Here we overcome this barrier by developing a novel lattice nuclear force that is rigorously sign-problem-free for even-even nuclei. This interaction achieves a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.932$ MeV from experimental binding energies for 76 even-even nuclei ($N,Z \leq 28$), matching state-of-the-art phenomenological mean-field models. Key innovations include the first sign-problem-free implementation of spin-orbit coupling for shell evolutions and an efficient QMC-optimized framework for global parameter fitting. Using this approach, we compute binding energies from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn with unprecedented one-thousandth level numerical precision, reproduce symmetric nuclear matter saturation, and reveal novel spin-orbit-driven clustering in light nuclei. This work transforms sign-problem-free QMC into a scalable and predictive nuclear structure tool, while establishing a high-fidelity, non-perturbative foundation for \textit{ab initio} calculations of heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven High-Precision Model for $\alpha$-Decay Energy and Half-Life Prediction of superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) framework optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we investigated the {\alpha}-decay energy and half-life of superheavy nuclei. By incorporating key nuclear structural features-including mass number, proton-to-neutron ratio, magic number proximity, and angular momentum transfer-the optimized model captures essential physical mechanisms governing $\alpha$-decay. On the test set, the model achieves significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to empirical models such as Royer and Budaca, particularly in the low-energy region. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms these mechanisms are dominated by decay energy, angular momentum barriers, and shell effects. This work establishes a physically consistent, data-driven tool for nuclear property prediction and offers valuable insights into $\alpha$-decay processes from a machine learning perspective.</description>

      <title>On non-flow suppression in an MLE-based flow analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is an effective tool for mitigating non-flow effects in flow analysis. To this end, one constructs two toy models that simulate non-flow contributions corresponding to particle decay and momentum conservation, respectively. The performance of MLE is analyzed by comparing it against standard approaches such as particle correlation and event plane methods. For both cases, MLE is observed to provide a reasonable estimate of the underlying flow harmonics, and in particular, its performance can be further improved when the specific form of the likelihood in the presence of non-flow can be assessed. The dependencies of extracted flow harmonics on the multiplicity of individual events and the total number of events are analyzed. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed approach performs efficiently in addressing deficiencies in detector acceptance. These findings suggest MLE as a compelling alternative to standard methods for flow analysis.</description>

      <title>Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian with octic potential applied to the $^{106-116}$Cd isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian, with an octic potential in the $\beta$-deformation variable, is numerically solved for a $\gamma$-unstable symmetry of the nuclear system. The analytical structure of the model allows the description of multiple phenomena of great interest for the nuclear structure such as ground-state shape phase transitions and their critical points, dynamical shape phase transitions, shape coexistence with and without mixing, anomalous in-band $E2$ transitions, large $E2$ intra-band transitions and large monopole transition between the first excited $0^+$ state and the ground state, respectively. As a first application of the present model is selected the $^{106-116}$Cd isotope chain known in literature to manifest shape phase transition, respectively shape coexistence and mixing.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach for predicting multiple observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13163v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a neural network model, based on the processes of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, to study and predict several experimental observables in Au+Au collisions. We present a data-driven deep learning framework for predicting multiple bulk observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. A single neural network is trained exclusively on experimental measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions, transverse-momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients over a broad range of collision energies and centralities. The network architecture is inspired by the stages of a heavy-ion collision, from the quark-gluon plasma to chemical and kinetic freeze-out, and employs locally connected hidden layers and a structured input design that encodes basic geometric and kinematic features of the system. We demonstrate that these physics-motivated choices significantly improve test performance compared to purely fully connected baselines. The trained model is then used to predict the above observables at collision energies not yet explored experimentally at RHIC, and the results are validated using the energy dependence of the total charged-particle multiplicity per participant pair as well as comparisons to a CLVisc hydrodynamic calculation with TRENTo initial conditions. Our findings indicate that such physics-guided neural networks can serve as efficient surrogates to fill critical data gaps at RHIC and to support further phenomenological studies of QGP properties.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Effective Parameters from Transverse Momentum Spectra of Heavy Quarkonia in Proton-Proton Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also serves as the initial effective temperature (effective temperature at the initial stage) of small collision systems. This is because, despite the absence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation during the collisions, which leaves $T$ largely unaffected by QGP-related effects, the initial geometric asymmetry and local partonic thermalization still induce radial and transverse flows, thereby contributing to an increase in $T$. The effective parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantized vortices under quasi-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of K\'arm\'an vortex streets and perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>
