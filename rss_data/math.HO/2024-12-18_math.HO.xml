      <title>A chronology of continued square roots and other continued compositions, through the year 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the $t_i$ are maps from a set $D$ to itself, the initial value $c$ is a point in $D$, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.
  This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and $f$-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the $t_i$ are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.</description>

      <title>Controlling Equational Reasoning in Large Language Models with Prompt Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how hallucination rates in Large Language Models (LLMs) may be controlled and mitigated via a symbolic data generation framework, and explores a fundamental relationship between the rate of certain mathematical errors and interventions. Specifically, we systematically generate data for a derivation generation task, and apply targeted interventions on prompts to perturb aspects such as the surface forms of symbols, equational tree structures, and mathematical context, and evaluate the effect of prompt interventions across a range of LLMs including fine-tuned T5 models, GPT, and others. Experiments suggest that T5-Large can outperform the few-shot performance of GPT-4 on various evaluation sets generated via the framework, however, an extensive evaluation based on human analysis, template-based error detection, and various text generation metrics reveals fine-tuned model weaknesses beyond what the reference-based metrics singularly describe. We use these results to tie characteristic distributional footprints of interventions to the human evaluation of LLM derivation quality, potentially leading to significant control over fine-grained mathematical capabilities of language models with respect to specific types of errors.</description>

      <title>Apriori Knowledge in an Era of Computational Opacity: The Role of AI in Mathematical Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we acquire apriori knowledge of mathematical facts from the outputs of computer programs? People like Burge have argued (correctly in our opinion) that, for example, Appel and Haken acquired apriori knowledge of the Four Color Theorem from their computer program insofar as their program simply automated human forms of mathematical reasoning. However, unlike such programs, we argue that the opacity of modern LLMs and DNNs creates obstacles in obtaining apriori mathematical knowledge from them in similar ways. We claim though that if a proof-checker automating human forms of proof-checking is attached to such machines, then we can obtain apriori mathematical knowledge from them after all, even though the original machines are entirely opaque to us and the proofs they output may not, themselves, be human-surveyable.</description>
