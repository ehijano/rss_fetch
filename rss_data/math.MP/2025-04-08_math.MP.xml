      <title>A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless electrons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless electrons living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three subgroup type eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a two-dimensional two-sheeted hyperboloid are considered and all interbasis expansions between them are calculated. It is shown how the coefficients determining the expansions and the expansions themselves between subgroup basis contract from the hyperboloid to the Euclidean plane.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the locality of generalized global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine generalized global symmetries as a kind of compactly supported cohomology, and so are led to revisit questions about the locality of quantum field theory, following Segal. Physics naturally suggests a generalization of factorization algebras, aimed at capturing nonperturbative information, and we explain how higher group symmetries offer examples of this generalization, providing an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie. Finally, we explore how continuous generalized symmetries and anomalies can be cast in this framework.</description>

      <title>NQG III -- Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hunt for WIMPish dark matter and testing our new theory, we extend the results obtained for the Kepler problem in NQG I and NQG II to the Euler two-centre problem and to other classical Hamiltonian systems with planar periodic orbits. In the first case our results lead to quantum elliptical spirals converging to elliptical orbits where stars and other celestial bodies can form as the corresponding WIMP/molecular clouds condense. The examples inevitably involve elliptic integrals as was the case in our earlier work on equatorial orbits of toy neutron stars (see Ref. [27]). Hence this is the example on which we focus in this work on quantisation. The main part of our analysis which leans heavily on Hamilton-Jacobi theory is applicable to any KLMN integrable planar periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems. The most useful results on Weierstrass elliptic functions needed in these two works we have summarised with complete proofs in the appendix. This has been one of the most enjoyable parts of this research understanding in more detail the genius of Weierstrass and Jacobi. However we have to say that the beautiful simplicity of the Euler two-centre results herein transcend even this as far as we are concerned. At the end of the paper we see how the Burgers-Zeldovich fluid model relates to our set-up through Nelson's stochastic mechanics.</description>

      <title>Non-associative Algebras of Cubic Matrices and their Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by M-theory, we define a new type of non-associative algebra involving usual and cubic matrices at the same time. The resulting algebra can be regarded as a two-term truncated $L_\infty$ algebra giving rise to a fundamental identity between the two- and the three-bracket. We provide a simple class of concrete examples of such algebras based on the structure constants of a Lie algebra. Connecting to previous results on higher structures, we generalize the construction of Yang-Mills theories, topological BF theory and generalized IKKT models and point out some appearing issues.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantization of generalized Hirzebruch fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hirzebruch surfaces, defined as the projectivization of line bundles over $\C\mathbb{P}^1$, support a toric action and thus represent an infinite class of symplectic toric manifolds of complex dimension 2. In this paper, an infinite class of toric manifolds given as projective bundles over $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^d$ will be constructed for every complex dimension $d$ and it will be shown that each manifold supports a symplectic structure. With the toric and symplectic structure of the manifolds at our disposal, we then study their geometric quantization and how it relates to different values of the twisting parameter of the fibrations.</description>

      <title>Classifying Isolated Symplectic Singularities via 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Decay and Fission Conjecture, we provide a classification of unitary quivers whose 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb branches exhibit isolated singularities. This yields the complete list of isolated conical symplectic singularities that can arise in this way. In the process, we identify three new families of stable quivers: two giving rise to previously unknown isolated symplectic singularities, and one offering a novel realization of a known family.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low Equations: Eigensystem Analysis and Applications to One-Dimensional Test Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low (CGL) equations describe one of the simplest plasma flow models that allow anisotropic pressure, i.e., pressure is modeled using a symmetric tensor described by two scalar pressure components, one parallel to the magnetic field, another perpendicular to the magnetic field. The system of equations is a non-conservative hyperbolic system. In this work, we analyze the eigensystem of the CGL equations. We present the eigenvalues and the complete set of right eigenvectors. We also prove the linear degeneracy of some of the characteristic fields. Using the eigensystem for CGL equations, we propose HLL and HLLI Riemann solvers for the CGL system. Furthermore, we present the AFD-WENO schemes up to the seventh order in one dimension and demonstrate the performance of the schemes on several one-dimensional test cases.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Connections in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, in the setting of noncommutative differential geometry, a system of higher order connections is equivalent to a suitable generalization of the notion of phase space quantization (in the sense of Moyal star products on the symbol algebra). Moreover, we show that higher order connections are equivalent to (ordinary) connections on jet modules. This involves introducing the notion of natural linear differential operator, as well as an important family of examples of such operators, namely the Spencer operators, generalizing their corresponding classical analogues. Spencer operators form the building blocks of this theory by providing a method of converting between the different manifestations of higher order connections. A system of such higher order connections then gives a quantization, by which we mean a splitting of the quotient projection that defines symbols as classes of differential operators up to differential operators of lower order. This yields a notion of total symbol and of star product, the latter of which corresponds, when restricted to the classical setting, to phase space quantization in the context of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation, we allow the analogues of the position coordinates to form a possibly noncommutative algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics provides the arguably most fundamental example of hybrid dynamics: As long as no measurement takes place, the system state is governed by the Schr\"odinger-Liouville differential equation, which is however interrupted and replaced by projective dynamics at times when measurements take place. We show how this alternatingly continuous and projective evolution can be cast in form of one single differential equation for a refined state space manifold and thus be made amenable to standard port-theoretic analysis and control techniques.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and Lattice Walk Avoiding a Quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann boundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional equations arising in lattice walk enumeration. A matrix cRBVP is defined as integrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one catalytic variable. Our central results establish that the integrability depends on the eigenspace of some matrix associated to the problem. For lattice walks in three quadrants, we demonstrate how the obstinate kernel method transforms discrete difference equations into $3 \times 3$ matrix cRBVPs. The special doubleroots eigenvalue 1/4 yields two independent polynomial equations in the problem. The other single-root eigenvalue yields a linear equation. Crucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to models satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about the orbit-sum proposed by various researchers and also works for walks starting outside the quadrant.</description>

      <title>Contraction and concentration of measures with applications to theoretical neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems featuring either globally contracting or $B_{r}$-contracting drift terms. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the contraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting only outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of physical theories whose dynamics are given by natural equations, which are partial differential equations determined by a functor from the category of n-manifolds, for some n, to the category of fiber bundles, satisfying certain further conditions. We show how the theory of natural equations clarifies several important foundational issues, including the status and meaning of minimal coupling, symmetries of theories, and background structure. We also state and prove a fundamental result about the initial value problem for natural equations.</description>

      <title>Fractional Time-Delayed differential equations: Applications in Cosmological Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine time-delayed differential equations, discussing first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We derive their characteristic equations and solve them using the Laplace transform. We derive a modified evolution equation for the Hubble parameter incorporating a viscosity term modeled as a function of the delayed Hubble parameter within Eckart's theory. We extend this equation using the last-step method of fractional calculus, resulting in Caputo's time-delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations.</description>

      <title>Graphical functions with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces.
  As an application (in this article used mainly to prove consistency and efficiency of the method), we calculate Feynman periods in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.</description>

      <title>A Lorentz Covariant Matrix Model for Bosonic M2-Branes: Nambu Brackets and Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous approaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full 11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing a novel gauge-fixing condition that restricts the symmetry of volume-preserving deformations (VPD) to a subclass, which we call restricted VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a consistent matrix regularization of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the long-standing obstructions related to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental Identity. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorentz-invariant, nonperturbative matrix description of M2-branes. Our work offers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant matrix models of membranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying M-theory.</description>

      <title>On the structure of DHR bimodules of abstract spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice which are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains. Assuming that the charge transporters generate the algebra of observables, we prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.</description>

      <title>Singularity and regularity of the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate solution to the ill-posed 2D Stochastic Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the spatial properties of the SHF. We prove that, as a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This is obtained by probing a "quasi-critical" regime and showing the asymptotic log-normality of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength is sent to zero at a suitable rate, accompanied by similar results for critical 2D directed polymers. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is a.s. H\"older $C^{-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, implying the absence of atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Up-to-constants estimates on four-arm events for simple conformal loop ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove up-to-constants estimates for a general class of four-arm events in simple conformal loop ensembles, i.e. CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$. The four-arm events that we consider can be created by either one or two loops, with no constraint on the topology of the crossings. Our result is a key input in our series of works arxiv:2409.16230 and arxiv:2409.16273 on percolation of the two-sided level sets in the discrete Gaussian free field (and level sets in the occupation field of the random walk loop soup).
  In order to get rid of all constraints on the topology of the crossings, we rely on the Brownian loop-soup representation of simple CLE [Ann. Math. 176 (2012) 1827-1917], and a "cluster version" of a separation lemma for the Brownian loop soup. As a corollary, we also obtain up-to-constants estimates for a general version of four-arm events for SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$. This fixes (in the case of four arms and $\kappa\in(8/3,4]$) an essential gap in [Ann. Probab. 46 (2018) 2863-2907] and improves some estimates therein.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The partial integrability of the Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp Lieb-Thirring (LT) inequalities for the family of shifted Coulomb Hamiltonians. More precisely, we prove the classical LT inequalities with the semi-classical constant for this family of operators in any dimension $d\geq 3$ and any $\gamma \geq 1$. We also prove that the semi-classical constant is never optimal for the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum (CLR) inequalities for this family of operators in any dimension. In this case, we characterize the optimal constant as the minimum of a finite set and provide an asymptotic expansion as the dimension grows. Using the same method to prove the CLR inequalities for Coulomb, we obtain more information about the conjectured optimal constant in the CLR inequality for arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for states that are organized in a fractal and hierarchical manner within the energy landscape. This leads to a not necessarily time homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that improve our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We focus on Minkowski spacetime proving that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. We remark that this result can be extended to arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes, although, in this case one needs to exploit the existing regularization freedom in the construction of the Wick ordered stress-energy tensor.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study generally non-self-adjoint realizations of the Dirac operator on an arbitrary finite metric graph. Employing the robust boundary triple framework, we derive, in particular, a variant of the Birman Schwinger principle for its eigenvalues, and with an example of a star shaped graph we show that the point spectrum may exhibit diverse behaviour. Subsequently, we find sufficient and necessary conditions on transmission conditions at the graph's vertices under which the Dirac operator on the graph is symmetric with respect to the parity, the time reversal, or the charge conjugation transformation.</description>

Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>

      <title>Convergent Power Series for Anharmonic Chain with Periodic Forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the case of a pinned anharmonic chain of oscillators, with coordinates $({\bf q},{\bf p})=\{(q_x, p_x):\,x\in\mathbb Z_N=\{-N, ......, N\}\}$, subjected to an external driving force $
  F(\cdot)$ of period $\theta=2\pi/\omega$ acting on the oscillator at $x=0$. The system evolves according to a Hamiltonian dynamics with frictional damping, $\gamma&gt;0$, present at both endpoints $x=-N,N$. The Hamiltonian is given by $$ H_N({\bf q},{\bf p})=\sum_{x\in\mathbb Z_N}\Big[\frac{p_x^2}2 + \frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2 +\frac{\omega_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\nu\big( V(q_x)+ U(q_x-q_{x-1})\big)\Big],$$ where $V(\cdot)$ and $U(\cdot)$ are $C^2$ smooth anharmonic pinning and interaction potentials with bounded second derivatives, $\omega_0&gt;0$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$. We prove that if no integer multiplicity of $\omega$ falls into the spectrum of the infinite harmonic system $I:=[\omega_0 ,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4} ]$, then there exists a $\nu_0&gt;0$ such that for $\vert \nu\vert &lt;\nu_0$ the system approaches asymptotically in time a unique $\theta$-periodic solution, whose coordinates are given by a convergent power type series in $\nu$. The series coefficients are bounded and smooth functions of $\nu$. The value of $\nu_0$ is a lower bound on the radius of convergence, independent of $N$, the friction coefficient $\gamma&gt;0$ and ${\mathcal F}$. It depends only {on the supremum norm of $V''(\cdot)$ and $U''(\cdot)$} and the distance of the set of integer multiplicities of $\omega$ from $I$.</description>

Using this coupling, we define the renormalized powers of the Anderson free field and we prove that the associated quartic Gibbs measure is invariant under the flow of a nonlinear wave equation with renormalized cubic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$.

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively, by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this implies both exponential decay of local correlation functions and a classical algorithm for computing expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integral Formulations for Flexural Wave Scattering in Thin Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop second kind integral formulations for flexural wave scattering problems involving the clamped, supported, and free plate boundary conditions. While the clamped plate problem can be solved with layer potentials developed for the biharmonic equation, the free plate problem is more difficult due to the order and complexity of the boundary conditions. In this work, we describe a representation for the free plate problem that uses the Hilbert transform to cancel singularities of certain layer potentials, ultimately leading to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Additionally, for the supported plate problem, we improve on an existing representation to obtain a second kind integral equation formulation. With these representations it is possible to solve flexural wave scattering problems with high-order-accurate methods, examine the far field patterns of scattering objects, and solve large problems involving multiple scatterers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</description>

      <title>GPU-based compressible lattice Boltzmann simulations on non-uniform grids using standard C++ parallelism: From best practices to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and supersonic flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, creating accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy to address this challenge by integrating simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37) tailored to various flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and generalizes Rohde's refinement strategy.
  The framework's accuracy and robustness is validated across diverse benchmarks, including lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Modern C++ further enables our framework to reach GPU-native performance, while ensuring high portability, modularity, and ease of implementation. Notably, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency on non-uniform grids, while fully compressible LBMs benefit from acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. Our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects, providing new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids.
  Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across various flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>
