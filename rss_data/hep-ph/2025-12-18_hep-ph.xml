      <title>Implications of Flavor Symmetries for Baryon Number Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, baryon number is an accidental symmetry, whose violation would constitute unambiguous evidence of new physics, with proton decay providing its most prominent experimental signature. At the same time, the peculiar structure of flavor can serve as a guiding principle for exploring possible new-physics effects. In this work, we present a systematic classification of dimension-six baryon-number-violating (BNV) SMEFT operators across several flavor-symmetry assumptions and analyze the resulting phenomenology. Interestingly, in certain flavor scenarios the non-trivial interplay with tiny neutrino masses leads to proton-decay constraints compatible with BNV scales in the multi-TeV range. Finally, we complement the EFT analysis by identifying one-particle UV completions of the BNV operators, revealing scenarios in which the leading-order EFT description may not fully account for their underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Dicke States as Optimal Probes for Wave-Like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify symmetric Dicke states as the optimal quantum probes for distributed sensing of wave-like dark-matter fields. Within an ensemble-averaged quantum-metrological framework that incorporates the field's random phases and finite coherence, they maximize the Fisher information for short-baseline arrays with $N_d$ sensors and realize a robust $N_d^2$ enhancement. They also retain this collective advantage under amplitude-damping noise, whereas GHZ-type probes are highly fragile and rapidly lose their sensitivity once such noise is included. For two sensors at separations comparable to the dark-matter coherence length, the optimal entangled state acquires an additional spatial-correlation phase and outperforms both Dicke and independent probes. Our framework applies broadly to stochastic bosonic fields, including gravitational waves, and can be implemented with superconducting qubits, atomic ensembles, and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Pair Production via Gluon Fusion: Top-Yukawa- and light-quark-induced electroweak Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gluon fusion, $gg\to HH$, is the dominant Higgs-pair production process at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and provides the first direct access to the trilinear Higgs self-interaction. The process is loop-induced, with the main contribution emerging from top-quark loops within the Standard Model. In the past, the QCD corrections have been calculated and found to increase the cross section significantly. With the anticipated accuracies achievable at the high-luminosity LHC (HL--LHC), the theoretical uncertainties will be of increased relevance to compete with the experimental precision at the level of less than 30\%. In this work, we take the next steps towards the determination of the complete electroweak corrections at next-to-leading order by calculating the full top-Yukawa and light-quark induced corrections. These corrections modify the cross section moderately in the kinematical regimes of interest.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>

      <title>Opening the Parameter Space of sub-GeV Inelastic Dark Matter through Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) has emerged as a particularly compelling target in light of the persistent null results from conventional DM searches. While s-wave annihilating DM candidates with masses below the GeV are strongly constrained by indirect-detection bounds, inelastic scenarios can naturally evade these limits. In this work, we show that parity violation can play an important role in inelastic DM models featuring long-lived excited states by inducing small diagonal couplings that significantly relax experimental constraints. A precise determination of the excited-state abundance is essential for assessing the phenomenology of such models. To this end, we solve the integrated Boltzmann equation, fully accounting for up- and down-scattering with electrons and positrons as well as dark-sector conversion processes. Using the resulting abundance, we update the viable parameter space in light of the most recent experimental constraints and demonstrate that parity-violating interactions can reopen broad regions of parameter space that would otherwise be excluded. Moreover, the forthcoming LDMX experiment will probe a significant portion of the parameter space. The framework developed in this work can be readily applied to other exothermic sub-GeV DM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of U(1) Gauge Boson Kinetic Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories containing fields with the same quantum numbers allow for mixed kinetic terms in the Lagrangian, leading to off-diagonal elements in the tree-level two-point function. After removing the mixing by a field rotation, the off-diagonal UV divergences cannot be subtracted by a counterterm, still one can show that the theory is renormalizable. We study kinetic mixing of $U(1)$ gauge bosons in an extension of QED with a massive "dark" photon at one-loop order. In general covariant $R_\xi$-gauge, the gauge-fixing function naively obstructs the removal of tree-level mixing but we show that these off-diagonal gauge-dependent contributions cancel. We compare two renormalization schemes: one with and one without kinetic mixing, and relate them via a scale-dependent field transformation, showing that the schemes are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars as Portals to Extra-Dimensional Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hydrostatic configurations of asymmetric dark matter (DM) spheres in scenarios where fermionic DM can propagate into extra spatial dimensions, while Standard Model fields remain confined to ordinary three dimensions. As the number of extra dimensions increases, the effective equation of state for non-relativistic matter softens, making even modest DM accumulation inside neutron stars susceptible to gravitational collapse into extra-dimensional black holes. These black holes are longer lived than their $3$ dimensional counterparts and can accrete enough material to consume an entire neutron star, ultimately producing solar-mass black holes. For geometric cross sections, DM with masses above $\mathcal{O}(10\,{\rm TeV})$ may already be excluded for more than two extra dimensions of size ${\mathcal{O}(\rm fm})$ -- sharply contrasting with the standard $3$ dimensional case, where comparable limits only appear for masses $\gtrsim 10^{5}$ TeV at typical halo densities of $0.3\, \rm{GeV/cm^3}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Production of Sexaquark Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard thermal freeze-out scenarios with QCD-scale interaction rates predict a $uuddss$ sexaquark relic abundance many orders of magnitude below the observed dark matter density, representing a key challenge for sexaquark dark matter models. Additionally, if the maximum post-inflationary temperature never exceeds the QCD confinement scale, the usual thermal/chemical-equilibrium production of the sexaquark near ${T \sim T_{\rm QCD} \simeq 150 \text{-} 170~\mathrm{MeV}}$ never occurs. In this work we show that non-thermal mechanisms can naturally overcome this obstacle. Using late-decaying reheatons as a representative case (while noting the broader applicability), we demonstrate that the final abundance is determined by two quantities: the branching fraction into strange-quark-rich matter and the coalescence probability into sexaquarks during the matter-dominated or early radiation-dominated epoch. We provide compact expressions and benchmark calculations for reheating temperatures $T_R \in [10, 100]~\mathrm{MeV}$ and reheaton masses above the QCD confinement scale. Unlike the predictive but unsuccessful thermal scenario, non-thermal production is sensitive to injection microphysics, coalescence efficiency, and residual entropy dilution. We delineate the viable parameter space, evaluate collider and precision constraints on representative reheaton models, and derive indirect detection bounds on residual antisexaquark populations. Our results establish non-thermal production as a viable pathway to sexaquark dark matter and highlight broader implications for non-equilibrium mechanisms in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\boldsymbol{SU(N)}$: $\boldsymbol{U(3) \times U(2)}$ as the underlying symmetry of the strong and electroweak interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge principle is a cornerstone of particle-physics model building. Nevertheless, many constructions leave certain global $U(1)$ redundancies ungauged. In this work, we take the gauge principle to its logical extreme by promoting all $SU(N)$ symmetries to $U(N)$. We focus on a model based on local $U(3)\times U(2)$ invariance. This framework accounts for several otherwise ad hoc features of the Standard Model, including charge quantization and the observed hypercharge assignments, which emerge here as unique predictions. Furthermore, the internal consistency of the model requires the introduction of right-handed neutrinos and implies the presence of an additional $U(1)$ factor that can be identified with $B-L$, thereby naturally yielding non-zero neutrino masses. In light of these findings, we hypothesize that $U(3)\times U(2)$ constitutes the underlying symmetry of the strong and electroweak interactions. More importantly, our approach opens up novel avenues for model building, driven by this extended interpretation of the gauge principle.</description>

      <title>$i$-incidental $N$-naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $N$-naturalness is a novel solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem which posits $N$ copies of the Standard Model with varying Higgs mass-squared parameters. Reheating proceeds through a "reheaton" particle that deposits most of its energy density into the Standard Model and small but potentially measurable fractions into the other copies. Typically the sector with the lightest negative Higgs mass-squared is identified as the Standard Model. We demonstrate that $N$-naturalness admits a broader class of realizations in which the Standard Model is identified with a heavier sector, rather than being restricted to the lightest. This is made possible by resonant mixing between the reheaton and the Higgs, which generically causes one sector to be preferentially reheated and to acquire the largest share of the energy density, singling it out as the Standard Model. We demonstrate that this scenario is consistent with current cosmological bounds on new relativistic degrees of freedom and overclosure constraints from heavy stable relics, while future cosmic microwave background and high redshift surveys will probe significant portions of the remaining parameter space. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of a novel stochastic gravitational wave spectrum from the many cosmological first order QCD phase transitions occurring across the other sectors.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state of hot, dense nuclear matter plays a fundamental role in many areas. However, owing to the nonperturbative nature of strong interactions, a reliable treatment is still under debate. We use a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector\,$\otimes$\,vector contact interaction to study related issues at nonzero temperature or quark chemical potential, and carefully compare a noncovariant and a covariant regularization scheme. The numerical results show that the character of the phase transition depends sensitively on the regularization scheme and parameter choices.</description>

      <title>The domain of soft hadrons in transverse momentum space in high energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying experimental data for invariant transverse momentum distribution $f(p_{T})$ of hadrons in high energy $pp$, $p$A and AA collisions, we find two characteristic $p_{T}$ points relating to the behavior of $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$, i.e., the second derivative of the logarithm of hadronic $p_{T}$ spectrum with respect to $p_{T}$. One point is $p_{0}$ at which $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$ is zero and another point is $p_{1}$ at which $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$ reaches maximum. \bz{The hadronic distribution can be classified into three kinetic regions, i.e., soft region $0&lt;p_{T}&lt;p_{0}$ dominated by hadrons from soft parton system, hard region $p_{T}&gt;p_{1}$ dominated by hadrons from high energy partonic jet, and the transition region $p_{0}&lt;p_{T}&lt;p_{1}$ of above two sources of hadron production.} Using rich data of hadronic $p_{T}$ spectra at RHIC and LHC, we carry out a systematical analysis for $p_{0}$ and $p_{1}$ of kaon, $K^{*}$, $\phi$ and baryons such as $p$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ in $pp$, $p$-Pb and heavy-ion collisions, and show their dependence on hadron species, collision energy, collision centrality and/or charged-particle multiplicity. We also study the correlation between $p_{0}$ of hadrons and their average transverse momentum $\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $, and find a difference between $p_{0}$-$\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $ correlation of baryons and that of mesons which can be understood by quark combination mechanism at hadronization. The systematic comparison for $p_{0}$-$\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $ correlation of kaon, $\phi$, $p$ and $\Lambda$ in $pp$, $p$-Pb, Pb-Pb and Au+Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies indicates that $p_{0}$ is a sensitive physical quantity of reflecting the production property of soft hadrons in high energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particle Search with a Light-Shining-Through-Walls Setup at a $\gamma$-$\gamma$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have explored a practical extension of the conventional light-shining-through-walls technique by making direct use of the high-intensity $\gamma$-ray beam available at a $\gamma$-$\gamma$ collider. The energetic and highly collimated photon flux produced via inverse Compton scattering naturally provides an efficient ALP production stage, while the addition of a regeneration region downstream enables a complete LSW configuration without introducing new experimental complexities. This approach therefore represents an experimentally simple and infrastructure-compatible method for enhancing laboratory sensitivity to axion-like particles. Under conservative assumptions, we find that one year of operation can probe ALP-photon couplings down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq 3.82\times 10^{-5} \,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ for $m_a\lesssim 0.1 \,\mathrm{eV}$ when an additional magnetic region is included upstream of the beam dump, improving upon previous laboratory LSW limits by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Selected decays of $B_{s}$ meson in covariant confined quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of various $B_{s}$ meson decays, including hadronic and semileptonic final states with different spins and diagram topologies. The covariant confined quark model is employed to describe hadronic effects, and our analysis serves as a broad test of the current understanding of the underlying dynamics within the Standard Model. The level of agreement with experimental data varies across channels: it is good for the semileptonic decays $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$; acceptable for the hadronic modes $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}D^{+}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}$; marginal for $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}$, $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}$, and $B_{s}^{0}\to\phi\,J/\psi$; and significantly discrepant for $B_{s}^{0}\to\phi\,\overline{D^{0}}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\to\phi\,\eta_{c}$. We argue that the observed inconsistencies may arise from the breakdown of naive factorization and unaccounted long-distance effects. In particular, the channels $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}$ are theoretically among the cleanest nonleptonic decays, yet they exhibit persistent discrepancies also reported by other theoretical groups.</description>

      <title>Statistical repulsion on hyperons in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of hyperons in baryonic (diquark) matter in two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) by introducing heavy quark doublets that emulate strange quarks. An even number of flavors is required to avoid the sign problem in lattice Monte Carlo simulations. To explore QC$_2$D matter containing both light and heavy quarks, we construct a model in which quarks interact with light-light, light-heavy (hyperonic), and heavy-heavy diquarks via Yukawa couplings. As the quark chemical potential increases, the light diquarks condense first and form baryonic matter, and this onset density can be understood in hadronic terms. In contrast, the onset density of hyperons is substantially higher than that estimated from the hadronic sector of the model. This shift reflects an effective repulsion among baryons induced by the pre-occupied light quarks. The Pauli blocking of light quarks suppresses the attractive diquark correlations responsible, in vacuum, for making hyperons lighter than the sum of the constituent light and heavy quark masses. Implications for three-color QCD are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The effective running quark mass from the variational solution of the 4dimensional Bethe-Salpeter equation for charmonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scale dependence of the modulus of the effective charm quark mass is determined from measured values of leptonic decay constants and vector charmonium masses. Unlike nonrelativistic approximations, the Poincar\'e-invariant framework based on the full four-dimensional (4D) Bethe-Salpeter equation does not support a single-valued constituent quark mass approximation. To overcome the obstacles of low accuracy associated with standard methods, the variational method is used to solve the full 4D Bethe-Salpeter equations. This method achieves precise agreement with the experiment while avoiding unphysical abnormal states. The quark mass must slide to provide almost unique values for the charm running mass at the scale of individual charmonium states, achieving precise agreement with the experiment on one hand and avoiding unphysical abnormal states on the other.</description>

      <title>Resonant Type-II + Type-I Hybrid Leptogenesis in SO(10) with Triplet--Neutrino Mass Degeneracy $M_T \simeq M_{N_3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe remains one of the central open problems in particle physics and cosmology. We identify a new regime of \emph{hybrid resonant leptogenesis} in renormalizable SO(10) grand unified theories, where a quasi-degeneracy between the scalar triplet and the heaviest right-handed neutrino, \( M_T \simeq M_{N_3}, \) induces an unavoidable interference between type-I and type-II decay amplitudes. This interference gives rise to a physical CP-violating phase, \( \phi_{\rm HR} = \arg(\mu f Y_\nu^\dagger), \) which cannot be removed by field redefinitions and leads to a resonant enhancement of the baryon asymmetry without extreme Yukawa hierarchies or tuning. We show that the observed asymmetry, \( Y_B \simeq 8.7 \times 10^{-11}, \) is naturally reproduced for masses around \(10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}\), moderate washout, and \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) phases. The mechanism is predictive and testable, with correlated implications for lepton-flavour violation and electric dipole moments.</description>

      <title>An Extra-Dimensional Axion in a 5D Warped Orbifold GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the QCD axion arising from the 5th component of a bulk $U(1)$ gauge field in a five-dimensional warped grand unified theory, and determine the viable range of the axion decay constant $f_a$. Unlike flat extra dimensions, where gauge couplings run quickly above the Kaluza--Klein (KK) scale, the logarithmic running in warped geometries permits substantially smaller $f_a$ while preserving perturbative gauge coupling unification. However, bulk tree-level contributions to the gauge coupling -- interpreted holographically as CFT renormalization -- place a lower bound on $f_a$. We find that the conventional QCD axion window $10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim f_a \lesssim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ is readily compatible without losing perturbativity, provided the AdS curvature is near the Planck scale. Thus, the 5D warped orbifold GUT naturally accommodates a high-quality QCD axion in a grand unified theory that provides an effective description of string-theoretic warped flux compactifications, admitting complementary geometric and holographic descriptions of the axion.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Electroweak Two-Loop Corrections to Drell-Yan and Related Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a complete calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) electroweak fermionic corrections to fermion-pair production processes, where "fermionic" refers to contributions with closed fermion loops. We did this via a semi-numerical technique that used dispersion relations for the fermion sub-loop in two-loop box and vertex diagrams and dispersion relations and Feynman parameters for vertex diagrams with fermionic triangle sub-loops. UV and IR divergences are treated with suitable subtraction terms. We present numerical results for the cross-sections of $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-/u\bar{u}/d\bar{d}$ and differential distributions at representative center-of-mass energies. The NNLO corrections are found to modify the NLO cross-section on the order of 1%.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. The relation to dark matter is of importance.</description>

      <title>Radiative Spin Polarization in High Energy Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usual theoretical model for synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators (synchrotrons and storage rings) is to treat a single electron moving in a horizontal circle in a uniform vertical magnetic field, but the true situation in real storage rings is more complicated and exhibits much richer physics. The magnetic fields are inhomogeneous, and there is a bunch of many particles and they traverse a distribution of orbits (hence they encounter different magnetic fields). This results in so-called ``depolarizing spin resonances'' (which do not appear in a simple model of a uniform vertical magnetic field). The calculation of the equilibrium electron spin polarization requires a much more careful analysis. For example, a key insight is that, for motion in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, ``spin flip'' is in general \emph{not} a $180^\circ$ reversal of the spin orientation. The physics of radiative spin polarization involves a mix of many disciplines, and provides a good example of cross-disciplinary thinking. We shall also briefly note the connection to astrophysics. The astrophysics literature mainly treats electron motion in very strong magnetic fields, stronger than the Schwinger critical field (for example a neutron star). It is a problem of ongoing interest in astrophysics to study the radiation by electrons circulating in such strong magnetic fields. This article aims to provide the reader with a survey of the basic physics principles of radiative spin polarization, omitting low-level mathematical algebra as much as possible. Such details can be found in the literature, and are not relevant here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dispersion integral representation of the Heisenberg-Euler QED effective lagrangian is derived, with Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm as a generalized Borel kernel. The nonperturbative imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is expressed as the quantum dilogarithm, while the real part has the form of a dispersion integral involving both the quantum dilogarithm and its modular dual, a manifestation of electromagnetic duality. The Heisenberg-Euler effective lagrangian generates all one-loop QED scattering amplitudes in a constant external field, with the Lorentz invariants of the constant background electromagnetic field playing the role of the Mandelstam variables in conventional QED dispersion theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of the Standard Model (SM) there remains behaviour it cannot describe, in particular the presence of non-interacting Dark Matter. Many models that describe dark matter can generically introduce exotic Long-Lived Particles (LLPs). The proposed ANUBIS experiment is designed to search for these LLPs within the ATLAS detector cavern, located approximately 20-30 m from the Interaction Point (IP). A prototype detector, proANUBIS, has taken data within the ATLAS detector cavern since 2024, corresponding to 104 $fb^{-1}$ of pp data. We report on the potential sensitivity of ANUBIS to a selection of LLP models, i.e. Higgs Portal and Heavy Neutral Leptons, as well as future planned studies. Additionally, we will show the first results of the proANUBIS demonstrator, and how it will be used to study the expected backgrounds for the ANUBIS detector.</description>

      <title>Evidence of partonic collectivity in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions with NCQ scaling of radial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first observation of \textit{Number of Constituent Quark} (NCQ) scaling of the radial flow observable $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV are investigated using the string-melting version of the \texttt{AMPT} model, while Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV are analyzed using published ALICE data, with calculations from \texttt{PYTHIA8/Angantyr} serving as a non-collective baseline. The $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ spectra from \texttt{AMPT-SM} exhibit clear collective signatures, including mass ordering at lower-$p_{\rm T}$ and a meson-baryon separation at intermediate-$p_{\rm T}$, which are absent in the baseline calculations. In central collisions, $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})/n_q$ follows robust NCQ scaling when expressed as a function of transverse kinetic energy per quark, $(m_{\rm T}-m_{0})/n_q$, while significant deviations emerge toward peripheral events, indicating a stronger manifestation of collectivity in central collisions. The scaling is more precise at RHIC than at LHC energies, consistent with earlier observations for elliptic flow $v_2$. These findings provide strong evidence that radial collectivity is established predominantly at the partonic stage of the fireball evolution.</description>

      <title>BBNet: accurate neural network emulator for primordial light element abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational wave-galaxy cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure for the first time the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the cross-correlation of galaxies and gravitational waves (GW), by applying the $\textit{Peak Sirens}$ method. This method consists of finding the peak of the 3D angular cross-spectrum $C_{\ell}(z,D_L)$ between the galaxy redshifts ($z$) and the GW luminosity distances ($D_L$). Using two GW events from the GWTC-3.0 catalog and the GLADE+ galaxy catalog, we make the first detection of the cross-correlation peak at $5.9\sigma$ confidence. This signal comes mostly from the best localized event in the catalog, GW190814, which alone provides a $3.4\sigma$ significance. Adding also the multimessenger event GW170817, but without using its known redshift, we find $H_0 = 67^{+18}_{-15}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and the first observational constraint on the GW bias, $b_{\rm gw} &lt; 4.3$ at 95% CI. These measurements set the stage for future novel cosmological constraints with this technique.</description>

      <title>The art of simulating the early Universe. Part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of non-canonical field theory circumstances, complementing our previous monograph (arXiv:2006.15122) on canonical cases. We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.</description>

      <title>Note on bulk viscosity as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity, which characterizes the irreversible dissipative resistance of a fluid to volume changes, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for explaining both early- and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the spin/anisotropy of the CCOs of Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 and a single surviving continuous gravitational wave candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

      <title>The Lepton Flavor Changing Decays and One-loop Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment in the Extended Mirror Twin Higgs Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mirror Twin Higgs(MTH) models always contain heavy gauge bosons and extra Higgses. Besides, to accommodate tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism, new heavy neutrinos can also be introduced in MTH extension models. Such new particles and interactions may lead to new contributions to the lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes, including $\ell_i \to \ell_j\gamma$ and $\ell_i \to \ell_j\ell_k\ell_l$. We find that current experimental data can stringently constrain the parameter spaces and certain LFV processes can possibly be tested by the next generation colliders. One-loop contributions of the new particles to the muon anomalous magnetic momentumare also calculated. Such contributions can still not solve the discrepancy between the experiments and the prediction of the standard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar field with a nonzero vacuum expectation value. The dynamics of inflation are governed by two parameters, the vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which together give rise to a rich variety of inflationary structures. We classify the possible trajectories of the two inflaton fields and identify the parameter regions consistent with current cosmological observations. Furthermore, we investigate the reheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the subsequent generation of lepton number within these regions. Our findings suggest that the presence of multiple scalar degrees of freedom can significantly alter the conditions for successful reheating and leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino asymmetry from forbidden decay of dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM), in spite of being stable or long-lived on cosmological scales, can decay in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. In particular, a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe can provide a finite window for such decay, guaranteeing DM stability at lower temperatures, consistent with observations. The FOPT can lead to the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) with peak frequencies correlated with DM mass. On the other hand, early DM decay into neutrinos can create a large neutrino asymmetry which can have interesting cosmological consequences in terms of enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, providing a solution to the recently observed Helium anomaly among others. Allowing DM decay to occur below sphaleron decoupling temperature, thereby avoiding overproduction of baryon asymmetry, forces the FOPT to occur at sub-electroweak scale. This leaves the stochastic GW within range of experiments like LISA, $\mu$ARES, NANOGrav etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling from hadronic $\tau$-decay data including $\tau\to\pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ from Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we have combined the $\pi^-\pi^0$, $2\pi^-\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-3\pi^0$ spectral data obtained from hadronic $\tau$ decays measured by the ALEPH and OPAL experiments, together with electroproduction data for several of the subleading hadronic modes and BaBar data for the $K\bar{K}$ mode to construct an inclusive non-strange vector spectral function entirely based on experimental data, with no Monte-Carlo generated input. In this paper, we include, for the first time, the Belle $\tau\to\pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ high-statistics decay data to construct a new inclusive non-strange vector spectral function that combines more of the world's available data. As no Belle data are at present available for the two $4\pi$ modes, this requires a revised data analysis in comparison with our previous work. From the resulting new spectral function, we obtain a new determination of the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, using our previously developed strategy based on finite-energy sum rules. We find, at the $Z$ mass scale, $\alpha_s(m_Z^2)=0.1159(14)$. We discuss the smaller central value and larger error of our new result compared to our previous result, showing the shifts to be due mainly to significant changes in updated HFLAV results for the $\pi^-3\pi^0$ decay mode.</description>

Abstract: We present next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the cross sections for $\ell p^\uparrow\to hX$, $\ell p^\uparrow\to {\mathrm{jet}}X$ with transversely polarized initial protons. These cross sections are known to be power-suppressed in QCD and probe twist-3 parton correlation functions in the proton. Our calculation exhibits the full complexity of a perturbative QCD analysis beyond leading power, involving in particular various derivatives of the parton correlation functions. We demonstrate that collinear factorization for these single-spin observables holds at one loop. We also present exploratory phenomenological results for the NLO single-spin asymmetry in $ep^\uparrow\to hX$ and compare to data from the HERMES experiment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the single-spin asymmetry for the single-inclusive production of hadrons and jets in collisions of transversely polarized nucleons and unpolarized leptons, $\ell N^\uparrow \to (h\,\mathrm{or\,jet})X$. We compute the spin-dependent cross section within collinear twist-3 factorization in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In this approach, multiparton correlations generate a non-vanishing effect. For the present paper, we focus on correlations in the nucleon initial-state rather than in the fragmentation process. We explicitly verify that collinear twist-3 factorization is valid at the one-loop level. Our analytical results show that at NLO the relevant multiparton correlation functions in the nucleon are probed on their full support in momentum fractions. Our numerical analysis for collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider indicates that the NLO corrections can be large and are sensitive to the functional form of the twist-3 correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon and lepton number are excellent low-energy symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) that tightly constrain the form of its extensions. In this paper we investigate the possibility that these accidental symmetries are violated in the deep UV, in such a way that one multiplet necessary for their violation lives at an intermediate energy scale $M$ above the electroweak scale. We write down the simplest effective operators containing each multiplet that may couple linearly to the SM at the renormalisable level and estimate the dominant contribution of the underlying UV model to the pertinent operators in the SMEFT: the dimension-5 Weinberg operator and the baryon-number-violating operators up to dimension 7. Our results are upper bounds on the scale $M$ for each multiplet--operator pair, derived from neutrino-oscillation data as well as prospective nucleon-decay searches. We also analyse the possibility that both processes are simultaneously explained within a natural UV model. In addition, we advocate that our framework provides a convenient and digestible way of organising the space of UV models that violate these symmetries.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraint on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Going beyond these (to date theory-specific) insights, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution that holds in any quantum field theory with any coupling strength. This condition, which is the generalization of the Einstein relation to quantum field theories which feature non-Gaussian fluctuations, reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

      <title>Improving the description of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions using the SACOT-$\chi$ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimuon production in deeply inelastic scattering between neutrinos and nuclei plays an important role in constraining the strange-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs). Here, we present a self-contained calculation of this process consisting of a next-to-leading order semi-inclusive charmed-hadron production in the SACOT-$\chi$ general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme, followed by a semi-leptonic decay of the charmed hadron. We find that invoking the SACOT-$\chi$ scheme introduces modifications up to $20 \, \%$ in comparison to our previous esimates, where only kinematic mass effects were considered through the slow-rescaling variable. We reiterate our earlier observation that the effective acceptance correction - typically used in global PDF fits as a simplifying approximation - depends on the perturbative order, PDFs, scales, and also on the treatment of heavy-quark effects. We find good agreement with the corresponding data from the NuTeV experiment.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy of $DN$ and $\bar{D}N$ systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism. We employ an effective Lagrangian to model the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons and apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels, incorporating the effect of the Coulomb interaction when the pair involves two charged particles. The resulting full coupled-channel wave function is inserted into the Koonin-Pratt equation with channel weights derived from a thermal model. Additionally, we compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation with low-energy scattering parameters extracted from the unitarized amplitudes. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs. Our results can be tested against current and future experimental data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Exclusive heavy vector meson photoproduction in $pp$ and $pPb$ collisions within the GPD approach: A phenomenological analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exclusive $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction in proton - proton ($pp$) and proton - lead ($pPb$) collisions at the LHC energies is investigated using the Generalized Parton Distribution (GDP) approach. Assuming the Goloskokov - Kroll (GK) model, we estimate the corresponding total cross - sections and rapidity distributions considering different parametrizations for the unpolarized gluon distribution of the proton. In particular, we compare the linear predictions, associated with DGLAP evolution, with those derived taking into account of the leading nonlinear corrections resulting from gluon recombination. The dependence of our predictions on the choice for the factorization scale is discussed.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Effects in the Neutrino Matter Potential and Implications for Non-Standard Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we emphasize that it is necessary to take into account one-loop corrections of $2.0\%$ to the neutrino matter potential in the precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and in the experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. With the numerical simulation of the DUNE experiment, we study how radiative corrections to the matter potential affect neutrino oscillation probabilities, and thus, the event rates in the presence of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs). We find that neglecting one-loop corrections may lead to wrong conclusions for the discovery of NSIs. The implications for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and constraints on the NSI parameters in future long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments are explored in a quantitative way.</description>

      <title>A Fast Earth-scattering Formalism for Light Dark Matter with Dark Photon Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the hadronic light-by-light amplitude of the holographic soft-wall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the WKB approximation to uncover divergences and instances of non-commuting limits in a large class of holographic soft-wall models. We show that the infinite sum over single resonance contributions for a variety of observables involving the Chern-Simons term, such as the VVA correlator or the hadronic light-by-light tensor, does not converge. These divergences can in some cases (such as the VVA correlator) be traced back to non-commuting limits and avoided by working directly in the 5-dimensional setup with bulk-to-boundary propagators. However, the hadronic light-by-light scattering tensor also diverges in the 5-dimensional formulation with corresponding Green functions, preventing a correct implementation of the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint and even leading to an infinite contribution to the muon $g-2$. We also discuss modifications of the standard soft-wall model that are able to resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Neutral Magnetic Monopole in the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model has the electroweak monopole which has the magnetic charge $4\pi/e$, as a hybrid between the Dirac and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4\pi/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm and -bottom tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ via QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm and hidden-bottom tetraquark states within the framework of QCD sum rules. The mass spectra are computed by including condensates up to dimension eight in the operator product expansion. Our results indicate the possible existence of four $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm tetraquark states, with predicted masses of $(4.83 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, $(4.88 \pm 0.18)$ GeV, $(4.72 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(4.79 \pm 0.12)$ GeV, while their hidden-bottom counterparts are estimated to have masses of $(11.08 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, $(11.16 \pm 0.14)$ GeV, $(10.99 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(11.03 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, respectively. We also analyze the possible decay modes of these tetraquark states, which may be accessible in future experiments at BESIII, Belle~II, and LHCb. These findings provide valuable guidance for the experimental search for exotic $1^{-+}$ tetraquark states in both the charm and bottom sectors.</description>

      <title>Potential for the discovery of the protophobic boson at the STCF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the morphology of the main drift chamber (MDC) proposed to be built around the collision point at the upcoming Super tau-charm facility (STCF), to check for its suitability in discovering the 17 MeV protophobic boson (X17 boson), hypothesised as a solution to the persistent ATOMKI nuclear-transition anomalies. These anomalies, observed in the excited $^8$Be, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclear transitions, have been interpreted as evidence for a $\sim$17 MeV, protophobic vector boson. Using the TrackEff framework, we perform detector-level simulations of the STCF MDC, and evaluate displaced-vertex sensitivities towards the protophobic boson, across the relevant mass-coupling parameter space. We study benchmark scenarios with visible and dark decay channels to perform likelihood-based significance estimates in order to determine the 5$\sigma$ discovery reach for the protophobic boson. We find that STCF can discover the protophobic boson while tolerating $\sim 10^4$ background events for specific regions of the parameter space around the 17 MeV peak. Our analysis establishes the first feasibility study of displaced light-boson searches at the STCF, motivating a full Geant-4 simulation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation on 21-cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy released from dark matter (DM) annihilation leads to additional ionization and heating of the intergalactic gas, impacting the hydrogen 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn. The dark matter annihilation rate scales with its density squared and becomes inhomogeneously boosted with structure formation. This paper examines the inhomogeneity in DM annihilation rate induced by the growth of DM halo structures, and we show that this effect can significantly amplify the spatial fluctuations in temperature and ionization fraction of the gas. Consequently, the fluctuations in the 21-cm brightness temperature may also be enhanced. We showcase these effects for a DM mass of 100 MeV annihilating into $\rm{e}^-\rm{e}^+$ at a rate of $\left&lt;\sigma v\right&gt;/m_\chi \sim 10^{-27} {\rm cm^3 s^{-1} GeV^{-1}}$, which is consistent with current constraints set by the cosmic microwave background. We find that, compared to the homogeneous calculations, inhomogeneous annihilation can enhance the 21-cm power spectrum by up to a factor of 130 over the scales of $k \in [0.05, 3]\ {\rm{Mpc^{-1}}}$ at redshifts $11-16$. Such signatures could potentially be detected by upcoming radio observatories such as the Square Kilometer Array telescope.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06476v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to the conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for four point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. We present the exclusion regions for the common mass-squared difference $\delta m^2$, inducing active-sterile oscillations, for all three neutrino flavors. This includes results from individual sources as well as from a stacking analysis that combines data from the four sources. Our findings indicate that the exclusion region is $\delta m^2 \in [2.1\times 10^{-21} - 2.0\times 10^{-16}]$ eV$^2$ with $\ge 90\%$ confidence level (CL) significance for neutrino energies ranging from 0.5 TeV to 1 PeV. When we extend the energy range down to 0.1 TeV, the exclusion region broadens to $\delta m^2 \in [1.1 \times 10^{-21} - 3.0\times 10^{-16}]$ eV$^2$ at $\ge 90\%$ CL.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a measurement of exclusive electroproduction of $\phi$ mesons near threshold in Hall C. We will measure the |t|-dependence of the exclusive $\phi$ electroproduction cross section, which has recently been proposed as an observable sensitive to the strangeness $D$-term. The contribution of strangeness to the total $D$-term is presently unknown, with different arguments favoring $D_s$ being large, being small, or even having opposite sign from the total $D$-term. Our exploratory measurement is designed to distinguish between these hypotheses. If $D_s$ turns out to be small, $\phi$ electroproduction can be used to study the gluon $D$-term. In addition, this dataset will allow us to perform measurements of other exclusive meson final states, including the first measurement of $\eta'$ electroproduction and multi-differential measurements of $\eta$ and $\omega$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 Tonne-Year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of 3.1 tonne-years. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Stronger Constraints on Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Derived from the Thermal Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium over the Last Twelve Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95\% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Center, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard model physics.</description>

      <title>Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim\!0.87\!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.</description>

      <title>Through the Heliospheric Lens: Directional Deflection of High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Electrons and Positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this "heliospheric lens" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions-from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. We model the deterministic deflections of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs) induced by large-scale heliospheric magnetic-field structures using a back-tracing approach. Our results apply to CREs above tens of GeV, where diffusion, convection, and adiabatic energy losses play a subdominant role; these processes are neglected in the present study and will be addressed in future work. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies.

      <title>Cosmic Strings Gravitational Wave Probe of Leptogenesis: Thermal, Non-thermal, Near-resonant and Flavourful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breaking a global or local $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry at high scales simultaneously generates Majorana masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements.</description>
