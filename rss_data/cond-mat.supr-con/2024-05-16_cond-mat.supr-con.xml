      <title>Reply to "Comment on `Nonstandard superconductivity or no superconductivity in hydrides under high pressure' "</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. [1] we surveyed the known hydride superconductors, and compared their resistive behavior to that of typical known superconductors, including conventional (e.g. NbN and MgB$_2$) and unconventional (e.g. YBCO) superconductors, and concluded that the behavior of the hydrides was indicative of nonstandard or no superconductivity. In the preceding comment, Talantsev, Minkov, Balakirev and Eremets [2] (arXiv:2311.07865) claim that we presented a "flawed analysis and a selective and inaccurate report of published data." Here we show that this claim is wrong.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of strongly-coupled Rashba systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of a possible field-mediated parity switch within the superconducting state of CeRh2As2 [Khim et al., Science 373, 1012 (2021)], we thoroughly investigate the dependence of the superconducting state of a strongly-coupled Rashba mono- and bilayer on internal parameters and an applied magnetic field. The role of interlayer pairing, spin orbit coupling, doping rate and applied magnetic field and their interplay was examined numerically at low temperature within a t-J-like model, uncovering complex phase diagrams and transitions between superconducting states with different symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ageing Effects on Superconducting Properties of BiS2-Based Compounds: First-12-Year Restudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposition of superconductors sometimes becomes crucial when studying essential physical properties of the superconductors. For example, the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d decomposes by long-time air exposure. In this study, we investigate the aging effects on superconducting properties of BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, both were first synthesized in 2012, using their polycrystalline samples synthesized several years ago. We find that 12-year-old Bi4O4S3 samples exhibit bulk superconductivity with a slight degradation of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 0.2 K. For a high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, clear decrease in Tc is observed, which suggests that high-pressure strain is reduced by aging.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting resonators via on-chip control of local magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators play a pivotal role in superconducting quantum circuits. The ability to fine-tune their resonant frequencies provides enhanced control and flexibility. Here, we introduce a frequency-tunable superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. By applying electrical currents through specifically designed ground wires, we achieve the generation and control of a localized magnetic field on the central line of the resonator, enabling continuous tuning of its resonant frequency. We demonstrate a frequency tuning range of 54.85 MHz in a 6.21 GHz resonator. This integrated and tunable resonator holds great potential as a dynamically tunable filter and as a key component of communication buses and memory elements in superconducting quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Integrated and DC-powered superconducting microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs, specialized laser sources emitting multiple equidistant frequency lines, have revolutionized science and technology with unprecedented precision and versatility. Recently, integrated frequency combs are emerging as scalable solutions for on-chip photonics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated superconducting microcomb that is easy to manufacture, simple to operate, and consumes ultra-low power. Our turnkey apparatus comprises a basic nonlinear superconducting device, a Josephson junction, directly coupled to a superconducting microstrip resonator. We showcase coherent comb generation through self-started mode-locking. Therefore, comb emission is initiated solely by activating a DC bias source, with power consumption as low as tens of picowatts. The resulting comb spectrum resides in the microwave domain and spans multiple octaves. The linewidths of all comb lines can be narrowed down to 1 Hz through a unique coherent injection-locking technique. Our work represents a critical step towards fully integrated microwave photonics and offers the potential for integrated quantum processors.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Space of non-Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting out the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

      <title>Exotic charge density waves and superconductivity on the Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have identified fascinating electronic orders in kagome materials, including intriguing superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) and nematicity. In particular, some experimental evidence for AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K,Rb,Cs) and related kagome metals hints at the formation of orbital currents in the charge density wave ordered regime, providing a mechanism for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in the absence of local moments. In this work, we comprehensively explore the competitive charge instabilities of the spinless kagome lattice with inter-site Coulomb interactions at the pure-sublattice van Hove filling. From the analysis of the charge susceptibility, we find that, at the nesting vectors, while the onsite charge order is dramatically suppressed, the bond charge orders are substantially enhanced owing to the sublattice texture on the hexagonal Fermi surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor bonds are characterized by significant intrinsic real and imaginary bond fluctuations, respectively. The 2$\times$2 loop current order is thus favored by the next nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion. Interestingly, increasing interactions further leads to a nematic state with intra-cell sublattice density modulation that breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We further explore superconducting orders descending from onsite and bond charge fluctuations, and discuss our model's implications on the experimental status quo.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconducting state and mirage gap in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and magnetism produces interesting phenomena in superconductors. When a two-dimensional (2D) system with strong SOI is coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor, an in-plane magnetic field can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state and induce a mirage gap at finite energies for an Ising superconductor. In this work, we demonstrate that when an $s$-wave superconductor is proximitized to an altermagnet, the intrinsic anisotropic spin splitting of the altermagnet can result in a gapless superconducting state and a pair of mirage gaps at finite energy. The gapless superconductivity exhibits spin-polarized segmented Fermi surfaces, with coexisting spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings that have a $d$-wave character. Importantly, the gapless superconducting and mirage gap features are quantified through quantum transport. Our results suggest that altermagnet is an ideal platform for studying gapless superconducting states and mirage gap physics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of high-impedance superconducting NbRe Dayem bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate superconducting Dayem-bridge weak-links made of different stoichiometric compositions of NbRe. Our devices possess a relatively high critical temperature, normal-state resistance, and kinetic inductance. In particular, the high kinetic inductance makes this material a good alternative to more conventional niobium-based superconductors (e.g., NbN or NbTiN) for the realization of superinductors and high-quality factor resonators, whereas the high normal-state resistance yields a large output voltage in superconducting switches and logic elements realized upon this compound. Moreover, out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exceeding 2 T ensure that possible applications requiring high magnetic fields can also be envisaged. Altogether, these features make this material appealing for a number of applications in the framework of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic paramagnetic response of topological Majorana surface states in the superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the superconducting gap symmetry and topological signatures in the putative spin-triplet superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$ is an important issue. Especially, a smoking-gun detection scheme for Majorana surface states hallmarking topological superconductivity in $\text{UTe}_2$ is still lacking. In this study, we examine the surface spin susceptibility of $\text{UTe}_2$ with a particular focus on the contribution of the surface states. We find that Majorana surface states contribute significantly to the surface spin susceptibility, and give rise to an Ising-like anisotropy and anomalous enhancement in the surface spin susceptibility. We calculate the surface spin susceptibility as well as the local density of states using the recursive Green's function method and examine the anisotropy of the surface spin susceptibility in terms of the topological surface states and symmetry for all irreducible representations of odd-parity pairing states. Our results indicate that the Ising anisotropy and the anomalous enhancement are attributed to the Majorana surface state protected by the crystalline symmetry. These findings suggest the possibility of detecting the Majorana surface state via magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ultraclean graphene Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>
