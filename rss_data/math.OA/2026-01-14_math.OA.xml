      <title>An Application of Idempotent Monads and Comonads to Compactifications and Unitizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses monads and comonads to establish a certain type of equivalence between two subcategories, one reflective and one coreflective, in a category whose objects represent compactifications of non-compact locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The equivalence is then examined in the dual category of unitizations of non-unital commutative $C^*$-algebras and subsequently generalized to the noncommutative case.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for embeddings of nuclear $C^*$-algebras into type II$_{1}$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a separable, unital and exact $C^*$-algebra satisfying the universal coefficient theorem. We prove uniqueness theorems up to unitary conjugacy for unital, full and nuclear maps from $A$ into ultraproducts of finite von Neumann factors: any two such maps agreeing on traces and total $K$-theory are unitarily equivalent. There are two consequences. Firstly if one takes the factors to be a sequence $(M_{k_n})_{n}$ of matrix algebras, we obtain a uniqueness result for quasidiagonal approximations of $A$. Secondly, when $(\mathcal M,\tau_{\calM})$ is a II$_1$ factor, a pair $\phi,\psi:A\to\mathcal M$ of unital, injective and nuclear maps are norm approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if $\tau_{\calM}\circ\phi=\tau_{\calM}\circ\psi$.
  The main strategy is to use Schafhauser's classification of lifts along the trace--kernel extension. Since our codomains may lack the tensorial absorption properties needed in this work, the main new ingredient is a suitable $KK$-uniqueness theorem tailored to our situation. This is inspired by $KK$-uniqueness theorems of Loreaux, Ng and Sutradhar.</description>

      <title>Algebras of distributions suitable for phase-space quantum mechanics. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The twisted product of functions on $R^{2N}$ is extended to a $*$-algebra of tempered distributions which contains the rapidly decreasing smooth functions, the distributions of compact support, and all polynomials, and moreover is invariant under the Fourier transformation. The regularity properties of the twisted product are investigated. A matrix presentation of the twisted product is given, with respect to an appropriate orthonormal basis, which is used to construct a family of Banach algebras under this product.</description>

      <title>Real $K$-Theory for $C^*$-Algebras: Just the Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is intended to present the basic properties of $KO$-theory for real $C^*$-algebras and to explain its relationship with complex $K$-theory and with $KR$- theory. Whenever possible we will rely upon proofs in printed literature, particularly the work of Karoubi, Wood, Schr\"oder, and more recent work of Boersema and J. M. Rosenberg. In addition, we shall explain how $KO$-theory is related to the Ten-Fold Way in physics and point out how some deeper features of $KO$-theory for operator algebras may provide powerful new tools there. Commutative real $C^*$-algebras not of the form $C(X, R)$ will play a special role.
  Unfortunately, there is no single reference for $KO$-theory for operator algebras that begins to compare with Blackadar's wonderful exposition of complex $K$-theory. This work is intended to provide a platform upon which mathematicians and mathematical physicists can rely in order to use these new tools in their research. As we are writing for a diverse audience of functional analysts, topologists, and physicists, we often present material well-known to one group of people and unfamiliar to another.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Perturbing and $C^*$-algebra Lifting Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate morphisms have seen significant study across many areas of mathematics, for instance, in the theory of Absolute (Neighborhood) Retracts in topology, or of almost-commuting unitary matrices in analysis. This paper initiates study of a type of approximate group action (which we call almost-actions). More precisely, these are sequences of set maps from a group into the homeomorphisms of a compact metric space which are asymptotically multiplicative in the sense of the metric. We prove a kind of topological stability holds in certain cases, such as when the group is finite and the space is a Cantor set, so that one can find genuine actions near the almost-actions, and apply these results to produce new finite approximations of many actions by virtually free groups on Cantor sets. We also introduce a new type of lifting problem for $C^*$-algebras which, rather than asking for a lift of a homomorphism, asks for a lift of the structure of a Cartan pair, and use this new notion to characterize the stability of more general almost-actions. In the course of attempting to apply the theory of semiprojective $C^*$-algebras to these questions, we define a notion of conditional semiprojectivity for morphisms of $C^*$-algebras. We show that maps of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras are conditionally semiprojective, but that the inclusion of $C(S^1)$ into $C(S^1)\rtimes \Gamma$ (for any non-trivial action of a finite group $\Gamma$) is not. We conclude with a conjecture about the general stability of almost-actions by finite groups and some commentary on possible directions for further developing these ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph $R$, we construct from it two graphs $E_R$ and $F_R$, one by adding a loop at every vertex of $R$ and one by replacing every arrow of $R$ by countably infinitely many arrows. We show that the graph C*-algebra $C^*(F_R)$ is isomorphic to the AF core of $C^*(E_R)$. Examples include C*-algebras of a quantum flag manifolds and quantum teardrops. We discuss in detail the quantum Grassmannian $Gr_q(2,4)$ and use our description as AF core to study its CW-structure.</description>

      <title>On masas of the Calkin algebra generated by projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the continuum hypothesis CH, we obtain complete $*$-isomorphic classification of maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebras (masas) of the Calkin algebra $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ (bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space modulo compact operators) generated by projections. In particular, for any compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $K$ of weight not exceeding the continuum and not admitting $G_\delta$ points we construct under CH a masa of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ which is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra $C(K)$ of complex-valued continuous functions on $K$.
  This, among others, shows that masas of the Calkin algebra could have rather unexpected properties compared to the previously known three $*$-isomorphic types of them generated by projections: $\ell_\infty/c_0$, $L_\infty$ and $\ell_\infty/c_0\oplus L_\infty$.
  It can be shown that some additional set-theoretic hypothesis, like CH, is necessary for such results. However, without making any additional set-theoretic assumptions we still construct a family of maximal possible cardinality (of the power set of $\mathbb R$) of pairwise non-$*$-isomorphic masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections and with properties unlike the three above examples.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qudit Quantum Processors: stabilizer states, stabilizer codes, symplectic operations, and non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.
  Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</description>
