      <title>Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Applied to Steady Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine learning method to predict steady external fluid flows using elliptic input features is introduced. Using data from as few as one high-fidelity simulation, the proposed method produces models generalizable under changes to boundary geometry by using solutions to elliptic boundary value problems over the flow domain as the model input, instead of Cartesian coordinates of the domain. Training data is generated through pointwise evaluation of flow features at points selected through a quad-tree adaptive sampling method to concentrate training points in areas with large field gradients. Models are trained within a training window around the body, while predictions are smoothly extended to freestream conditions using a Partition-of-Unity extension. Predictive capabilities of the machine learning model are demonstrated in steady-state flow of incompressible fluid around a cylinder and a Joukowski airfoil. The predicted flow field is used to warm-start CFD simulations to achieve acceleration in solver convergence.</description>

      <title>Effects of rough walls on sheared annular centrifugal Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the coupling effects of roughness and wall shear in an annular centrifugal Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (ACRBC) system, where two cylinders rotate with different angular velocities. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are conducted within a Rayleigh number range of $10^{6} \leq Ra \leq 10^{8}$, and the non-dimensional angular velocity difference ($\varOmega$), representing wall shear, varied from 0 to 1. The Prandtl number is fixed at $Pr = 4.3$, the inverse Rossby number at $Ro^{-1} = 20$, and the radius ratio at $\eta = 0.5$. The interaction between wall shear and roughness leads to distinct heat transfer behavior in different regimes. In the buoyancy-dominant regime, an increase in the non-dimensional angular velocity difference ($\varOmega$) significantly enhances heat transfer. However, as $\varOmega$ continues to rise, a sharp reduction in heat transfer is observed in the transitional regime. Beyond a critical value of $\varOmega$, the flow enters a shear-dominant regime, where heat transfer remains unchanged despite further increases in $\varOmega$.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modulation in particle-laden channel flow: the particle inertial effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle inertial effects on turbulence modulation in particle-laden channel flow are investigated through four-way coupled point-particle direct numerical simulations, with the mass loading fixed at $0.6$ and friction Stokes number $St^+$ varying from $3$ to $300$. A full transition pathway is realized in sequence from a drag-enhanced to a drag-reduced flow regime, before asymptotically approaching the single-phase state as $St^+$ increases continuously up to 300. For the first time, a set of transport equations for the particle phase is derived analytically to interpret the inter-phase coupling, in the context of the point-based statistical description of particle-laden turbulence. By virtue of this, two dominant mechanisms are substantially identified and quantified: a positive, particle-induced extra transport, which decreases monotonically with $St^+$, and a negative, particle-induced extra dissipation, which depends non-monotonically on $St^+$. The coupling of these two mechanisms leads to a direct contribution of particle phase to the shear stress balance, turbulent kinetic energy, and Reynolds stress budgets. As a consequence, with the increase of particle inertia, the self-sustaining cycle of near-wall turbulence transitions from being augmented to being suppressed and, eventually, recovers to the single-phase situation. This gives rise to an indirect effect, manifested by the non-monotonic modification of Reynolds shear stress and turbulent production rate. Taken together, comprehensive interplays between particle-modified turbulent transport, particle-induced extra transport and dissipation are analyzed and summarized, providing a holistic physical picture composed of consistent interpretations of turbulence modulation.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Hydrodynamic Characterization of the Flow Through Regular and Stochastically Generated Synthetic Coral Reefs Over Flat Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coral reefs are vital to marine ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and driving nutrient cycling. Despite significant research on the interaction between surface waves and natural or artificial reefs, the turbulent flow dynamics within coral canopies remain poorly understood due to their intricate geometries. This study addresses this knowledge gap using a turbulence-resolving computation-al framework based on the volume-penalizing immersed boundary method (vIBM). Comparing the serial, staggered, and stochastic arrangements of various coral roughness types we observe that massive corals and cylinders lead to a similar hydrodynamics response and the effect of dispersive stresses can introduce a large difference when stochastic coral reefs are considered. These observations highlight the importance of better understanding the hydrodynamics of complex coral reef geometries, emphasizing the need for further studies on this aspect of coral reef hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The spectral dynamics and spatial structures of the conditional Lyapunov vector in slave Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct direct numerical simulations to investigate the synchronization of Kolmogorov flows in a periodic box, with a focus on the mechanisms underlying the asymptotic evolution of infinitesimal velocity perturbations, also known as conditional leading Lyapunov vectors. This study advances previous work with a spectral analysis of the perturbation, which clarifies the behaviours of the production and dissipation spectra at different coupling wavenumbers. We show that, in simulations with moderate Reynolds numbers, the conditional leading Lyapunov exponent can be smaller than a lower bound proposed previously based on a viscous estimate. A quantitative analysis of the self-similar evolution of the perturbation energy spectrum is presented, extending the existing qualitative discussion. The prerequisites for obtaining self-similar solutions are established, which include an interesting relationship between the integral length scale of the perturbation velocity and the local Lyapunov exponent. By examining the governing equation for the dissipation rate of the velocity perturbation, we reveal the previously neglected roles of the strain rate and vorticity perturbations and uncover their unique geometrical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Solving Turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection using Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate models for Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC), a model for convection processes that occur in nature and industrial settings. We compare the prediction accuracy and model properties of FNO surrogates to two popular surrogates used in fluid dynamics: the Dynamic Mode Decomposition and the Linearly-Recurrent Autoencoder Network. We regard Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the RBC equations as the ground truth on which the models are trained and evaluated in different settings. The FNO performs favorably when compared to the DMD and LRAN and its predictions are fast and highly accurate for this task. Additionally, we show its zero-shot super-resolution ability for the convection dynamics. The FNO model has a high potential to be used in downstream tasks such as flow control in RBC.</description>

      <title>General average balance equations and buoyancy closure for a mixture of a continuous fluid and rigid particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of motion of a continuous fluid and rigid, non-Brownian particles that interact through contacts are averaged to derive average balance equations. The averaging procedure is generic, requiring only linearity and commutation with the space and time derivatives. No assumptions about the fluid's rheology and the particles' shapes and compositions are made. We obtain mathematically exact micromechanical expressions for the fluid phase, solid phase, and mixture fields of interest. We demonstrate for a specific example, numerical simulations of sediment transport, based on Direct Numerical Simulations and the Discrete Element Method, that they can be conveniently extracted from such particle-resolved simulations without the need of approximations. In contrast, fields extracted using previous formalisms based on first-order Taylor expansions in the ratio between the particle size and the macroscopic flow scale are in clear disagreement with the exact ones due to a lack of scale separation. This study therefore lays the groundwork for numerically studying the rheology of particulate two-phase flows in systems without scale separation. We also use the simulations to test existing buoyancy closures, that is, decompositions of the fluid-solid interaction force density into a generalized-drag force density and a generalized-buoyancy force density. We find that only one existing closure is consistent with the simulation data and existing experiments. However, it leads to a contradictory fluid momentum balance for certain stationary fluid-particle systems. We resolve this contradiction through a physically-motivated improvement. Compared with the original closure, the improved closure tends to suppress buoyancy for short-wavelength perturbations of homogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Generalization capabilities and robustness of hybrid machine learning models grounded in flow physics compared to purely deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the generalization capabilities and robustness of purely deep learning (DL) models and hybrid models based on physical principles in fluid dynamics applications, specifically focusing on iteratively forecasting the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. Three autoregressive models were compared: a hybrid model (POD-DL) that combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a long-short term memory (LSTM) layer, a convolutional autoencoder combined with a convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) layer and a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with a ConvLSTM layer. These models were tested on two high-dimensional, nonlinear datasets representing the velocity field of flow past a circular cylinder in both laminar and turbulent regimes. The study used latent dimension methods, enabling a bijective reduction of high-dimensional dynamics into a lower-order space to facilitate future predictions. While the VAE and ConvLSTM models accurately predicted laminar flow, the hybrid POD-DL model outperformed the others across both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. This success is attributed to the model's ability to incorporate modal decomposition, reducing the dimensionality of the data, by a non-parametric method, and simplifying the forecasting component. By leveraging POD, the model not only gained insight into the underlying physics, improving prediction accuracy with less training data, but also reduce the number of trainable parameters as POD is non-parametric. The findings emphasize the potential of hybrid models, particularly those integrating modal decomposition and deep learning, in predicting complex flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of the laminar flow past rectangular prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laminar flow past rectangular prisms is studied in the space of length-to-height ratio ($1 \le L/H \le 5$), width-to-height ratio ($1.2 \le W/H \le 5$) and Reynolds number ($Re \lessapprox 700$). The primary bifurcation is investigated with linear stability analysis. For large $W/L$ it consists of an oscillating mode breaking the top/bottom planar symmetry. For smaller $W/L$ the flow becomes first unstable to stationary perturbations, and the wake experiences a static deflection, vertical for intermediate $W/L$ and horizontal for small $W/L$. Weakly nonlinear analysis and nonlinear direct numerical simulations are used for $L/H = 5$ and larger $Re$. For $W/H = 1.2$ and $2.25$, after the primary bifurcation the flow recovers the top/bottom planar symmetry but loses the left/right one, via supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations, respectively. Further increasing $Re$, the flow becomes unsteady and oscillates around either the deflected (small $W/H$) or the non-deflected (intermediate $W/H$) wake. For intermediate $W/H$ and $R$e, a periodic and fully symmetric regime is detected, with hairpin vortices shed from the top and bottom leading-edge (LE) shear layers; its triggering mechanism is discussed. At large $Re$ and for all $W/H$, the flow approaches a chaotic state characterised by the superposition of different modes: shedding of hairpin vortices from the LE shear layers, and wake oscillations in the horizontal and vertical directions. In some portions of the parameter space the different modes synchronise, giving rise to periodic regimes also at relatively large $Re$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic relationship between synchronisation thresholds and Lyapunov vectors: evidence from large eddy simulations and shell models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important parameter characterising the synchronisation of turbulent flows is the threshold coupling wavenumber. This study investigates the relationship between the threshold coupling wavenumber and the leading Lyapunov vector using large eddy simulations and the SABRA model. Various subgrid-scale stress models, Reynolds numbers, and different coupling methods are examined. A new scaling relation is identified for the leading Lyapunov exponents in large eddy simulations, showing that they approximate those of filtered direct numerical simulations. This interpretation provides a physical basis for results related to the Lyapunov exponents of large eddy simulations, including those related to synchronisation. Synchronization experiments show that the peak wavenumber of the energy spectrum of the leading Lyapunov vector coincides with the threshold coupling wavenumber, in large eddy simulations of box turbulence with standard Smagorinsky or dynamic mixed models as well as in the SABRA model, replicating results from direct numerical simulations of box turbulence. Although the dynamic Smagorinsky model exhibit different behaviour, the totality of the results suggests that the relationship is an intrinsic property of a certain class of chaotic systems. We also confirm that conditional Lyapunov exponents characterize the synchronization process in indirectly coupled systems as they do in directly coupled ones, with their values insensitive to the nature of the master flow. These findings advance the understanding of the role of the Lyapunov vector in the synchronization of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard convective motion of stratified fluids in the Earth's troposphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kaladze and Misra [Phys. Scr. 99 (2024) 085013] showed that the tropospheric stratified fluid flows may be unstable by the effects of the negative temperature gradient and the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity arising from the thermal expansion. They also predicted that the modification in the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency by the density inhomogeneity can lead to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability in the tropospheric unbounded layers. The purpose of the present work is to revisit the Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability in more detail by considering both unbounded and bounded tropospheric layers. Starting from a set of fluid equations for incompressible neutral fluids with temperature gradients and using the Boussinesq approximation, we derive the general dispersion relations for Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective waves in unbounded and bounded tropospheric domains and analyze them with some particular cases both analytically and numerically. We show that the conditions for instability in these two cases significantly differ. Furthermore, we obtain and analyze the critical values of the Raleigh numbers and the expressions for the instability growth rates of thermal waves in the two cases. In the case of the bounded region, we also derive the necessary boundary conditions and note that the vertical wave number is quantified, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is well-set.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>

Abstract: Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are textured hydrophobic surfaces which have the ability to trap air pockets when immersed in water. This can result in significant drag reduction, due to substantially lower viscosity of air resulting in substantial effective slip velocity at the interface. Past studies of both laminar and turbulent flows model this slip velocity in terms of a homogenized Navier slip boundary condition with a slip length relating the wall slip velocity to the wall-normal velocity gradient. In this work, we seek to understand the effects of superhydrophobic surfaces in the context of mean scalar and momentum mixing. We use the macroscopic forcing method (Mani and Park, 2021) to compute the generalized eddy viscosity and slip length operators of a turbulent channel over SHS, implemented as both a pattern-resolved boundary condition and homogenized slip length boundary condition, for several pattern sizes and geometries. We present key differences in the mixing behavior of both boundary conditions through quantification of their near-wall eddy viscosity. Analysis of transport in turbulent flow over pattern-resolved surfaces reveals substantial nonlocality in the measured homogenized slip length for both scalar and momentum mixing when the Reynolds and Peclet numbers based on pattern size are finite. We present several metrics to quantify this nonlocality and observe possible trends relating to Reynolds number, texture size, and pattern geometry. The importance of nonlocality in the slip length operator and in the eddy diffusivity operator is demonstrated by examining the impact on Reynolds-averaged solutions for the mean scalar and velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Modeling drop deformations and rheology of dilute to dense emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>
