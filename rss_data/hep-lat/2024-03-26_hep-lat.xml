      <title>The crossover line in the $(T, \mu)$-phase diagram of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient way to study the QCD phase diagram at small finite density is to extrapolate thermodynamical observables from imaginary chemical potential. The phase diagram features a crossover line starting from the transition temperature already determined at zero chemical potential. In this work we focus on the Taylor expansion of this line up to $\mu^4$ contributions. We present the continuum extrapolation of the crossover temperature based on different observables at several lattice spacings.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. The anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity with the dressing factor shows that, when the symmetry operator sweep out a 't~Hooft loop, the loop acquires a surface operator of the $U(1)$ field strength with a correction of a higher cup product. This result appears consistent with the phenomenon observed in the continuum theory. A similar analysis for the axion string operator shows that it is not affected by the symmetry operator.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moments of Hidden-Bottom Pentaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systematically magnetic moments of hiddden-bottom pentaquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{\pm}$, $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$, and $J^P=\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ with molecular, diquark-diquark-antiquark, and diquark-triquark models. The numerical results show that magnetic moments are different within the same model according to same quantum numbers and spin-orbit couplings. The results are also different when different models are taken into account with the same angular momentum. The magnetic moments encode valuable information about inner structures. We believe that our results may be helpful for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent transition separating confinement and Higgs phases in lattice SU(2) gauge theory with a scalar field in the fundamental representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13430v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the preceding studies, the lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with a single scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group has a single confinement-Higgs phase where confinement and Higgs regions are subregions of an analytically continued single phase and there are no thermodynamic phase transitions, which is a well-known consequence of the Osterwalder-Seiler-Fradkin-Shenker theorem. In this paper, we show that we can define new types of gauge-invariant operators by combining the original fundamental scalar field and the so-called color-direction field which is obtained by change of field variables based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi. By performing the numerical simulations on the lattice without any gauge fixing, we reproduce the conventional thermodynamic transition line in the weak gauge coupling, and moreover we find a new transition line detected by the new gauge-invariant operators which separates the confinement-Higgs phase into two parts, confinement phase and the Higgs phase, in the strong gauge coupling. All results are obtained in the gauge-independent way, since no gauge fixing has been imposed in the numerical simulations. Moreover, we discuss a physical interpretation for the new transition from the viewpoint of the realization of a global symmetry.</description>

      <title>Towards $\it{ab}$-$\it{initio}$ nuclear theory calculations of $\delta_\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory framework to study the isospin-symmetry breaking correction $\delta_\text{C}$ in superallowed nuclear beta decays, crucial for the precise determination of $|V_{ud}|$. Based on a general assumptions of the isovector dominance in ISB interactions, we construct a set of functions $F_{T_z}$ which involve nuclear matrix elements of isovector monopole operators and the nuclear Green's function. Via the functions $F_{T_z}$, a connection of $\delta_\text{C}$ to measurable electroweak nuclear radii is established, providing an experimental gauge of the theory accuracy of $\delta_\text{C}$. We outline a strategy to perform ab-initio calculations of $F_{T_z}$ based on the Lanczos algorithm, and discuss its similarity with other nuclear-structure-dependent inputs in nuclear beta decays.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality lost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Updates on the determination of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$, $R(D^{*})$ and $\vert V_{ub} \vert/\vert V_{cb} \vert$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated determination of the values of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$, $R(D^*)$ and $\vert V_{ub} \vert/\vert V_{cb} \vert$ based on the new data on semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays by the Belle and Belle-II Collaborations and on the recent theoretical progress in the calculation of the form factors relevant for semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ and $B_s \to K \ell \nu_\ell$ decays. In particular we present results derived by applying either the Dispersive Matrix (DM) method of Refs. [1-6] or the more standard Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) [7] approach to the most recent values of the form factors determined in lattice QCD. Using all the available lattice results for the form factors from the DM method we get the theoretical value $R^{\rm th}(D^*) = 0.262 \pm 0.009$ and we extract from a bin-per-bin analysis of the experimental data the value $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (39.92 \pm 0.64) \cdot10^{-3}$. Our result for $R(D^*)$ is consistent with the latest experimental world average $R^{\rm exp}(D^*) = 0.284 \pm 0.012$ [8]} at the $\simeq 1.5\,\sigma$ level. Our value for $\vert V_{cb} \vert$ is compatible with the latest inclusive determinations $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} = (41.97 \pm 0.48) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [9] and $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} = (41.69\pm 0.63) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [10] within $\simeq 2.6$ and $\simeq 2.0$ standard deviations, respectively. From a reappraisal of the calculations of $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert$, we also obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.087\pm 0.009$ in good agreement with the result $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.0844\pm 0.0056$ from the latest FLAG review [11].</description>

      <title>Effective String Theories (EST) of Yang-Mills Flux Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter explains the concept of \emph{Effective String Theories}(EST), and their success in explaining the results that Yang-Mills flux tubes behave, to a high degree of accuracy, like Bosonic Strings(BST). It describes EST's of L\"uscher and Weisz, and their principal conclusions. It then discusses the Polchinski-Strominger EST's. which are valid in all dimensions. It then describes the works by Drummond, and, the author and Peter Matlock, which extended the analysis to $R^{-3}$ order and showed, that even at that order the spectrum is that of BST. The chapter analyses the issues of string momentum in higher orders. It discusses at length the powerful covariant calculus, to systematically construct EST's to arbitrary orders. The most general actions to $R^{-7}$ order are shown to be governed by just two parameters. The works of Aharony and collaborators on the spectrum of EST's, both in static and conformal gauges,to $R^{-5}$ order, and their results that even at that order the ground state energy remains the same as that of BST, but the excited spectrum gets corrected for $D\,&gt;\,3$, are explained. It discusses the simulation results for excited states. It also discusses the AdS-CFT approaches and thickness of flux tubes.Recent works by Ambjorn, Makeenko, and Sedrakyan on the path-integral approaches to this issue are also discussed and compared with the other approaches. It concludes with remarks on the significance of the results for QCD.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
