      <title>Exploring the Dyson Ring: Parameters, Stability and Helical Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dyson ring is a hypothetical megastructure, that a very advanced civilization would build around a star to harness more of its energy. Satellite propagation is of high priority in such a vast world where distances could very well be measured in astronomical units. We analyze the ring's parameters and stability and propose a stable helical orbit around the Dyson ring influenced by the gravity of the Dyson ring and the Sun. Taking theoretically explainable values for all parameters, we describe our approach to finding this orbit and present the successful simulation of a satellite's flight in this path.</description>

      <title>Outstanding questions and future research of magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short article highlights the unsolved problems of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma. The advanced in-situ plasma measurements and simulations enabled scientists to gain a novel understanding of magnetic reconnection. Still, outstanding questions remain on the complex dynamics and structures in the diffusion region, on the cross-scale and regional couplings, on the onset of magnetic reconnection, and on the details of energetics. Future directions of the magnetic reconnection research in terms of new observations, new simulations and interdisciplinary approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvenic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a classification scheme for solar wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters Four to Fourteen to study the sources of the slow Alfvenic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from small coronal holes (CHs) and their over-expanded boundaries, while a second population seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This CH-like SASW shows larger expansion than the FSW, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point leading to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that SASW emerging from CH-like structures shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the SASW emerging from non-CH structures, and that this is a velocity dependent phenomena as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multi-point observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.</description>

      <title>Quenching of Tearing Mode Instability by Transverse Magnetic Fields in Reconnection Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tearing mode instability is a key process for magnetic energy conversion in magnetohydrodynamics, once anti-parallel components are allowed to reconnect, leading to the formation of magnetic islands. It has been employed to explain phenomena at different scales in nature, from galactic nuclei, to solar flares and laboratory fusion devices. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of a current sheet in the presence of a transverse magnetic field component, in the framework of viscoresistive, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), both analytically and by means of direct numerical simulations. Firstly, we obtain analytical solution for the time-varying one-dimensional profile of an initial Harris current sheet in the presence of a transverse field. We find that the introduction of a transverse magnetic field disrupts the system's equilibrium, leading to the natural development of a neutral layer with shear flows within the current sheet, one along the antiparallel magnetic component and another along the guide field direction. Secondly, through numerical analysis, we examine the dispersion relation of the incompressible MHD equations in the context of a modified equilibrium profile due to the transverse field. Our findings indicate a rapid suppression of unstable modes of tearing instability with the width of the neutral layer, confirming the analytical predictions. These results offer new insightful understanding on the interplay between transverse magnetic fields, shear flows, and tearing mode instabilities in current sheet environments.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the helicity barrier from measurements of the turbulence transition range in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The means by which the turbulent cascade of energy is dissipated in the solar wind, and in other astrophysical systems, is a major open question. It has recently been proposed that a barrier to the transfer of energy can develop at small scales, which can enable heating through ion-cyclotron resonance, under conditions applicable to regions of the solar wind. Such a scenario fundamentally diverges from the standard picture of turbulence, where the energy cascade proceeds unimpeded until it is dissipated. Here, using data from NASA's Parker Solar Probe, we find that the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum around the ion gyroradius varies with solar wind parameters in a manner consistent with the presence of such a barrier. This allows us to identify critical values of some of the parameters necessary for the barrier to form; we show that the barrier appears fully developed for ion plasma beta of below $\simeq0.5$ and becomes increasingly prominent with imbalance for normalised cross helicity values greater than $\simeq0.4$. As these conditions are frequently met in the solar wind, particularly close to the Sun, our results suggest that the barrier is likely playing a significant role in turbulent dissipation in the solar wind and so is an important mechanism in explaining its heating and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Proton and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of non-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor at Mars with Uncertainty Quantification using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single spacecraft missions do not measure the pristine solar wind continuously because of the spacecrafts' orbital trajectory. The infrequent spatiotemporal cadence of measurement fundamentally limits conclusions about solar wind-magnetosphere coupling throughout the solar system. At Mars, such single spacecraft missions result in limitations for assessing the solar wind's role in causing lower altitude observations such as auroral dynamics or atmospheric loss. In this work, we detail the development of a virtual solar wind monitor from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission; a single spacecraft. This virtual solar wind monitor provides a continuous estimate of the solar wind upstream from Mars with uncertainties. We specifically employ Gaussian process regression to estimate the upstream solar wind and uncertainty estimations that scale with the data sparsity of our real observations. This proxy enables continuous solar wind estimation at Mars with representative uncertainties for the majority of the time since since late 2014. We conclude by discussing suggested uses of this virtual solar wind monitor for statistical studies of the Mars space environment and heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>
