      <title>Pipelining Kruskal's: A Neuromorphic Approach for Minimum Spanning Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10771v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, characterized by its event-driven computation and massive parallelism, is particularly effective for handling data-intensive tasks in low-power environments, such as computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) for large-scale graphs. The introduction of dynamic synaptic modifications provides new design opportunities for neuromorphic algorithms. Building on this foundation, we propose an SNN-based union-sort routine and a pipelined version of Kruskal's algorithm for MST computation. The event-driven nature of our method allows for the concurrent execution of two completely decoupled stages: neuromorphic sorting and union-find. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art Prim 's-based methods on large-scale graphs from the DIMACS10 dataset, achieving speedups by 269.67x to 1283.80x, with a median speedup of 540.76x. We further evaluate the pipelined implementation against two serial variants of Kruskal's algorithm, which rely on neuromorphic sorting and neuromorphic radix sort, showing significant performance advantages in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Concept of a System-on-Chip Research Platform Benchmarking Interaction of Memristor-based Bio-inspired Computing Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system architecture is suggested for a System on Chip that will combine several different memristor-based, bio-inspired computation arrays with inter- and intra-chip communication. It will serve as a benchmark system for future developments. The architecture takes the special requirements into account which are caused by the memristor co-integration on commercial CMOS structures in a post processing step of the chip. The interface considers the necessary data bandwidth to monitor the internal Network on Chip at speed and provides enough flexibility to give different measurement options.</description>

      <title>ForgetMeNot: Understanding and Modeling the Impact of Forever Chemicals Toward Sustainable Large-Scale Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorinated compounds, often referred to as forever chemicals, are critical in various steps of semiconductor fabrication like lithography, etching, chamber cleaning, and others. Forever chemical emissions can exhibit global warming potentials thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide and persist in the atmosphere for millennia. Despite their severe impact, most sustainability works in computer systems have focused on carbon emissions alone. We address this gap by introducing ForgetMeNot, a modeling tool that quantifies fluorinated compound emissions by integrating fabrication facility-specific practices and hardware specifications, and validate its accuracy using real-world emission data from fabrication facilities. We show how ForgetMeNot can enable fabrication facilities to optimize design and material usage decisions for emission reduction and provide researchers with a methodology to calibrate emission estimates for hardware designs. When ForgetMeNot is applied to analyze emissions for manufacturing CPUs, DRAM, and storage, it illustrates how hardware generations, lithography techniques, and capacities impact fluorinated compound emissions. Finally, we demonstrate how datacenter operators can assemble low-emission servers while balancing performance demands. By factoring in fluorinated emissions into manufacturing decisions, ForgetMeNot paves the way for building more sustainable systems.</description>

      <title>GLOVA: Global and Local Variation-Aware Analog Circuit Design with Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design encounters significant challenges due to performance degradation from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods, including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.</description>

      <title>Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>
