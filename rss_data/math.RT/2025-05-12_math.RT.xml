      <title>Representation gaps of rigid planar diagram monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define non-pivotal analogs of the Temperley-Lieb, Motzkin, and planar rook monoids, and compute bounds for the sizes of their nontrivial simple representations. From this, we assess the two types of monoids in their relative suitability for use in cryptography by comparing their representation gaps and gap ratios. We conclude that the non-pivotal monoids are generally worse for cryptographic purposes.</description>

      <title>Tensor modules over the Lie algebras of divergence zero vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer, $S_n$ be the Lie algebra of vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^n$ with zero divergence, and $D_n$ be the Weyl algebra over the polynomial algebra $A_n=\mathbb{C}[t_1,t_2,\cdots,t_n]$. In this paper, we study the simplicity of the tensor $S_n$-module $F(P,M)$, where $P$ is a simple $D_n$-module and $M$ is a simple $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-module. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for $F(P,M)$ to be an irreducible module, and determine all simple subquotients of $F(P,M)$ when it is reducible.</description>

      <title>A categorification of combinatorial Auslander-Reiten quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a categorification of Oh and Suh's combinatorial Auslander-Reiten quivers in the simply laced case. We work within the perfectly valued derived category $\mathrm{pvd}(\Pi_Q)$ of the 2-dimensional Ginzburg dg algebra of a Dynkin quiver $Q$. For any commutation class $[i]$ of reduced words in the corresponding Weyl group, we define a subcategory $C([i])$ of $\mathrm{pvd}(\Pi_Q)$ whose objects are obtained by applying a sequence of spherical twist functors to the simple objects. We describe the Hom-order for $C([i])$ in terms of $[i]$, generalizing a result of B\'edard. Furthermore, when $[i]$ is a commutation class for the longest element, we construct a category $D([i])$ generalizing the bounded derived category of $Q$. It is realized as a certain subquotient of $\mathrm{pvd}(\Pi_Q)$. We demonstrate the existence of particular distinguished triangles in $\mathrm{pvd}(\Pi_Q)$ with corners in $D([i])$, which allows us to extend the classical mesh-additivity to arbitrary commutation classes. Additionally, we define an analog of the Euler form and prove that its symmetrization yields the corresponding Cartan-Killing form. For commutation classes $[i]$ arising from Q-data, a generalization of Dynkin quivers with a height function introduced by Fujita and Oh, we establish the existence of a partially Serre functor on $D([i])$. Lastly, we apply our results to reinterpret a formula by Fujita and Oh for the inverse of the quantum Cartan matrix.</description>

      <title>Representation of tensor functions using low-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of DHKK complexities for singularity categories and generation of syzygy modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative noetherian ring. In this paper, we study, for the singularity category of R, the vanishing of the complexity $\delta_t(X,Y)$ in the sense of Dimitrov, Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich. We prove that the set of real numbers t such that $\delta_t(X,Y)$ does not vanish is bounded in various cases. We do it by building the high syzygy modules and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules out of a single module only by taking direct summands and extensions.</description>

      <title>Extension-closed subcategories over hypersurfaces of finite or countable CM-representation type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let k be an algebraically closed uncountable field of characteristic zero. Let R be a complete local hypersurface over k. Denote by CM(R) the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules and by D^{sg}(R) the singularity category of R. Denote by CM_0(R) the full category of CM(R) consisting of modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum of R, and by D^{sg}_0(R) the full subcategory of D^{sg}(R) consisting of objects that are locally zero on the punctured spectrum of R. In this paper, under the assumption that R has finite or countable CM-representation type, we completely classify the extension-closed subcategories of CM_0(R) in dimension at most two, and the extension-closed subcategories of D^{sg}_0(R) in arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <title>Two stability theorems on plethysms of Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composition of polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups. Finding the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda\rangle$ that express an arbitrary plethysm $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$ as a sum $\sum_\lambda \langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda \rangle s_\lambda$ of Schur functions is a fundamental open problem in algebraic combinatorics. We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $\mu$ or $\nu$. In both theorems $\mu$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on plethysms of Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries.</description>

      <title>Biserial algebras and generic bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generic bricks and use them in the study of arbitrary biserial algebras over algebraically closed fields. For a biserial algebra $\Lambda$, we show that $\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if it admits a generic brick, that is, there exists a generic $\Lambda$-module $G$ with $End_{\Lambda}(G)=k(x)$. Furthermore, we give an explicit numerical condition for brick-infiniteness of biserial algebras: If $\Lambda$ is of rank $n$, then $\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if there exists an infinite family of bricks of length $d$, for some $2\leq d\leq 2n$. This also results in an algebro-geometric realization of $\tau$-tilting finiteness of this family: $\Lambda$ is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if $\Lambda$ is brick-discrete, meaning that in every representation variety $mod(\Lambda, \underline{d})$, there are only finitely many orbits of bricks.
  Our results rely on our full classification of minimal brick-infinite biserial algebras in terms of quivers and relations. This is the modern analogue of the recent classification of minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebras, given by Ringel. In particular, we show that every minimal brick-infinite biserial algebra is gentle and admits exactly one generic brick. Furthermore, we describe the spectrum of such algebras, which is very similar to that of a tame hereditary algebra. In other words, $Brick(\Lambda)$ is the disjoint union of a unique generic brick with a countable infinite set of bricks of finite length, and a family of bricks of the same finite length parametrized by the ground field.</description>

Abstract: We prove that all wild blocks of type $A$ Hecke algebras with quantum characteristic $e \geqslant 3$ -- i.e. blocks of weight at least $2$ -- are strictly wild, with the possible exception of the weight $2$ Rouquier block for $e = 3$. As a corollary, we show that for $e \geqslant 3$, all wild blocks of the $q$-Schur algebras are strictly wild, without exception.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of the parabolic induction of essentially Speh representations and a representation of Arthur type over a p-adic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field. In this article, we consider representations of split special orthogonal groups $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(F)$ and symplectic groups $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ of rank $n$. We denote by $\pi_1 \times \ldots \times \pi_r \rtimes \pi$ the normalized parabolically induced representation of either. Now let $u_i$ be essentially Speh representations and $\pi$ a representation of Arthur type. We prove that the parabolic induction $u_1 \times \ldots \times u_r \rtimes \pi$ is irreducible if and only if $u_i \times u_j$, $u_i \times u_j^\vee$ and $u_i \rtimes \pi$ are irreducible for all choices of $i\neq j$. If $u_i$ are Speh representations, we determine the composition series of the above parabolically induced representation. Through this, we are able to produce a new collection of unitary representations.</description>

      <title>On integral decomposition of unipotent elements in integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jespers and Sun conjectured that if a finite group $G$ has the property ND, i.e. for every nilpotent element $n$ in the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ and every primitive central idempotent $e \in \mathbb{Q}G$ one still has $ne \in \mathbb{Z}G$, then at most one of the simple components of the group algebra $\mathbb{Q} G$ has reduced degree bigger than $1$. With the exception of one very special series of groups we are able to answer their conjecture, showing that it is true - up to exactly one exception. To do so we first describe groups with the so-called SN property which was introduced by Liu and Passman in their investigation of the Multiplicative Jordan Decomposition for integral group rings.
  We then study further objects connected to the property ND. This concerns on one hand a certain section of the unit group of $\mathbb{Z} G$ which measures how far $G$ is from having ND and about which Jespers and Sun posed two further questions which we answer. On the other hand we introduce two properties which appeared naturally in these investigations: one is purely representation-theoretic, while the other can be regarded as indicating that it might be hard to decide ND. Among others we show these two notions are equivalent for groups with SN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parabolic double cosets in a Coxeter system by decomposing them into atom(ic coset)s, a generalization of simple reflections introduced in a joint work with Elias, Libedinsky, Patimo. We define and classify braid relations between compositions of atoms and prove a Matsumoto theorem. Together with a quadratic relation, our braid relations give a presentation of nilCoxeter algebroids similar to Demazure's presentation of nilCoxeter algebras. Our consideration of reduced compositions of atoms gives rise to a new combinatorial structure, which is equipped with a length function and a Bruhat order and is realized as Tits cone intersections in the sense of Iyama-Wemyss.</description>
