      <title>Stochastic dynamics on evolving geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite locally finite system (configuration) $\gamma$ of particles distributed over a Euclidean space $X$. Each particle located at $x\in X$ carries an internal parameter (mark, or ``spin'') $\sigma_{x}\in S=\mathbb{R}.$ Such collections of particles form the space of marked configurations $\Gamma(X,S)$. We construct the following stochastic dynamics in $\Gamma(X,S)$: while the configuration $\gamma$ of particle positions performs a random evolution, the corresponding marks interact with each other and perform a coupled infinite-dimensional diffusion. The study of a spin dynamics on a fixed configuration $\gamma$ was initiated by Daletskii and Finkelshtein, J. Stat. Phys. 122 ( 2018), and continued by Chargaziya and Daletskii, J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025), and is based on the generalisation of the Ovsjannikov method. In the present paper, the underlying configuration evolves according to a Birth-and-Death process. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such dynamics and show that it forms a c\`adl\`ag process in $\Gamma(X,S)$.</description>

      <title>Stein's method, Markov processes, and linear eigenvalue statistics of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the infinitesimal exchangeable pairs approach to Stein's method combines naturally with the theory of Markov semigroups. We present a multivariate normal approximation theorem for functions of a random variable invariant with respect to a Markov semigroup. This theorem provides a Wasserstein distance bound in terms of quantities related to the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup. As an application, we deduce a rate of convergence for Johansson's celebrated theorem on linear eigenvalue statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Bounds for Random Matrices via Zerofreeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new technique to prove bounds for the spectral radius of a random matrix, based on using Jensen's formula to establish the zerofreeness of the associated characteristic polynomial in a region of the complex plane. Our techniques are entirely non-asymptotic, and we instantiate it in three settings:
  (i) The spectral radius of non-asymptotic Girko matrices -- these are asymmetric matrices $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ whose entries are independent and satisfy $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{M}_{ij} = 0$ and $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^2| \le \frac{1}{n}$.
  (ii) The spectral radius of non-asymptotic Wigner matrices -- these are symmetric matrices $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ whose entries above the diagonal are independent and satisfy $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{M}_{ij} = 0$, $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^2| \le \frac{1}{n}$, and $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^4| \le \frac{1}{n}$.
  (iii) The second eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, as drawn from the configuration model.
  In all three settings, we obtain constant-probability eigenvalue bounds that are tight up to a constant. Applied to specific random matrix ensembles, we recover classic bounds for Wigner matrices, as well as results of Bordenave--Chafa\"{i}--Garc\'{i}a-Zelada, Bordenave--Lelarge--Massouli\'{e}, and Friedman, up to constants.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Type Control Problems Driven by Jump-diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply a probabilistic approach to study general mean field type control (MFTC) problems with jump-diffusions, and give the first global-in-time solution. We allow the drift coefficient $b$ and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ to nonlinearly depend on the state, distribution and control variables, and both can be unbounded and possibly degenerate; besides, the jump coefficient $\gamma$ is allowed to be non-constant. To tackle the non-linear and control-dependent diffusion $\sigma$, we further formulate a joint cone property and estimates for both processes $P$ and $Q$ of the corresponding adjoint process (where $(P,Q,R)$ is the solution triple of the associated adjoint process as a backward stochastic differential equation with jump), in contrast to our previous single cone property of the only process $P$. We study first the system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps arising from the maximum principle, and then the related Jacobian flows, which altogether yield the classical regularity of the value function and thus allow us to show that the value function is the unique classical solution of the HJB integro-partial differential equation. Most importantly, our proposed probabilistic approach can apparently handle the MFTC problem driven by a fairly general process far beyond Brownian motion, in a relatively easier manner than the existing analytic approach.</description>

      <title>Local limit of focusing discrete NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a function sampled from the invariant measure associated to the focusing discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger equation, defined on a discrete torus of dimension $d \geq 3$, and nonlinearity parameter $p&gt;4$, in the infinite volume limit. The Gibbs measure has two parameters, the inverse temperature and the strength of the non linearity, and the scaling is such that the non linear and linear parts of the Hamiltonian contribute on the same scale. It was shown by Dey, Kirkpatrick and the first author that this measure undergoes a phase transition, concerning concentration of mass of a typical function {at the level of partition functions}. We prove that the three regions of the phase diagram yield three distinct local limits, a massive Gaussian free field, a massless Gaussian free field plus a random constant, and finally a (possibly trivial) mixture of massive Gaussian free fields, where some mass is ``lost'' to the region of concentration. {Our proof relies on the analysis of the spherical model of a ferromagnet.} The measure under consideration is an exponential tilt of the spherical model, and the additional tilt can be seen to induce an additional phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reflected generalized backward doubly stochastic differential equations driven by a non-homogeneous L\'evy process. Under stochastic conditions on the coefficients, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Furthermore, we apply these results to obtain a probabilistic representation for the viscosity solutions of an obstacle problem governed by stochastic integro-partial differential equations with a nonlinear Neumann boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Large deviations and almost sure convergence for the extremes of branching L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of supercritical branching Markov processes $\{\mathbb{X}_t, t \ge0\}$ whose spatial motions are L\'evy processes with regularly varying tails. Recently, Ren et al. [Appl. Probab. 61 (2024)] studied the weak convergence of the extremes of $\{\mathbb{X}_t, t \ge0\}$. In this paper, we establish the large deviation of $\{\mathbb{X}_t, t \ge0\}$ as well as some almost sure convergence results of the maximum of $\mathbb{X}_t$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and regularity properties of ODEs with semi-Markov switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a stochastic process obtained by random switching between a finite collection of vector fields. Such processes have recently been the focus of much attention in the case where the switching times are exponentially distributed, i.e., Markovian switching. In this contribution, we admit any distribution on $\mathbb{R}_+$ as a law for the switching times. We show that whenever this law is not singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, the stochastic process obtained from the random switching is Feller. More importantly, we give conditions on the switching and on the vector fields ensuring that the Lie bracket condition considered in the Markovian case in Bakhtin and Hurth (2012) and Bena\"im, Le Borgne, Malrieu and Zitt (2015) still imply ergodicity of the process.</description>

      <title>Weak Martingale Solutions of the Stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (SPLLG) system can characterize the spin transfer torque mechanism transferring the spin angular momentum to the magnetization dynamics through spin-magnetization coupling. We study the three-dimensional stochastic SPLLG system driven by a multiplicative stochastic force containing a continuous noise and a small jump noise. We establish the existence of weak martingale solutions based on the penalized functional technique, the Faedo-Galerkin approximation, stochastic compactness method, and a careful identification of the limit. Due to the strong coupling and strong nonlinearity caused by the SPLLG system and stochastic effects, some crucial difficulties have been encountered in obtaining energy estimates and avoiding non-negativity of the test function. We mainly utilize the structure of equations and the property of martingales developing the new energy estimates, and apply the three-layer approximation to overcome these difficulties. In particular, we extend the results by Z. Brze\'{z}niak and U. Manna (Comm. Math. Phys., 2019) and by L.H. Chai, C.J. Garc\'{\i}a-Cervera and X. Yang (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2018) to both the stochastic case and the coupling case.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of real valued random centrosymmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the eigenvalues of real valued large centrosymmetric random matrices via its linear eigenvalue statistic. This is essentially a central limit theorem (CLT) for sums of dependent random variables. The dependence among them leads to behavior that differs from the classical CLT. The main contribution of this article is finding the expression of the variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution. The crux of the proof lies in combinatorial arguments that involve counting overlapping loops in complete undirected weighted graphs with growing degrees.</description>

Abstract: We establish exact rates of convergence in the $p$-Wasserstein distance for the empirical measure of a class of non-symmetric jump processes, which are subordinated to a diffusion process on a compact Riemannian manifold. For the quadratic Wasserstein distance, we determine the renormalization limit. We extend the main results of \cite{WW} and \cite{WWZ}. Our method uses two key elements: a Bernstein-type inequality for the subordinated process and the PDE approach established in \cite{AMB}</description>

      <title>$K$-Branching Random Walk with Noisy Selection: Large Population Limits and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a variant of the Noisy $K$-Branching Random Walk, a population model that evolves according to the following procedure. At each time step, each individual produces a large number of offspring that inherit the fitness of their parents up to independent and identically distributed fluctuations. The next generation consists of a random sample of all the offspring so that the population size remains fixed, where the sampling is made according to a parameterized Gibbs measure of the fitness of the offspring. Our model interpolates between classical models of fitness waves and exhibits a novel phase transition in the propagation of the wave. By employing a stochastic Hopf-Cole transformation, we show that as we increase the population size, the random dynamics of the model can be described by deterministic operations acting on the limiting population densities. We then show that for fitness fluctuations with exponential tails, these operations admit a unique traveling wave solution with local stability. The traveling wave solution undergoes a phase transition when changing selection pressure, revealing a complex interaction between evolution and natural selection.</description>

      <title>Locally Lipschitz Path Dependent FBSDEs with Unbounded Terminal Conditions in Brownian and L{\'e}vy Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the analysis of forward backward stochastic differential equations driven by a L{\'e}vy process. We assume that the generator and the terminal condition are path-dependent and satisfy a local Lipschitz condition. We study solvability and Malliavin differentiability of such BSDEs. The proof of the existence and uniqueness is done in three steps. First of all, we truncate and localize the terminal condition and the generator. Then we use an iteration argument to get bounds for the solutions of the truncated BSDE (independent from the level of truncation). Finally, we let the level of truncation tend to infinity. A stability result ends the proof. The Malliavin differentiability result is based on a recent characterisation for the Malliavin Sobolev space D 1,2 by S. Geiss and Zhou.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in the Tree of Life: A Branching-Process RIFS Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a branching-process random iterated function system (RIFS) that formalizes the foundational principles of nestedness, duality, and randomness in the living tree of life (Hudnall &amp; D'Souza, 2025). In this construction, each leaf of a branching process generates a subtree at a strictly smaller contraction scale, thereby unifying classical branching processes and random IFS theory in a single framework. We prove rigorously that this branching-process RIFS is multifractal under explicit, mild assumptions. Two variants are analyzed: a non-anchored case with a nontrivial compact attractor, and a biologically motivated anchored case in which the invariant set collapses to a point while tangent measures obey the same multifractal law. Thus, multifractality emerges as a necessary mathematical consequence of nestedness, duality, and randomness, yielding a minimal-condition theorem that explains the ubiquity of multifractal signatures in biological data.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study a continuous time exponential utility maximization problem in the presence of a linear temporary price impact. More precisely, for the case where the risky asset is given by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process we compute the optimal portfolio strategy and the corresponding value. Our method of solution relies on duality, and it is purely probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Noise estimation of SDE from a single data trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25484</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for model discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) from a single trajectory, without requiring the ergodicity or stationary assumption on the underlying continuous process. By combining (stochastic) Taylor expansions with Girsanov transformations, and using the drift function's initial value as input, we construct drift estimators while simultaneously recovering the model noise. This allows us to recover the underlying $\mathbb P$ Brownian motion increments. Building on these estimators, we introduce the first stochastic Sparse Identification of Stochastic Differential Equation (SSISDE) algorithm, capable of identifying the governing SDE dynamics from a single observed trajectory without requiring ergodicity or stationarity. To validate the proposed approach, we conduct numerical experiments with both linear and quadratic drift-diffusion functions. Among these, the Black-Scholes SDE is included as a representative case of a system that does not satisfy ergodicity or stationarity.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>

Abstract: This article considers embeddings of bounded degree graphs into general metric spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation that relates the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded degree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings of graphs.
  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of metric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>What does the tree of life look like as it grows? Evolution and the multifractality of time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations to invariant measures of hybrid stochastic differential equations with superlinear coefficients via the backward Euler-Maruyama method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For stochastic stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching, whose drift and diffusion coefficients are allowed to contain superlinear terms, the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method is proposed to approximate the invariant measure. The existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure of the numerical solution generated by the BEM method is proved. Then the convergence of the numerical invariant measure to its underlying counterpart is shown. The results obtained in this work release the requirement of the global Lipschitz condition on the diffusion coefficient in [X. Li et al. SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 56(3)(2018), pp. 1435-1455]. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate those theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian system on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control problems for Hamiltonian dynamics on graphs have wide-ranging applications in mechanics and quantum field theory, particularly in systems with graph-based structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for a new class of Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations arising from the optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian systems (SWHSs) on graphs. One distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous involvement of the Wasserstein geometry on the Wasserstein space over graphs and the Euclidean geometry in physical space. The nonlinear geometric structure, along with the logarithmic potential induced by the graph-based state equation, adds further complexity to the analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce an energy-truncation technique within the doubling of variables framework, specifically designed to handle the interaction between the interiorly defined Wasserstein space on graphs and the unbounded Euclidean space. In particular, our findings demonstrate the well-posedness of HJB equations related to optimal control problems for both stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with polynomial nonlinearity and stochastic logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to develop HJB equations for the optimal control of SWHSs on graphs.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to the Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that, similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions, we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings, including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation and applications in Mean-Field Games.</description>

      <title>Optimally building spanning graphs in semirandom graph processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semirandom graph process constructs a graph $G$ in a series of rounds, starting with the empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a player is offered a vertex $v$ chosen uniformly at random, and chooses an edge on $v$ to add to $G$. The player's aim is to make $G$ satisfy some property as quickly as possible. Our interest is in the property that $G$ contain a given $n$-vertex graph $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. In 2021, Ben-Eliezer, Gishboliner, Hefetz and Krivelevich showed that there is a semirandom strategy that achieves this, with probability tending to 1 as $n$ tends to infinity, in $(1 + o_\Delta(1)) \frac{3 \Delta n}{2}$ rounds, where $o_\Delta(1)$ is a function that tends to $0$ as $\Delta$ tends to infinity. We improve this to $(1 + o_\Delta(1)) \frac{\Delta n}{2}$, which can be seen to be asymptotically optimal in $\Delta$. We show the same result for a variant of the semirandom graph process, namely the semirandom tree process introduced by Burova and Lichev, where in each round the player is offered the edge set of a uniformly chosen tree on $n$ vertices, and chooses one edge to keep.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of symmetric quantum walks on Hamming graphs, where the distance between vertices specifies the transition probability. A special model is the simple quantum walk on the hypercube, which has been discussed in the literature. Eigenvalues of the unitary operator of the quantum walks are zeros of certain self-reciprocal polynomials. We obtain a spectral representation of the wave vector, where our systematic treatment relies on the coin space isomorphic to the state space and the commutative association scheme. The limit distributions of several quantum walks are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: W-transforms are introduced as uniformity-preserving univariate transformations on the unit interval induced by distribution functions and piecewise strictly monotone functions, and their properties are investigated. When applied componentwise to random vectors with standard uniform univariate margins, W-transforms naturally serve as copula-to-copula transformations. Properties of the resulting W-transformed copulas, including their analytical form, density, measures of concordance, tail dependence and symmetries, are derived. A flexible parametric family of W-transforms is proposed as a special case to further enhance tractability. Illustrative examples highlight the introduced concepts, and improved dependence modelling is demonstrated in terms of a real-life dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "infamous upper tail problem" for $r$-uniform hypergraphs is to estimate the probability that the number of copies of a fixed hypergraph $H$ in a large binomial $r$-uniform hypergraph $\boldsymbol{G}$ exceeds its expectation by a constant factor. The problem was popularized by Janson and Ruci\'nski and, particularly in the case of graphs ($r=2$), has been a driving example in the development of nonlinear large deviations theory. Recent work of the first author with Dembo and Pham has accomplished the \emph{naive mean-field reduction step}, reducing the upper tail problem to an entropic variational problem on a space of weighted graphs. The latter was resolved for counts of $r$-uniform cliques and a certain linear 3-uniform hypergraph by Liu and Zhao, who also conjectured a general formula. We confirm their conjecture for other classes of hypergraphs, including complete $r$-partite $r$-graphs, tight cycles, and the Fano plane. We also prove a general large deviation upper bound for counts of $r$-graphs $H$ satisfying certain edge covering properties.</description>

Abstract: We consider invariant measures for the stochastic Burgers equation on $\mathbb{R}$, forced by the derivative of a spacetime-homogeneous Gaussian noise that is white in time and smooth in space. An invariant measure is indecomposable, or extremal, if it cannot be represented as a convex combination of other invariant measures. We show that for each $a\in\mathbb{R}$, there is a unique indecomposable law of a spacetime-stationary solution with mean $a$, in a suitable function space. We also show that solutions starting from spatially-decaying perturbations of mean-$a$ periodic functions converge in law to the extremal space-time stationary solution with mean $a$ as time goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: This study develops a numerical scheme for path-dependent FBSDEs and PDEs. We introduce a Picard iteration method for solving path-dependent FBSDEs, prove its convergence to the true solution, and establish its rate of convergence. A key contribution of our approach is a novel estimator for the martingale integrand in the FBSDE, specifically designed to handle path-dependence more reliably than existing methods. We derive a concentration inequality that quantifies the statistical error of this estimator in a Monte Carlo framework. Based on these results, we investigate a supervised learning method with neural networks for solving path-dependent PDEs. The proposed algorithm is fully implementable and adaptable to a broad class of path-dependent problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with noise correlated at scale $\rho \ll 1$ and of strength $|\log\rho|^{-1/2}\sigma(v)$ depending nonlinearly on the solution $v$. Under certain conditions, the first author and Gu have shown that the one-point statistics of $v$ converge in law as $\rho\to 0$ to the terminal value of an associated forward-backward SDE. Here, we show that the 2D stochastic heat equation is stable under renormalization with a new effective nonlinearity tied to the decoupling function of the forward-backward SDE. This allows us to extend the pointwise results to a much broader class of nonlinearities. We also show that these limiting pointwise statistics are insensitive to the fine details of the noise, and thus universal.</description>

Abstract: We study 2D nonlinear stochastic heat equations under a logarithmically attenuated white-noise limit with subcritical coupling. We show that solutions asymptotically exhibit Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations. This extends work of Ran Tao, which required a stricter condition on the coupling. Part of the limiting fluctuation is measurable with respect to the original noise and the remainder is independent. We also show that these statistics are universal in the sense that they are independent of the fine details of the model.</description>

Abstract: We prove Fuk-Nagaev and Rosenthal-type inequalities for sums of independent random matrices, focusing on the situation when the norms of the matrices possess finite moments of only low orders. Our bounds depend on the ``intrinsic'' dimensional characteristics such as the effective rank, as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the advantages of such results through several applications, including new moment inequalities for sample covariance matrices and their eigenvectors when the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed. Moreover, we demonstrate that our techniques yield sharpened versions of moment inequalities for empirical processes.</description>

      <title>Random Connection Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel model for random hypergraphs based on weighted random connection models. In accordance with the standard theory for hypergraphs, this model is constructed from a bipartite graph. In our stochastic model, both vertex sets of this bipartite graph form marked Poisson point processes, and the connection radius is inversely proportional to a product of suitable powers of the marks. Hence, our model is a common generalization of weighted random connection models and AB random geometric graphs. For this hypergraph model, we investigate the limit theory of various graph-theoretic and topological characteristics, including higher-order degree distributions, Betti numbers of the associated Dowker complex, and simplex counts. In particular, for the latter quantity, we identify regimes of convergence to normal and to stable distribution depending on the heavy-tailedness of the weight distribution. We conclude our investigation with a simulation study and an application to the collaboration network extracted from the arXiv dataset.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of phase transitions for graphical representations of the Ising model on tree-like graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the graphical representations of the Ising model on tree-like graphs. We construct a class of graphs on which the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$ model and the single random current exhibit a non-unique phase transition with respect to the inverse temperature, highlighting the non-monotonicity of both models. It follows from the construction that there exist infinite graphs $\mathbb{G}\subseteq \mathbb{G}'$ such that the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}'$ percolates and the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}$ does not. We also show that on the wired $d$-regular tree, the phase transitions of the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$, the single random current, and the random-cluster models are all unique and coincide.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic and distribution-uniform Koml\'os-Major-Tusn\'ady approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present nonasymptotic concentration inequalities for sums of independent and identically distributed random variables that yield asymptotic strong Gaussian approximations of Koml\'os, Major, and Tusn\'ady (KMT) [1975,1976]. The constants appearing in our inequalities are either universal or explicit, and thus as corollaries, they imply distribution-uniform generalizations of the aforementioned KMT approximations. In particular, it is shown that uniform integrability of a random variable's $q^{\text{th}}$ moment is both necessary and sufficient for the KMT approximations to hold uniformly at the rate of $o(n^{1/q})$ for $q &gt; 2$ and that having a uniformly lower bounded Sakhanenko parameter -- equivalently, a uniformly upper-bounded Bernstein parameter -- is both necessary and sufficient for the KMT approximations to hold uniformly at the rate of $O(\log n)$. Instantiating these uniform results for a single probability space yields the analogous results of KMT exactly.</description>

      <title>Variational Tail Bounds for Norms of Random Vectors and Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational tail bound for norms of random vectors under moment assumptions on their one-dimensional marginals. We also propose a simplified version of the bound that parametrizes the ``aggregating'' distribution in the proposed variational bound by considering a certain pushforward of the Gaussian distribution. We show that the proposed method reproduces some of the well-known bounds on norms of Gaussian random vectors, as well as a recent dimension-free concentration inequality for the spectral norm of sum of independent and identically distributed positive semidefinite matrices with sub-exponential marginals. We also obtain a similar concentration inequality for the sample covariance matrix of sub-exponential random vectors. Furthermore, we use coupling to formulate an abstraction of the proposed approach that applies more broadly.</description>

      <title>A note on the improved sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities for quadratic forms of sparse $\alpha$-sub-exponential random vectors with exponent parameter $\alpha\in(0, 2]$. In the regime $0&lt; \alpha\le 1$ we derive a refined inequality that is optimal in several canonical models. These results extend the classical Hanson-Wright bound to the sparse setting. Illustrative applications include covariance matrix estimation with incomplete observations, low-rank matrix approximation under the maximum norm with sparsified sketches, and concentration inequalities for sparse $\alpha$-sub-exponential random vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bond percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with an unbounded family of enhancements that enable additional bonds to act as open. A natural question is whether percolation occurs in this model if and only if percolation also occurs in the system with a finite subcollection of enhancements. We give an affirmative answer in dimension $d=2$ for symmetric families of connected enhancements, and in dimensions $d\ge 3$ we prove a partial result.</description>

      <title>The law of large numbers for discrete generalized quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{T}_p, \mathcal{T}_p)$ acting in a $p$-th Schatten class $\mathcal{T}_p$ in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for some $1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty$. Such a superoperator is called a pre-channel since it is an extension of a quantum channel to a wider class of operators without requirements of trace-preserving and positivity. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$ in the Banach space $\mathcal{T}_p$. The law of large numbers is known in the case $p=2$ in the form of the usual law of large numbers for random operators in a Hilbert space. We obtain the law of large numbers for the case $1\leqslant p \leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo on a single sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>
