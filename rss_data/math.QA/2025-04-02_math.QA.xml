      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalization and polarization of Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every family of orthogonal polynomials, we define a new realization of the Yangian of ${\mathfrak{gl}}_n$. Except in the case of Chebyshev polynomials, the new realizations do not satisfy the RTT relation. We obtain an analogue of the Christoffel-Darboux formula. Similar construction can be made for any family of functions satisfying certain recurrence relations, for example, $q$-Pochhhammer symbols and Bessel functions. Furthermore, using an analogue of the Jordan-Schwinger map, we define the ternary Yangian for an arbitrary semisimple Lie algebra as a flat deformation of the current algebra of certain ternary extension of the given Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Generalized free wreath products and their operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach on free wreath products, generalizing the constructions of Bichon and of Fima-Pittau. We show stability properties for certain approximation properties such as exactness, Haagerup property, hyperlinearity and K-amenability. We study qualitative properties of the associated von Neumann algebra: factoriality, primeness and absence of Cartan subalgebra and we give a formula for Connes' T-invariant. Finally, we give some explicit computations of K-theory groups for C*-algebras of generalized free wreath products.</description>

      <title>Some results on the higher-rank graphs associated to crystals of semisimple Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of the higher-rank graphs associated to finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras, introduced by the author and R. Yuncken, whose construction relies on Kashiwara's theory of crystals. First we prove that the Bruhat graphs of the corresponding Weyl groups, both weak and strong, can be embedded into the higher-rank graphs as colored graphs. Next, specializing to Lie algebras of type $A$, we connect some aspects of the construction of the higher-rank graphs with some well-known notions in combinatorics, most notably the keys of Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.</description>

      <title>A spanning tree model for chromatic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the discovery of Khovanov homology, which categorifies the Jones polynomial, an analogous categorification of the chromatic polynomial, known as chromatic homology, was introduced. Its graded Euler characteristic recovers the chromatic polynomial. In this paper, we present a spanning tree model for the chromatic complex, i.e., we describe a chain complex generated by certain spanning trees of the graph that is chain homotopy equivalent to the chromatic complex. We employ the spanning tree model over $\mathcal{A}_m:= \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x]}{&lt;x^m&gt;}$ algebra to answer two open questions. First, we establish the conjecture posed by Sazdanovic and Scofield regarding the homological span of chromatic homology over $\\mathcal{A}_m$ algebra, demonstrating that for any graph $G$ with $v$ vertices and $b$ blocks, the homological span is $v - b$. Additionally, we prove a conjecture of Helme-Guizon, Przytycki, and Rong concerning the existence of torsion of order dividing $m$ in chromatic homology over $\mathcal{A}_m$ algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>
