      <title>p-complete square-free Word-representation of Word-representable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V,E)$ is word-representable, if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that for letters ${x,y} \in V$ , $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in the graph $G$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of $p$-complete square-free word-representable graph $G(V,E)$. A word $w$ defined over alphabet $V$ is called $p$-complete square-free word if there does not exist any subset $S\subseteq \Sigma$ such that the word $w_{S}$ contains a square $XX$ where $|X| \ge p$ and $1\le p \le |w|/2$. A word-representable graph is considered $p$-complete square-free word-representable if there exists a $p$-complete square-free word-representant of that graph. This pattern is significant as it proves the existence of patterns that do not depend on graph labelling and cannot be avoided by certain classes of word-representable graphs. The class of word-representable graphs includes both $p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs and non-$p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs. Additionally, this concept generalises the square pattern found in the words. A word-representable graph is $p$-complete square-free uniform word-representable if its $p$-complete square-free word-representant is a uniform word. We analyse the properties of $p$-complete square-free uniform words and find that the graphs represented by these words avoid having $K_p$ (the complete graph on $p$ vertices) as an induced subgraph. We provide classifications for small values of $p$: for $p=1$, only complete graphs and for $p=2$, only complete and edgeless graphs satisfy the condition. We find that $K_3$-free circle graphs are 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable. Furthermore, we establish that only graphs with representation number at most 3 can be 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable and provide a constructive method to generate such graphs.</description>

      <title>Sideways on the highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two generalised ants (LLRRRL and LLRLRLL) which admit both highway behaviours and other kinds of emergent behaviours from initially finite configurations. This limits the well known Highway conjecture on Langton's ant as it shows that a generalised version of this conjecture generically does not hold on generalised ants.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings \((a, b, c)\), there exists a string \(z\) such that each of the values of conditional Kolmogorov complexity \(C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)\) is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We provide a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple \((a, b, c)\) for which no such string \(z\) exists. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on recent bounds on point-line incidences over prime fields. As an application, we show that this impossibility implies lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in the information-theoretic behavior of projective planes over fields with and without proper subfields.</description>
