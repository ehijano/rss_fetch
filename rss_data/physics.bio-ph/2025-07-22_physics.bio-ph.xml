      <title>Thermal Radiosensitization Beyond Misrepair: A Mechanistic Model of Temperature-Enhanced DNA Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Hyperthermia (HT), characterized by elevated tissue temperatures above physiological levels, is a well-established radiosensitizer. When combined with radiotherapy (RT), forming thermoradiotherapy (TRT), a synergistic effect is observed across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The greatest radiosensitization occurs when HT and RT are applied simultaneously. This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA repair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.
  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio (TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of vulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other physicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion processes, and medium density. The model includes misrepair effects phenomenologically, which make it consistent with other studies.
  Main results: The model reproduces TER values observed under simultaneous HT and RT in isolated plasmids with variable temperature. Our results indicate that, in addition to misrepair, other physical factors contribute to radiosensitization under concurrent treatment. Among these, the temperature-dependent amplification of DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section -- driven by enhanced DNA thermal fluctuations structure -- emerges as the second most influential factor.
  Significance: These findings suggest that thermal radiosensitization arises not only from impaired repair, but also from increased physical vulnerability of the DNA. The model provides mechanistic insight for optimizing TRT parameters.</description>

      <title>Climbing plants -- Wrapping elastic plant stems around a cylindrical stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Charles Darwin's time, the study of climbing plants on a cylindrical stake has been the subject of numerous articles in plant biology. One of the main ideas for studying the coiling of an elastic plant stem is to consider the growth of the plant stem in terms of evolution over time. However, as this development takes place over a long time scale, the static study alone has not been studied independently. Our static approach requires us to take into account elasticity, turgor pressure and gravity forces in a first analysis. The aim of this article is to present a simplified model demonstrating why plant stems climb mainly on their circular helix-shaped stakes, with the diameter of the stake playing an important role in plant stem ascent, as does the fineness of the stem. To perform this calculation, for a given mass density, we consider the variational principle of minimum energy. For thin plant stems, we can see, in first approximation, that the effect of gravity and turgor pressure can be neglected with respect to the energy of elasticity, and that the bulk of the calculation concerns elasticity terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of active matter models in which we keep track of fuel (stored energy) consumption. They are by construction, thermodynamically consistent. Using these models it is possible for us to observe and follow how active behaviour develops and also how it dissipates as the energy runs out. It is also straightforward to define, calculate and keep track of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Blood Glucose Levels with Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy and Chemometric Multivariate Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the blood NIR absorbances are recorded using the FT-IR method. It is shown that when the absorbance curves are multiplied by the first derivative of the water absorbance spectrum as well as by the first derivative of the glucose absorbance, the peaks related to the water interferent in the blood are effectively removed from the blood absorbance spectra, allowing for better distinction of the peaks of the blood glucose. The PCR prediction using this method shows smaller errors compared to the PCR employing the net absorbances, while the number of derived principal components is smaller in the PCR method based on the derivatives than the one based on the net absorbances. Additionally, the prediction of blood glucose levels using a linear regression model based on the molar absorptivity of glucose also demonstrates acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Order-disorder Transition in Incompressible Polar Active Fluids with an Easy Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dry active matter in an anisotropic medium is of experimental relevance, and the interplay between anisotropy and the dynamics of the active matter remains under-explored. Here, we derive the hydrodynamic equations of a generic dry polar active fluid that preferentially flows along a particular axis induced by the anisotropy of the medium. We then study its critical behavior at the order-disorder transition in which the symmetry between ``forward" and ``back" along the special axis is spontaneously broken. We obtain the critical static and dynamic exponents, mean velocity, and two point correlation functions exactly in three dimensions, and to two-loop level in two dimensions, by mapping our class of systems to the equilibrium Ising model with dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of Uncertainty in Neuron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that final-state uncertainty is ubiquitous in multistable systems of coupled neuronal maps, meaning that predicting whether one such system will eventually be chaotic or nonchaotic is often nearly impossible. We propose a "chance synchronization" mechanism that governs the emergence of unpredictability in neuron systems and support it by using basin classification, uncertainty exponent, and basin entropy techniques to analyze five simple discrete-time systems, each consisting of a different neuron model. Our results illustrate that uncertainty in neuron systems is not just a product of noise or high-dimensional complexity; it is also a fundamental property of low-dimensional, deterministic models, which has profound implications for understanding brain function, modeling cognition, and interpreting unpredictability in general multistable systems.</description>

      <title>Biological detail and graph structure in network neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endowing brain anatomy, dynamics, and function with a network structure is becoming standard in neuroscience. In its simplest form, a network is a collection of units and relationships between them. The pattern of relations among the units encodes numerous properties which have been shown to have a profound effect on networked systems' dynamics and function. In an effort to strike a balance between idealization and detail, network neuroscience studies typically involve simplifying assumptions at both neural and network modeling levels. However, the extent to which existing neural models depend on such approximations is as yet poorly understood. Here, we discuss whether and how increasing neurophysiological detail and generalizing the basic simple network structure often adopted in network neuroscience may help improve our understanding of brain phenomenology and function.</description>

      <title>Cell divisions imprint long lasting elastic strain fields in epithelial tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Bridging Smoothed Molecular Dynamics and Score-Based Learning for Conformational Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.</description>

      <title>The importance of being discrete -- An agent-based model for active nematics and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an agent-based model of active flexible rods. Inspired by cytoskeletal flows, we introduce activity by an internal flow that contributes to the dissipative forces. The active force between our agents is central and reciprocal, ensuring linear and angular momentum conservation. For nematic activity, we find spontaneous, thresholdless flows and stochastic flow-reorientation, which is accompanied by the formation of topological defects. Defects appear and vanish with activity-dependent rates, and $+1/2$-defects self-propel. These hallmarks of active turbulence are present even on the scale of individual agents. The particle-based interactions lead to an emergent coupling between density and orientation that generates density dipoles around $+1/2$-defects. Finally, we highlight the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and tissue growth. Our framework opens the way for an integrated description of living materials, including several forms of activity in the same system.</description>

      <title>Influence of High-Performance Image-to-Image Translation Networks on Clinical Visual Assessment and Outcome Prediction: Utilizing Ultrasound to MRI Translation in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the core traits of image-to-image translation (I2I) networks, focusing on their effectiveness and adaptability in everyday clinical settings. Methods: We have analyzed data from 794 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), using ten prominent 2D/3D I2I networks to convert ultrasound (US) images into MRI scans. We also introduced a new analysis of Radiomic features (RF) via the Spearman correlation coefficient to explore whether networks with high performance (SSIM&gt;85%) could detect subtle RFs. Our study further examined synthetic images by 7 invited physicians. As a final evaluation study, we have investigated the improvement that are achieved using the synthetic MRI data on two traditional machine learning and one deep learning method. Results: In quantitative assessment, 2D-Pix2Pix network substantially outperformed the other 7 networks, with an average SSIM~0.855. The RF analysis revealed that 76 out of 186 RFs were identified using the 2D-Pix2Pix algorithm alone, although half of the RFs were lost during the translation process. A detailed qualitative review by 7 medical doctors noted a deficiency in low-level feature recognition in I2I tasks. Furthermore, the study found that synthesized image-based classification outperformed US image-based classification with an average accuracy and AUC~0.93. Conclusion: This study showed that while 2D-Pix2Pix outperformed cutting-edge networks in low-level feature discovery and overall error and similarity metrics, it still requires improvement in low-level feature performance, as highlighted by Group 3. Further, the study found using synthetic image-based classification outperformed original US image-based methods.</description>
