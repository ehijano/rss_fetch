      <title>Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore nonlinear topological protection through the determination of nonlinear rules and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we can obtain definite evolution paths of zero-energy edge states that preserve topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally showcase the nonlinear topological edge states that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities that are compatible with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.</description>

      <title>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system coupled to environment at a fixed temperature and describe the reduced evolution of the system by means of a Redfield equation with effective time-dependent contact temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective contact temperature appears to be much higher, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a method which includes non-Markovian effects and can be further applied to various types of GKSL equations, beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of small lattice fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the hybridization of charged excitons with cavity photons, trion-polaritons (TP) in microcavity semiconductors are a promising avenue for realizing strong polariton interactions and many-body polariton phases. We develop a quantum field theoretical formalism to study the formation of trion-polaritons in a microcavity semiconductor doped with itinerant electrons within the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime. We predict a new class of many-body states resulting from the intriguing interplay of polarons and virtual photons in an uncharted territory of light-matter interactions and Feshbach physics.</description>

      <title>Control of quality factor of atomic force microscopy cantilever by cavity optomechanical effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality factor plays a fundamental role in dynamic mode atomic force microscopy. We present a technique to modify the quality factor of an atomic force microscopy cantilever within a Fabry-P\'erot optical interferometer. The experimental setup uses two separate laser sources to detect and excite the oscillation of the cantilever. While the intensity modulation of the excitation laser drives the oscillation of the cantilever, the average intensity can be used to modify the quality factor via optomechanical force, without changing the fiber-cantilever cavity length. The technique enables users to optimize the quality factor for different types of measurements without influencing the deflection measurement sensitivity. An unexpected frequency shift was also observed and modelled as temperature dependence of the cantilever's Young's modulus, which was validated using finite element simulation. The model was used to compensate for the thermal frequency shift. The simulation provided relations between optical power, temperature, and frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of circular graphene nanoribbons studied using tight-binding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of a circular graphene nanoribbon (carbon belt) in a magnetic field parallel to its central axis is studied using a tight-binding model. Orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using an analytical expression of the energy eigenvalues as a function of the magnetic flux density for any size, and its temperature dependence is considered. In the absence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the orbital magnetic susceptibility diverges at absolute zero if the chemical potential is zero and the number of atoms is a multiple of four. As the temperature increases, the magnitude of susceptibility decreases according to the power law, whose exponent depends on the size. In the presence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the divergence of the susceptibility near absolute zero disappears, and the sign changes with the transfer integral parallel to the magnetic field and the temperature.</description>

Abstract: Spinel oxides are recognized as promising Fenton-like catalysts for the degradation of antibiotics. However, the catalytic performance is restrained by the poor electron transfer rate (ETR).

      <title>Ultrafast carriers' separation imaging in WS2-WSe2 in plane heterojunction by transient reflectivity microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier transport in nanodevices plays a crucial role in determining their functionality. In the post-Moore era, the behavior of carriers near surface or interface domains the function of the whole devices. However, the femtosecond dynamics and nanometer-scale movement of carriers pose challenges for imaging their behavior. Techniques with high spatial-temporal resolution become imperative for tracking their intricate dynamics. In this study, we employed transient reflectivity microscopy to directly visualize the charge separation in the atomic interface of WS2-WSe2 in-plane heterojunctions. The carriers' drifting behavior was carefully tracked, enabling the extraction of drift velocities of 30 nm/ps and 10.6 nm/ps for electrons and holes. Additionally, the width of the depletion layer was determined to be 300 nm based on the carriers' moving trajectory. This work provides essential parameters for the potential effective utilization of these covalent in-plane heterojunctions,and demonstrates the success of transient optical imaging in unraveling the electrical behavior of nano devices, paving the way for a new avenue of electro-optical analysis.</description>

      <title>An ab-initio theory of inelastic electron tunneling spectrum of vibrating magnetic molecules adsorbed on superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb Interaction in Valley Photogalvanic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the photogalvanic current of electrons in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric Dirac materials possessing a nontrivial structure of valleys and exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The valley photogalvanic effect occurs here due to the trigonal warping of electrons and holes' dispersions in a given valley of the monolayer. We study the low-frequency limit of the external field: the field frequency is smaller than the temperature $T$, and the electron-electron and electron-hole scattering times are much larger than the electron-impurity scattering time. In this regime, we employ the Boltzmann transport equations and show that electron-hole scattering dominates electron-electron scattering in intrinsic semiconductors. Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the valley photogalvanic current can reduce the value of the bare photogalvanic current as these two currents flow in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Emergent Haldane Model and Photon-Valley Locking in Chiral Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of Haldane's topological graphene model in practical materials has presented significant challenges. Here, we propose achieving this model by embedding graphene in chiral cavities, using the asymptotically decoupled framework detailed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153603 (2021)]. Additionally, we introduce an equilibrium strategy for achieving valley polarization in this system with C2-symmetry breaking. Through numerical methods, we quantify the locking of photon numbers with Bloch electrons and calculate the topology-induced imbalance of valley photons. Furthermore, we elucidate that topological phase transition is characterized by the sign change of photon numbers during interband excitation. These findings underscore the remarkable potential of utilizing cavity quantum fluctuations to engineer electronic and photonic properties specific to valleys and topologies, particularly within the realm of strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Electrical reversal of the sign for magnon thermal Hall coefficient in van der Waals bilayer antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With spin-layer locking, the manipulation of spin degree of freedom via perpendicular electric field can be realized in a typical antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer. In analogy to the electric control of the anomalous layer Hall effect of electron within such bilayer system, we propose here its magnon counterpart i.e., thermal Hall effect controlled by a perpendicular electric field. Unlike electrons, magnon is charged neutral and its transport in solids can be driven by a thermal gradient. It also exhibits Hall response due to the intrinsic Berry curvature of magnon, analogous to the achievement in electron system. Taking bilayer 2H-VSe2 with both H-type stacking interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling as a platform, we perform first-principles calculations towards the magnetic exchange coupling parameters under applied electric field perpendicular to the plane. Based on linear spin wave approximation, we then fit the magnon band structures accordingly and calculate the corresponding Berry curvature. The thermal Hall coefficient dependence on the temperature under thermal gradient can be calculated correspondingly in linear response regime. It is shown that electric field reversal is able to reverse the sign of the coefficient. These findings provide a platform for the realization of all-electric magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron-hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule-metal interface. Here, we present a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;10^5) and reversible direction. The molecular system comprises a 7-armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on-surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half-populated in-gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, we demonstrate unipolar hole transport through the boron in-gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic electronics.</description>

      <title>Metal-semiconductor behavior along the line of stacking order change in gated multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gated multilayer graphene with stacking order change along the armchair direction. We consider some layers cracked to release shear strain at the stacking domain wall. The energy cones of graphene overlap along the corresponding direction in the k-space, so the topological gapless states from different valleys also overlap. However, these states strongly interact and split due to atomic-scale defects caused by the broken layers, yielding an effective energy gap. We find that for some gate voltages, the gap states cross and the metallic behavior along the stacking domain wall can be restored. In particular cases, a flat band appears at the Fermi energy. We show that for small variations of the gate voltage the charge occupying this band oscillates between the outer layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric fields represent an ideal means for controlling spins at the nanoscale and, more specifically, for manipulating protected degrees of freedom in multispin systems. Here we perform low-temperature magnetic far-IR spectroscopy on a molecular spin triangle (Fe3) and provide the first experimental evidence of spin-electric transitions in polynuclear complexes. The co-presence of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions, allows us to estimate the spin-electric coupling. Based on spin Hamiltonian simulations of the spectra, we identify the observed transitions and introduce the concept of a generalized exchange qubit. This applies to a wide class of molecular spin triangles, and includes the scalar chirality and the partial spin sum qubits as special cases.</description>

      <title>Performance of graphene Hall effect sensors: role of bias current, disorder and Fermi velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene Hall effect magnetic field sensors hold great promise for the development of ultra-sensitive magnetometers. Their performance is frequently analysed using the two-channel model where electron and hole conductivities are simply added. Unfortunately, this model is unable to capture all the features of the sensor, particularly the bias current dependence of the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we present an advanced model that provides an in-depth understanding of how graphene Hall sensors operate, and demonstrate its ability to quantitatively assess their performance. First, we report the fabrication of sensors with different qualities of graphene, with the best devices achieving magnetic field sensitivities as high as 5000 ohms/T, outperforming the best silicon and narrow-gap semiconductor-based sensors. Then, we examine their performance in detail using the proposed numerical model, which combines Boltzmann formalism, with distinct Fermi levels for electrons and holes, and a new method for the introduction of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles. Importantly, the dependences of magnetic field sensitivity on bias current, disorder, substrate and Hall bar geometry are quantitatively reproduced for the first time. In addition, the model emphasizes that the performance of devices with widths of the order of the charge carrier diffusion length, is significantly affected by the bias current due to the occurrence of large and non-symmetric carrier accumulation and depletion areas near the edges of the Hall bar. The formation of these areas induces a transverse diffusion particle flux capable of counterbalancing the particle flux induced by the Lorentz force when the Hall electric field cancels out in the ambipolar regime. Finally, we discuss how sensor performance can be enhanced by Fermi velocity engineering, paving the way for future ultra-sensitive graphene Hall effect sensors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Long Homochiral Graphene Nanoribbons Grown Within h-BN Stacks for High-Performance Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals encapsulation of two-dimensional materials within hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) stacks has proven to be a promising way to create ultrahigh-performance electronic devices. However, contemporary approaches for achieving van der Waals encapsulation, which involve artificial layer stacking using mechanical transfer techniques, are difficult to control, prone to contamination, and unscalable. Here, we report on the transfer-free direct growth of high-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) within h-BN stacks. The as-grown embedded GNRs exhibit highly desirable features being ultralong (up to 0.25 mm), ultranarrow ( &lt; 5 nm), and homochiral with zigzag edges. Our atomistic simulations reveal that the mechanism underlying the embedded growth involves ultralow GNR friction when sliding between AA'-stacked h-BN layers. Using the grown structures, we demonstrate the transfer-free fabrication of embedded GNR field-effect devices that exhibit excellent performance at room temperature with mobilities of up to 4,600 $cm^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and on-off ratios of up to $10^{6}$. This paves the way to the bottom-up fabrication of high-performance electronic devices based on embedded layered materials.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dimensional Approach to Dielectric Tuning Effects on Excitonic Parameters in 2D semiconductor materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated the potential of the fractional dimensional approach to understand exciton parameters in the exemplary atomically thin semiconductor material, a monolayer of WS$_2$. This approach has proved to be successful in finding the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle bandgap for the WS$_2$ monolayer in varying dielectric environments. A tuning of the quasiparticle bandgap and binding energy by 141 meV and 188 meV, respectively, has been achieved by varying the dielectric of the environment from 1.52 to 8.1. The approach is justified by comparing the changes in the binding energy with the computational results from the Quantum Electrostatic Heterostructures model. The fractional dimension found through the excitonic Rydberg series is close to 2.8 for WS$_2$ monolayer in all different dielectric surroundings. Thus, this approach provides a rapid and robust method for determining the binding energy of excitons in 2D semiconductors independent of the particular dielectric environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet nanosecond laser annealing (UV-NLA) proves to be an important technique, particularly when tightly controlled heating and melting are necessary. In the realm of semiconductor technologies, the significance of laser annealing (NLA) grows in tandem with the escalating intricacy of integration schemes in nano-scaled devices. Silicon-germanium alloys have been studied for decades for their compatibility with silicon devices. Indeed, they enable the manipulation of properties like strain, carrier mobilities and bandgap. Laser melting on such type of layers, however results, up to now, in the development of extended defects and poor control over layer morphology. In our study, we investigate the laser melting of ~700 nm thick relaxed silicon-germanium samples coated with SiO2 nano-arrays, achieving a precise control of the melting process, without observing the formation of extended defects at the interface left by the liquid front. We found the geometrical parameters of the silicon oxide having an impact on the thermal budget samples see, influencing melt threshold, melt depth and germanium distribution.</description>

Abstract: Spin torque nano-oscillators realized by magnetization dynamics trapped in a current-induced potential are reported. We fabricated Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Pt nanostructures and measured current-induced microwave emission from the structures. The result shows an increase in the magnitude and spectral narrowing of the microwave emission. We demonstrate that the current-induced magnetic field suppresses magnon radiation loss and significantly reduces the linewidth and the threshold current required for the spin torque oscillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performances of an imperfect quantum many-body Otto engine based on free-fermion systems. Starting from the thermodynamic definitions of heat and work along ideal isothermal, adiabatic, and isochoric transformations, we generalize these expressions in the case when the hypotheses of ideality are relaxed (i.e., nonperfect thermalization with the external baths, as well as nonperfect quantum adiabaticity in the unitary dynamic protocols). These results are used to evaluate the work and the power delivered by an imperfect quantum many-body heat engine in a finite time, whose working substance is constituted by a quantum Ising chain in a transverse field: We discuss the emerging optimal working points as functions of the various model parameters.</description>

      <title>Tailoring topological band properties of twisted double bilayer graphene: effects due to spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our theoretical study unfolds the topological phase transitions (within bands of the Moir\'e super-lattice) in small angle twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) under the influence of external gate voltage and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for both AB-AB and AB-BA stacking configurations. Utilizing a low-energy continuum model, we investigate the band structure and perform a comprehensive topological characterization of the system by analysing the direct band gap closing as well as various Chern numbers. In the absence of SOC, the tDBLG exhibits characteristics of a valley Hall insulator. However, in the presence of SOC, we observe a transition to a quantum spin Hall insulator state and band topology emerges in the parameter spaces of non-topological regime without SOC. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between untwisted double bilayer graphene and tDBLG to assess the impact of twisting on the system's properties. Our findings reveal the construction of topological phase diagrams that showcase distinct phases arising from changes in the twist angle compared to the untwisted case. These phase diagrams provide valuable insights into the diverse topological phases achievable in tDBLG with SOC. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between small twist angle, SOC, and external electric field on the topological band properties of twisted multilayer graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion on Magnetic Tunnel Junction: Interweaving Quantum Transport with Micro-magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental interest, and diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junction (ST-MTJ), in this work, we present non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based description of ST-MTJs both for N\'eel and Bloch textures, to capture the spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the ST-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetrical voltage dependence of spin torque. We delineate the voltage-induced rotation of the spin current texture, coupled with the appearance of helicity in spin current, particularly in the case of N\'eel skyrmions on MTJs. We describe the TMR roll-off in ST-MTJ with lower cross-sectional area and higher temperature based on transmission spectra analysis. We also introduce a computationally efficient coupled spatio-eigen framework of NEGF to address the 3D-NEGF requirement of the ST-MTJs. With analytical underpinning, we establish the generic nature of the spatio-eigen framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine-qua-non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that lack transnational invariance and simultaneous eigen-basis in the transverse directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this perspective, we discuss thermal imbalance and the associated electron-mediated thermal transport in quantum electronic devices at very low temperatures. We first present the theoretical approaches describing heat transport in nanoscale conductors at low temperatures, in which quantum confinement and interactions play an important role. We then discuss the experimental techniques for generating and measuring heat currents and temperature gradients on the nanoscale. Eventually we review the most important quantum effects on heat transport, and discuss implications for quantum technologies and future directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Casimir force softening originated from surface electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

      <title>Kelvin equation for bridging transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions between a pair of non-planar surfaces. We show that the transition can be described using a generalized Kelvin equation by mapping the system to a slit of finite length. The proposed equation is applied to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the growth of the bridging film, which occurs when the confining walls are gradually flattened. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law divergence with geometry-dependent critical exponents that we determine for a wide class of walls' geometries. In particular, for a linear-wedge model, a covariance law revealing a relation between a geometric and Young's contact angle is presented. These predictions are shown to be fully in line with the numerical results obtained from a microscopic (classical) density functional theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer stacking morphology in nanocarbons is paramount for achieving new properties and outperforming applications. Here, we demonstrate that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) retain crystallinity and a stacking structure from CVD graphene grown on Ni foam. Our results reveal that GQD subdomains comprise a few-layer graphene structure in the AB -- AB and ABC -- ABC stacking configuration. HR-TEM images along with a multiple-approach characterization (XRD, XPS, UV-vis, AFM, and ATR-IR) exhibit 3.0 to 8.0 nm crystalline GQDs with 2-6 graphene layers thick indicating a disk-shape structure. The UV-vis profiles show changes in color of the dispersion (from colorless to red) during and after the electrochemistry, suggesting a systematic electrooxidation of graphene into smaller, highly crystalline, and more complex sp2/sp3 structures. Importantly, a control experiment performed under the same conditions but with a graphitic rod exhibited large, polydisperse, and multilayer carbon structures. This work demonstrates a relatively easy electrochemical synthesis to obtain GQDs which retain the pristine and, in turn, distinctive structure of graphene grown on Ni foam.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focusses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $N\leq4$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this letter, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates are localized on a subset of sites and are exhibiting the NH skin effect. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins associated to solid-state colour centers are a promising platform for investigating quantum computation and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated multi-qubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic quantum error correction protocols. One of the key open challenges towards larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the two-qubit system formed by the electron and nuclear spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We use gate set tomography (GST) to systematically optimise the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to $99.999(1)\%$ and a two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.93(5) \%$. Our gates are designed to decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear spin systems. The high fidelities demonstrated provide new opportunities towards larger-scale quantum processing with colour-center qubits.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Exchange Fields for Ab-initio Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc., following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid industrial development, many dye pollutants have entered the water, along with heavy metals like As, leading to complex pollution that threatens the ecological environment and human health. Therefore, designing an effective strategy for treating complex dye wastewater is urgent. Herein, we have constructed high-purity pyrite FeS$_2$ nanoplates as bifunctional catalysts for the simultaneous removal of dyes and arsenite (As(III)).</description>

      <title>Coherent Acoustic Control of Defect Orbital States in the Strong-Driving Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a bulk acoustic wave resonator to demonstrate coherent control of the excited orbital states in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center at cryogenic temperature. Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multi-phonon orbital Rabi oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement between our measurements, quantum master equation simulations, and a Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus acoustic drive strength that is non-perturbative in the drive strength and agrees well with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuous wave spin resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured few-to-several nanoseconds orbital decoherence times. We discuss the outlook for orbital decoherence protection.</description>

      <title>Carrier confinement and alloy disorder exacerbate Auger-Meitner recombination in AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum efficiency of AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) declines (droops) at increasing operating powers due to Auger-Meitner recombination (AMR). Using first-principles density-functional theory, we show that indirect AMR mediated by electron-phonon coupling and alloy disorder can induce bulk $C$ coefficients as large as $\sim10^{-31}$ cm$^6$/s. Furthermore, we find that the confinement of carriers by polarization fields within quantum wells severely relaxes crystal-momentum conservation, which exacerbates the rate of AMR over radiative recombination by an order of magnitude relative to the bulk. This results in a striking decrease in quantum efficiency at high power. Suppressing polarization fields and jointly increasing the well width would greatly mitigate AMR and efficiency droop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum thermodynamics and the role of heat currents in quantum information settings. Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current fluctuations limited to the working substance.</description>

      <title>Merons and magnetoelectric switching in centrosymmetric spiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral multiferroics exhibit a strong coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, allowing cross-control. Since the seminal work of Kimura et al. in 2003, these materials have attracted great interest galvanized by the prospect of new high-efficiency memory devices, where magnetic (electric) bits are switched via an external electric (magnetic) field. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying such a switching process - the electric field-driven dynamics of domain walls (DWs) - is still poorly understood. We address this problem for meron DWs, which represent one of the main DW types in spiral multiferroics and consist of an array of meron (half-skyrmion) strings. Minimum energy walls feature merons with alternating topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with the limiting velocity set by magnon speed. Low-energy defects in this alternating charge sequence, which appear during domain nucleation, can lead to DWs with net topological charge. This induces a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, merons translate within the wall, and the DW mobility is suppressed. The topological charge of the wall and the meron helicity can be easily modified via an external magnetic and electric field, respectively, offering fine control over DW dynamics. Defects within the meron strings, analogous to Bloch points, have hedgehog-like spin texture and are strongly pinned to the lattice. The fascinating interplay between domain wall motion, translation of merons within the wall, and precession of spins in the entire domains opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of topological spin textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient quantum sensing technologies rely on precise control of quantum sensors, particularly two-level systems or qubits, to optimize estimation processes. We here exploit the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) as a tool for maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors, with a specific focus on the level avoided crossing (LAC) phenomenon in qubit systems. While the estimation of the LAC energy splitting has been extensively studied, we emphasize the crucial role that the QZE can play in estimating the coupling strength. We introduce the concept of information amplification by the QZE for a LAC system under off-resonant conditions. The proposed approach has implications for AC magnetic field sensing and the caracterization of complex systems, including many-spin systems requiring the estimation of spin-spin couplings. Overall, our findings contribute to the advancement of quantum sensing by leveraging the QZE for improved control and information extraction.</description>

      <title>Surface region band enhancement in noble gas adsorption assisted ARPES on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic states near surface regions can be distinct from bulk states, which are paramount in understanding various physical phenomena occurring at surfaces and in applications in semiconductors, energy, and catalysis. Here, we report an abnormal surface region band enhancement effect in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5, by depositing noble gases with fine control. In contrast to conventional surface contamination, the intensity of surface region Sb band can be enhanced more than three times with noble gas adsorption. In the meantime, a hole-dope effect is observed for the enhanced surface region band, with other bands hardly changing. The doping effect is more pronounced with heavier noble gases. We propose that noble gas atoms selectively fill into alkali metal vacancy sites on the surface, which improves the surface condition, boosts surface region bands, and effectively dopes it with the Pauli repulsion mechanism. Our results provide a novel and reversible way to improve surface conditions and tune surface region bands by controlled surface noble gas deposition.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Entangling Gates for Electron and Nuclear Spin Qubits in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental progress in exploring the use of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum computing platform, we propose schemes for fast and high-fidelity entangling gates on this platform. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that synchronization effects between resonant and off-resonant transitions may be exploited such that spin-flip errors due to strong driving may be eliminated by adjusting the gate time or the driving field. This allows for fast, high fidelity entangling operations between the electron spin and one or several nuclear spins. We investigate a two-qubit system where the NV center is comprised of a $^{15}$N atom and a qubit-qutrit system for the case of a $^{14}$N atom. In both cases, we predict a complete suppression of off-resonant driving errors for two-qubit gates when addressing the NV electron spin conditioned on states of nuclear spins of the nitrogen atom of the defect. Additionally, we predict fidelities $&gt;0.99$ for multi-qubit gates when including the surrounding $^{13}$C atoms in the diamond lattice in the conditioned logic.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb assisted hopping on STM signal: extended two site Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping. We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current (instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis). We find an exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling between tip and sample) an expression for the current as a function of the bias voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are non-trivial corrections where the dI/dV (the rate of change of the current with respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard model analysis would predict.</description>

      <title>Scattering Singularity in Topological Dielectric Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of topology in natural materials and metamaterials has garnered significant attention. Notably, the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, assessed through tight-binding approximations, has been extensively investigated in both quantum and classical systems, encompassing general and higher-order topology. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive examination of these models from the perspective of wave physics, particularly the scattering view, remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically unveil the origin of the 1D and 2D Zak phases stemming from the zero-scattering point, termed the scattering singularity in k-space. Employing an expanded plane wave expansion, we accurately compute the reflective spectrum of an infinite 2D photonic crystal (2D-PhC). Analyzing the reflective spectrum reveals the presence of a zero-scattering line in the 2D-PhC, considered the topological origin of the non-trivial Zak phase. Two distinct models, representing omnidirectional non-trivial cases and directional non-trivial cases, are employed to substantiate these findings. Our work introduces a novel perspective for characterizing the nature of non-trivial topological phases. The identification of the zero-scattering line not only enhances our understanding of the underlying physics but also provides valuable insights for the design of innovative devices.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100 G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-protrusion (NP) on metal surface and its inevitable contamination layer under high electric field is often considered as the primary precursor that leads to vacuum breakdown, which plays an extremely detrimental effect for high energy physics equipment and many other devices. Yet, the NP growth has never been experimentally observed. Here, we conduct field emission (FE) measurements along with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging of an amorphous-carbon (a-C) coated tungsten nanotip at various nanoscale vacuum gap distances. We find that under certain conditions, the FE current-voltage (I-V) curves switch abruptly into an enhanced-current state, implying the growth of an NP. We then run field emission simulations, demonstrating that the temporary enhanced-current I-V is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that a NP has grown at the apex of the tip. This hypothesis is also confirmed by the repeatable in-situ observation of such a nano-protrusion and its continued growth during successive FE measurements in TEM. We tentatively attribute this phenomenon to field-induced biased diffusion of surface a-C atoms, after performing a finite element analysis that excludes the alternative possibility of field-induced plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Identification of mechanisms of magnetic transitions using an efficient method for converging on first order saddle points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of magnetic systems is described and several applications presented. The starting point of the iterative algorithm involved in the method can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of a magnetic system and, in contrast to chain-of-states methods, the final state need not be specified. Convergence on the saddle points is guided by a negative energy gradient whose component along the minimum mode of the system is inverted, effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without evaluation of the Hessian itself. The efficient implementation of the method and its linear scaling with the system size make it applicable to large systems. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers and globules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many bacteria share the fascinating ability to sense Earth's magnetic field -- a process known as magnetotaxis. These bacteria synthesize magnetic nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, within their own cell body and arrange them to form a linear magnetic chain. The chain, which behaves like a compass needle, aligns the microorganisms with the geomagnetic field. Here, we measure the magnetic hysteresis of an individual bacterium of the species Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense via ultrasensitive torque magnetometry. These measurements, in combination with transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, reveal the magnetic configurations of the magnetosomes, their progression as a function of applied field, as well as the total remanent magnetic moment and effective magnetic anisotropy of a chain within a single bacterium. Knowledge of magnetic properties is crucial both for understanding the mechanisms behind magnetotaxis and for the design of systems exploiting magnetotactic bacteria in biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate light-matter coupling in the cuprate superconductor La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$Cu0$_4$ (LSCO), accomplished by adhering metamaterial resonator arrays (MRAs) to a c-axis oriented single crystal. The resonators couple to the Josephson Plasma Mode (JPM) which manifests as a plasma edge in the terahertz reflectivity in the superconducting state. Terahertz reflectivity measurements at 10K reveal a renormalization of the JPM frequency, $\omega_{jpm}$, from 1.7 THz for the bare crystal to $\sim$1 THz with the MRAs. With increasing temperature, the modified $\omega_{jpm}$ redshifts as expected for decreasing superfluid density, vanishing above T$_{c}$. The modification of the electrodynamic response arises from resonator induced screening of the longitudinal polariton response, reminiscent of plasmon-phonon coupling in doped semiconductors. Modeling reveals that the electrodynamic response is fully interpretable using classical electromagnetism. Future studies will have to contend with the large effects we observe which could obscure subtle changes that may indicate cavity-based manipulation of superconductivity. Finally, we note that our MRA/LSCO structure is a tunable epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial that exhibits a nonlinear response arising from the c-axis Josephson tunneling coupled with the local fields of the resonators.</description>

      <title>Recovering the activity parameters of an active fluid confined in a sphere</title>

Abstract: The properties of an active fluid, for example, a bacterial bath or a collection of microtubules and molecular motors, can be accessed through the dynamics of passive particle probes. Here, in the perspective of analyzing experimental situations of confinement in droplets, we consider the kinematics of a negatively buoyant probe particle in an active fluid, both confined within a spherical domain. The active bath generates a fluctuating flow that pushes the particle with a velocity that is modeled as a colored stochastic noise, characterized by two parameters, the intensity and memory time of the active flow. When the particle departs a little from the bottom of the spherical domain, the configuration is well approximated by a particle in a two-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to the colored noise, in which case an analytical solution exists, which is the base for quantitative analysis. We numerically simulate the dynamics of the particle and use the planar, two-dimensional mean square displacement to recover the activity parameters of the bath. This approach yields satisfactory results as long as the particle remains relatively confined, that is, as long as the intensity of the colored noise remains low.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the lowest thickness limit for room-temperature ferromagnetism of Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study establishes Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ as a platform material, viable for ferromagnetic nanoscale devices and magnetic-memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven Langevin modeling of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we transformed a set of 1,000 scientific papers in the area of biological materials into detailed ontological knowledge graphs, revealing their inherently scale-free nature. Using graph traversal path detection between dissimilar concepts based on combinatorial ranking of node similarity and betweenness centrality, we reveal deep insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, and propose never-before-seen material designs and their behaviors. One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. The algorithm further created an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite that incorporates joint synthesis of graph sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's Composition VII painting, where the resulting composite reflects a balance of chaos and order, with features like adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across physical, biological, and artistic spheres, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence and material flux that resonates with postmodern philosophy, and positions these interconnections within a heterarchical framework. Our findings reveal the dynamic, context-dependent interplay of entities beyond traditional hierarchical paradigms, emphasizing the significant role of individual components and their fluctuative relationships within the system. Our predictions achieve a far higher degree of novelty, technical detail and explorative capacity than conventional generative AI methods. The approach establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections that facilitate discovery.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional or bi-directional NHSE and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase, the winding number, and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonreciprocal charge transport from quantum Hall states in a topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in quantum materials is of great importance and can lead to nonreciprocal charge transport. Topological insulators provide a unique platform to study nonreciprocal charge transport due to their surface states, especially quantum Hall states under external magnetic field. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal charge transport mediated by quantum Hall states in devices composed of the intrinsic topological insulator Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S, which is attributed to asymmetric scattering between quantum Hall states and Dirac surface states. A giant nonreciprocal coefficient of up to 2.26*10^5 A^-1 is found. Our work not only reveals the properties of nonreciprocal charge transport of quantum Hall states in topological insulators, but also paves the way for future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond-adiabatic Quantum Admittance of a Semiconductor Quantum Dot at High Frequencies: Rethinking Reflectometry as Polaron Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16725v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Features of phonon scattering by a spherical pore: molecular dynamics insight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is still a gap in understanding phonons scattering by geometrical defects at the nanoscale, and it remains a significant challenge for heat transfer management in nanoscale devices and systems. In this study, we aim to explore the characteristics of phonon scattering by a single pore to gain insights into thermal transport in nanostructures. The paper outlines a methodology for assessing the spatial distribution of the magnitude of the radial, azimuthal, and polar components of the velocity of scattered phonons by a spherical pore. We demonstrated that the size parameter, commonly employed in electromagnetic wave scattering theory, is vital in determining the scattering regime. Specifically, we show that calculated scattering efficiency has the same pattern as one commonly obtained in classical wave scattering theory. However, we found that crystallographic directions are pivotal in shaping the scattering patterns, especially in the regions where scattering patterns are defined by the Mie resonances. This observation holds significance in understanding the influence of phonon coherence on thermal transport in nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Suppressed weak anti-localization in topological insulator - antiferromagnetic insulator (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ - MnF$_2$ thin film bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin films of the topological insulator (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ oriented along the [0001] direction were grown via molecular beam epitaxy on substrates of Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) and MgF$_2$ (110) single crystals, as well as on an epitaxial thin film of the antiferromagnetic insulator MnF$_2$ (110). Magnetoconductivity measurements of these samples showed close proximity of the Fermi level to the Dirac point and weak antilocalization at low temperature that was partially suppressed in the sample grown on the MnF$_2$ layer. The magnetoconductivity data were fit to a model that describes the quantum corrections to the conductivity for the Dirac surface state of a 3-dimensional topological insulator, from which values of the Fermi velocity and the phase coherence length of the surface state charge carriers were derived. The magnetoconductivity of the (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ - MnF$_2$ bilayer samples were fit to a model describing the crossover from weak antilocalization to weak localization due to magnetic doping. The results are consistent with the opening of an energy gap at the Dirac point in the (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ due to magnetic proximity interactions of the topological surface states with the antiferromagnetic MnF$_2$ insulator.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase where we explicitly show the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Treatment of Relativistic Effects with Periodic Density Functional Methods: Energies, Gradients, and Stress Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03817v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of an efficient self-consistent field (SCF) method including both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory (DFT) is presented. We make use of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and all integrals are evaluated in real space. Our implementation supports density functional approximations up to the level of meta-generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs) for SCF energies and gradients. The latter can be used to compute the stress tensor and consequently allow us to optimize the cell structure. Considering spin-orbit interaction requires the extension of the standard procedures to a two-component (2c) formalism and a non-collinear approach for open-shell systems. Here, we implemented both the canonical and the Scalmani-Frisch non-collinear DFT formalisms, with hybrid and range-separated hybrid functionals being presently restricted to SCF energies. We demonstrate both efficiency and relevance of spin-orbit effects for the electronic structure of discrete systems and systems periodic in one to three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Controllable magnetic states in chains of coupled phi-0 Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic weak links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction with anomalous phase shift (phi_0-S/F/S JJ) is a system, where the anomalous ground state shift phi_0 provides a direct magnetoelectric coupling between a magnetic moment and a phase of the superconducting condensate. If a chain of such phi_0-S/F/S JJs are coupled via superconducting leads, the condensate phase, being a macroscopic quantity, mediates a long-range interaction between the magnetic moments of the weak links. We study static and dynamic magnetic properties of such a system. It is shown that it manifests properties of n-level system, where the energies of the levels are only determined by projections of the total magnetic moment onto the easy magnetic axis. It is similar to a magnetic atom in a Zeeman field, but the role of the field is played by the magnetoelectric coupling. However, unlike an atom in a magnetic field, the relative order of energies of different states is controlled by electrical means. It is also demonstrated that the total magnetic moment can be fully controlled by a supercurrent and the response of the magnetic system to local external perturbations is highly nonlocal.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected emergent Fermi surface in an Abrikosov vortex lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional (3D) fully gapped type-II superconductor can feature emergent in-gap Fermi surfaces of Caroli-de Gennes Matricon (CdGM) quasiparticles in the presence of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. In particular, these CdGM Fermi surfaces manifest in the emergent 3D band structure enabled by the intervortex tunneling physics, and their stability is guaranteed by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index. By developing an effective analytical theory, we find that each vortex line carrying a 1D nodal dispersion is a sufficient condition for the vortex lattice to form CdGM Fermi surfaces. Following this prediction, in-gap CdGM Fermi surfaces are numerically confirmed in a microscopic vortex-lattice simulation of a superconducting Dirac semimetal with an $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing, which is directly applicable to a large class of type-II superconductors such as LiFeAs. Remarkably, the CdGM Fermi surfaces persist even when the normal state is deformed to a doped insulator of trivial band topology. Our work establishes the vortex lattice as a new experimentally feasible control knob for emergent topological phenomena in conventional superconductors.</description>
