      <title>Don't Trust A Single Gerrymandering Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, in an effort to promote fairness in the election process, a wide variety of techniques and metrics have been proposed to determine whether a map is a partisan gerrymander. The most accessible measures, requiring easily obtained data, are metrics such as the Mean-Median Difference, Efficiency Gap, Declination, and GEO metric. But for most of these metrics, researchers have struggled to describe, given no additional information, how a value of that metric on a single map indicates the presence or absence of gerrymandering.
  Our main result is that each of these metrics is gameable when used as a single, isolated quantity to detect gerrymandering (or the lack thereof). That is, for each of the four metrics, we can find district plans for a given state with an extremely large number of Democratic-won (or Republican-won) districts while the metric value of that plan falls within a reasonable, predetermined bound. We do this by using a hill-climbing method to generate district plans that are constrained by the bounds on the metric but also maximize or nearly maximize the number of districts won by a party.
  In addition, extreme values of the Mean-Median Difference do not necessarily correspond to maps with an extreme number of districts won. Thus, the Mean- Median Difference metric is particularly misleading, as it cannot distinguish more extreme maps from less extreme maps. The other metrics are more nuanced, but when assessed on an ensemble, none perform substantially differently from simply measuring number of districts won by a fixed party.
  One clear consequence of these results is that they demonstrate the folly of specifying a priori bounds on a metric that a redistricting commission must meet in order to avoid gerrymandering.</description>

      <title>Website visits can predict angler presence using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting recreational fishing activity is important for sustainable fisheries management. However, traditional methods of measuring fishing pressure, such as surveys, can be costly and limited in both time and spatial extent. Predictive models that relate fishing activity to environmental or economic factors typically rely on historical data, which often restricts their spatial applicability due to data scarcity. In this study, high-resolution angler-generated data from an online platform and easily accessible auxiliary data were tested to predict daily boat presence and aerial counts of boats at almost 200 lakes over five years in Ontario, Canada. Lake-information website visits alone enabled predicting daily angler boat presence with 78% accuracy. While incorporating additional environmental, socio-ecological, weather and angler-generated features into machine learning models did not remarkably improve prediction performance of boat presence, they were substantial for the prediction of boat counts. Models achieved an R2 of up to 0.77 at known lakes included in the model training, but they performed poorly for unknown lakes (R2 = 0.21). The results demonstrate the value of integrating angler-generated data from online platforms into predictive models and highlight the potential of machine learning models to enhance fisheries management.</description>

      <title>Planned behavior, perceptual biases, and the dynamics of collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classical models of collective behavior assume that emergent dynamics result from external and observable interactions among individuals. However, how collective dynamics in human populations depend on the internal psychological processes of individuals remains underexplored. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the effects of internal psychology on the dynamics of collective action. Our model is grounded in the theory of planned behavior -- a well-established conceptual framework in social psychology that links intrinsic beliefs to behavior. By incorporating temporal biases in social perception and individual differences in decision-making processes into our model, we find that the interplay between internal and external drivers of behavior can produce diverse outcomes, ranging from partial participation in collective action to rapid or delayed cascades of action-taking. These distinct outcomes are preceded by transient dynamics that are qualitatively similar to one another, which, just as in real-world scenarios, makes it difficult to predict long-term collective dynamics from early observations. Our model thus provides a useful test bed for methods that aim to predict the emergence of collective action, and it lays the groundwork for studying the nuanced dynamics of collective human behavior arising from the interaction between psychological processes and observable actions.</description>

      <title>Impact of opinion formation phenomena in epidemic dynamics: kinetic modeling on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, it became increasingly evident that individuals' thoughts and beliefs can have a strong impact on disease transmission. It becomes therefore important to understand how information and opinions on protective measures evolve during epidemics. To this end, incorporating the impact of social media is essential to take into account the hierarchical structure of these platforms. In this context, we present a novel approach to take into account the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and socially-structured opinion dynamics. Our work extends a conventional compartmental framework including behavioral attitudes in shaping public opinion and promoting the adoption of protective measures under the influence of different degrees of connectivity. The proposed approach is capable to reproduce the emergence of epidemic waves. Specifically, it provides a clear link between the social influence of highly connected individuals and the epidemic dynamics. Through a heterogeneity of numerical tests we show how this comprehensive framework offers a more nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics in the context of modern information dissemination and social behavior.</description>

      <title>Intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media: A bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely distributed misinformation shared across social media channels is a pressing issue that poses a significant threat to many aspects of society's well-being. Inaccurate shared information causes confusion, can adversely affect mental health, and can lead to mis-informed decision-making. Therefore, it is important to implement proactive measures to intervene and curb the spread of misinformation where possible. This has prompted scholars to investigate a variety of intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media. This study explores the typology of intervention strategies for addressing misinformation sharing on social media, identifying 4 important clusters - cognition-based, automated-based, information-based, and hybrid-based. The literature selection process utilized the PRISMA method to ensure a systematic and comprehensive analysis of relevant literature while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. A total of 139 articles published from 2013-2023 were then analyzed. Meanwhile, bibliometric analyses were conducted using performance analysis and science mapping techniques for the typology development. A comparative analysis of the typology was conducted to reveal patterns and evolution in the field. This provides valuable insights for both theory and practical applications. Overall, the study concludes that scholarly contributions to scientific research and publication help to address research gaps and expand knowledge in this field. Understanding the evolution of intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media can support future research that contributes to the development of more effective and sustainable solutions to this persistent problem.</description>

      <title>Participatory design: A systematic review and insights for future practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory Design -- an iterative, flexible design process that uses the close involvement of stakeholders, most often end users -- is growing in use across design disciplines. As an increasing number of practitioners turn to Participatory Design (PD), it has become less rigidly defined, with stakeholders engaged to varying degrees through the use of disjointed techniques. This ambiguous understanding can be counterproductive when discussing PD processes. Our findings synthesize key decisions and approaches from design peers that can support others in engaging in PD practice. We investigated how scholars report the use of Participatory Design in the field through a systematic literature review. We found that a majority of PD literature examined specific case studies of PD (53 of 88 articles), with the design of intangible systems representing the most common design context (61 of 88 articles). Stakeholders most often participated throughout multiple stages of a design process (65 of 88 articles), recruited in a variety of ways and engaged in several of the 14 specific participatory techniques identified. This systematic review provides today's practitioners synthesized learnings from past Participatory Design processes to inform and improve future use of PD, attempting to remedy inequitable design by engaging directly with stakeholders and users.</description>

      <title>Disruption and recovery of the US domestic airline networks during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious impacts on the airline industry. Ensuring that aviation policies in emergent situations both guarantee network connectivity and maintain competition among airlines is crucial in these circumstances. To this end, we aimed to understand the network dynamics of individual airlines. In this study, we quantitatively reveal the day-to-day dynamics of these US domestic airline networks, comprising 17 airlines, from January 2019 to December 2021. Specifically, we applied a framework for analyzing temporal networks, in which the network structure changes over time. We found that, first, even though the number of nodes and edges returned to pre-pandemic levels around July 2021, the structure of the entire US domestic airline network remained altered. We also found that the network dynamics varied significantly from airline to airline. Full-service carriers were less flexible in changing their network structure and suffered higher revenue losses. On the contrary, most regional carriers completely shifted to a new structure, which may have contributed to reducing their revenue losses. Low-cost carriers were characterized by more pronounced differences between airlines and drastically changed their network structure immediately after the declaration of a national emergency. Finally, we also examined the recovery process and found that the flights connecting airports that are more central and share more common neighbors, and those connecting airports with larger numbers of connections tend to recover earlier for most of the airlines.</description>

      <title>Delay propagation patterns in Japan's domestic air transport network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experience air traffic delays every day, but are there any recurrent patterns in these delays? In this study, we investigate the recurrence of delay propagation patterns in Japan's domestic air transport network in 2019 by integrating delay causality networks and temporal network analysis. Additionally, we examine characteristics unique to delay propagation by comparing delay causality networks with corresponding randomized networks generated by a directed configuration model. As a result, we found that the structure of the delay propagation patterns can be classified into several groups. The identified groups exhibit statistically significant differences in total delay time and average out-degree, with different airports playing central roles in spreading delays. The results also suggest that some delay propagation patterns are particularly prominent during specific times of the year, which could be influenced by Japan's seasonal and geographical factors. Moreover, we discovered that specific network motifs appear significantly more (or less) frequently in delay causality networks than their corresponding randomized counterparts. This characteristic is particularly pronounced in groups with more significant delays. These results suggest that delays propagate following specific directional patterns, which could significantly contribute to predicting air traffic delays. We expect the present study to trigger further research on recurrent and non-recurrent natures of air traffic delay propagation.</description>

Abstract: Language models are known to hallucinate incorrect information, and it is unclear if they are sufficiently accurate and reliable for use in scientific research. We developed a rigorous human-AI comparison methodology to evaluate language model agents on real-world literature search tasks covering information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection tasks. We show that PaperQA2, a frontier language model agent optimized for improved factuality, matches or exceeds subject matter expert performance on three realistic literature research tasks without any restrictions on humans (i.e., full access to internet, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 writes cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than existing, human-written Wikipedia articles. We also introduce a hard benchmark for scientific literature research called LitQA2 that guided design of PaperQA2, leading to it exceeding human performance. Finally, we apply PaperQA2 to identify contradictions within the scientific literature, an important scientific task that is challenging for humans. PaperQA2 identifies 2.34 +/- 1.99 contradictions per paper in a random subset of biology papers, of which 70% are validated by human experts. These results demonstrate that language model agents are now capable of exceeding domain experts across meaningful tasks on scientific literature.</description>
