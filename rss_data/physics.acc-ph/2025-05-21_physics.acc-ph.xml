      <title>Experimental demonstration of a tomographic 5D phase-space reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed knowledge of particle-beam properties is of great importance to understand and push the performance of existing and next-generation particle accelerators. We recently proposed a new phase-space tomography method to reconstruct the five-dimensional (5D) phase space, i.e., the charge density distribution in all three spatial directions and the two transverse momenta. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of the method at the FLASHForward facility at DESY. This includes the reconstruction of the 5D phase-space distribution of a GeV-class electron bunch, the use of this measured phase space to create a particle distribution for simulations, and the extraction of the transverse 4D slice emittance.</description>

      <title>Space Charge in Circular Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space charge forces, which arise directly from the beam's charge distribution and include the influence of image charges and currents induced by interactions with a perfectly conducting, smooth pipe, are very important in high-intensity, low-energy accelerators. These forces play a key role under various beam dynamics regimes, leading to effects such as energy spread, modifications of betatron tunes, and potential instabilities. This lecture will explore the fundamental characteristics of space charge effects in circular accelerators.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in Linear Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a charged particle beam moves through perfectly conducting structures with varying cross-sectional boundaries - such as RF cavities, tapers, bellows, kickers, ... - it induces both longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic fields called wakefields. In this lecture, we explore the fundamental characteristics of wakefields and illustrate key concepts using simple cases in cylindrical geometry, including a perfectly conducting pipe and the resonant modes of an RF cavity. Finally, we examine how wakefields influence beam dynamics in a LINAC, focusing on beam breakup instabilities and potential mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>The SPARTA project: toward a demonstrator facility for multistage plasma acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma accelerators promise greatly reduced size and cost for future particle-accelerator facilities. However, several challenges remain to be solved; in particular that of coupling beams between plasma stages (i.e., staging) without beam-quality degradation, and that of ensuring a stable acceleration process. In order to mature the technology, it is also key to identify an application that requires staging and high stability but is not overly challenging in other parameters such as energy efficiency, beam quality and repetition rate. The goal of the ERC-funded project SPARTA is to solve the staging and stability problems of plasma acceleration, and to combine the solutions into a medium-scale multistage plasma-accelerator facility for such an application: experiments in strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Here, we discuss the three main objectives of the SPARTA project: developing a nonlinear plasma lens for staging, developing self-stabilization mechanisms, and providing a conceptual design for a multistage demonstrator facility.</description>
