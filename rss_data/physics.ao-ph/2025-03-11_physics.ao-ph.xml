      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Enhanced Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity prediction is crucial for mitigating storm hazards, yet its complex dynamics pose challenges to traditional methods. Here, we introduce a Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PIR-NODE) model to precisely forecast TC intensity evolution. This model leverages the powerful non-linear fitting capabilities of deep learning, integrates residual connections to enhance model depth and training stability, and explicitly models the continuous temporal evolution of TC intensity using Neural ODEs. Experimental results in the SHIPS dataset demonstrate that the PIR-NODE model achieves a significant improvement in 24-hour intensity prediction accuracy compared to traditional statistical models and benchmark deep learning methods, with a 25. 2\% reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) and a 19.5\% increase in R-square (R2) relative to a baseline of neural network. Crucially, the residual structure effectively preserves initial state information, and the model exhibits robust generalization capabilities. This study details the PIR-NODE model architecture, physics-informed integration strategies, and comprehensive experimental validation, revealing the substantial potential of deep learning techniques in predicting complex geophysical systems and laying the foundation for future refined TC forecasting research.</description>

      <title>Advanced Ocean Reanalysis of the Northwestern Atlantic: 1993-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 30-year high-resolution Northwestern Atlantic Ocean Reanalysis (NAOR) is presented. NAOR spans from January 1993 to December 2022 with a 4 km horizontal resolution and 50 vertical layers. It provides enhanced resolution and expands the spatial and temporal coverage of existing ocean reanalysis in the region. NAOR was conducted using the Regional Ocean Modeling System along with Ensemble Optimal Interpolation data assimilation. Open boundary and surface forcing conditions were obtained from GLORYS global ocean reanalysis and ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Multiple sources of satellite and in-situ observations were incorporated through the data assimilation. Additionally, major rivers were accounted for to include freshwater riverine discharge. NAOR was extensively evaluated against available independent observations. Spatio-temporal variations of mesoscale circulation, eddies, and boundary currents are well captured. Compared to GLORYS, NAOR offers a more accurate physical and dynamic baseline of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, which can be utilized for a range of marine and environmental studies as well as climate impact research.</description>

      <title>European supercell thunderstorms -- an underestimated current threat and an increasing future hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercell thunderstorms are the most hazardous thunderstorm category and particularly impactful to society. Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, a first-of-its-kind characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe is derived for the current and a warmer climate. Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.</description>

      <title>Diminishing Waters: The Great Salt Lake's Desiccation and Its Mental Health Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how the desiccation of Utah Great Salt Lake GSL, exacerbated by anthropogenic changes, poses significant health risks, particularly communities mental health. Reduced water inflow has exposed the lakebed, increasing airborne particulate matter PM2.5 and dust storms, which impact air quality. By integrating diverse datasets spanning from 1980 to present including insitu measurements, satellite imagery, and reanalysis products this study synthesizes hydrological, atmospheric, and epidemiological variables to comprehensively track the extent of the GSL surface water, local air quality fluctuations, and their effects on community mental health. The findings indicate a clear relationship between higher pollution days and more severe depressive symptoms. Specifically, individuals exposed to 22 days with PM2.5 levels above the World Health Organizations 24 hour guideline of 15 ug per m3 were more likely to experience severe depressive symptoms. Our results also suggest that people experiencing more severe depression not only face a higher number of high pollution days but also encounter such days more frequently. The study highlights the interconnectedness of poor air quality, environmental degradation and mental health emphasizing the need for more sustainable economic growth in the region.</description>

      <title>On the prediction of underwater aerodynamic noise of offshore wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for offshore wind energy has led to a significant increase in wind turbine size and to the development of large-scale wind farms, often comprising 100 to 150 turbines. However, the environmental impact of underwater noise emissions remains largely unaddressed. This paper quantifies, for the first time, the underwater aerodynamic noise footprint of three large offshore turbines (5 MW, 10 MW, and 22 MW) and wind farms composed of these turbines. We propose a novel methodology that integrates validated wind turbine noise prediction techniques with plane wave propagation theory in different media, enabling turbine designers to predict and mitigate underwater noise emissions. Our results confirm that aerodynamic noise from offshore wind farms presents a potential environmental challenge, with negative effects on marine life. Addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring the sustainable expansion of offshore wind energy.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the ``return stroke''-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.
