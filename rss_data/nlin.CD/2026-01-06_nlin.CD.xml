      <title>Chimera States in Wheel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How higher-order interactions influence dynamical behavior in networks of coupled chaotic oscillators remains an open question. To address this, we investigate emergent dynamical behaviors in a wheel network of R\"ossler and Lorenz oscillators that incorporates both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions under three coupling schemes, namely, diffusive, conjugate, and mean-field diffusive coupling. Our numerical analysis reveals four distinct collective behaviors: synchronization, desynchronization, chimera states, and synchronized clusters. To systematically classify these dynamical behaviors, we introduce two statistical measures that effectively capture synchronization patterns among arbitrarily positioned nodes. Applying these measures across all dynamical models and coupling schemes (six different models in total), we show that both pairwise and higher-order interactions crucially influence the emergence and robustness of chimera states. We observe that under pairwise interaction alone, chimera states appear with high prevalence in specific coupling ranges, though the robustness depends on both the coupling scheme and the underlying dynamical system. Incorporation of higher-order interactions reveals that the higher-order interaction underlying diffusive coupling enhances chimera states in both R\"ossler and Lorenz networks; under conjugate coupling, it strengthens chimera states in Lorenz but instead promotes full synchronization in R\"ossler; and under mean-field diffusive coupling, higher-order interactions generally favor synchronization, particularly for R\"ossler oscillators, but promote chimera in the Lorenz system for the intermediate range of its strengths. Overall, our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions can significantly modulate, promote, or suppress chimera states depending on the coupling mechanism and oscillator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identifying recurrent flows in high-dimensional dissipative chaos from low-dimensional embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are the non-chaotic, dynamical building blocks of spatio-temporal chaos, motivating a first-principles based theory for turbulence ever since the discovery of deterministic chaos. Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.</description>

      <title>Programmable ultra-broadband photonic chaos platform enabled by microwave-chaos-driven electro-optic frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical chaos holds great promise for secure communication, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning. However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable "chaos-on-comb" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86. Our work paves the way toward programmable, reconfigurable, and application-ready photonic chaos systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Synchronization in Financial Leverages Dynamics: Modeling Systemic Risk with Coupled Unimodal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic financial risk refers to the simultaneous failure or destabilization of multiple financial institutions, often triggered by contagion mechanisms or common exposures to shocks. In this paper, we present a dynamical model of bank leverage (the ratio of asset holdings to equity) a quantity that both reflects and drives risk dynamics. We model how banks, constrained by Value-at-Risk (VaR) regulations, adjust their leverage in response to changes in the price of a single asset, assumed to be held in fixed proportion across banks. This leverage-targeting behavior introduces a procyclical feedback loop between asset prices and leverage. In the dynamics, this can manifest as logistic-like behavior with a rich bifurcation structure across model parameters. By analyzing these coupled dynamics in both isolated and interconnected bank models, we outline a framework for understanding how systemic risk can emerge from seemingly rational micro-level behavior.</description>

      <title>Global Phase Synchronization Decoupled from Amplitude Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is a canonical framework for analyzing phase synchronization, yet its utility is restricted to the vicinity of the oscillator's unperturbed limit cycle. Here, we present a method to construct coupled-oscillator models that globally preserve Kuramoto-type phase dynamics by using phase-amplitude coordinates defined via Koopman operator theory. We introduce a solvable model, termed Kuramoto-Stuart-Landau model, which exhibits nontrivial synchronized dynamics far from the limit cycle. We also construct three phase synchronized oscillators whose amplitudes exhibit Lorenz-type chaos. Our method is applicable to general limit-cycle systems, achieving phase synchronization globally while preserving arbitrarily complex amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient recurrence quantification analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a widely used tool for studying complex dynamical systems, but its standard implementation requires computationally expensive calculations of recurrence plots (RPs) and line length histograms. This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts.</description>

      <title>Linearly-scalable and entropy-optimal learning of nonstationary and nonlinear manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Entropy-Optimal Manifold Clustering (EOMC) - and show that it mitigates the cost scaling and robustness issues of the existing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning tools in nonstationary and nonlinear situations, while pertaining the favourable O(T) iteration complexity scaling in the statistics size T, and allowing explicit computation of input data reliability. Application to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system in chaotic regime, as well as to a modified Hasegawa-Wakatani (mHW) model of drift-wave turbulence in the edge of a tokamak plasma reveals that for both of the models their essential dynamics is best described as a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent low-dimensional manifolds. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 and mHW output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others). These findings open new exciting opportunities for EOMC and transfer operator theory, by offering new possibilities to significantly improve predictive skills and performance of data-driven tools in fluid mechanics and geosciences applications.</description>

      <title>Identification of fixations and saccades in eye-tracking data using adaptive threshold-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.</description>
