      <title>Some new results on $\Delta$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space $X$ is a $\Delta$-space (or $X \in \Delta$) if for any decreasing sequence $\{A_n : n &lt; \omega\}$ of subsets of $X$ with empty intersection there is a (decreasing) sequence $\{U_n : n &lt; \omega\}$ of open sets with empty intersection such that $A_n \subset U_n$ for all $n &lt; \omega$. In this note we prove the following results concerning $\Delta$-spaces.
  1) Every $T_3$ countably compact $\Delta$-space is compact.
  2) If there is a $T_1$ crowded Baire $\Delta$-space then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal.
  3) If $X \in \Delta$ and $cf \big(o(X) \big) &gt; \omega$ then $|X| &lt; o(X)$. (Here $o(X)$ is the number of open subsets of $X$.)
  The first two of these provide full and/or partial solutions to problems raised in the literature, while the third improves a known result.</description>

      <title>Group topologies on groups of bi-absolutely continuous homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group of homeomorphisms of the closed interval that are absolutely continuous and have an absolutely continuous inverse was shown by Solecki to admit a natural Polish group topology $\tau_{ac}$. We show that, under mild conditions on a compact space endowed with a finite Borel measure such a topology can be defined on the subgroup of the homeomorphism group consisting of those elements $g$ such that $g$ and $g^{-1}$ preserve the class of null sets. We use a probabilistic argument to show that in the case of a compact topological manifold equipped with an Oxtoby-Ulam measure, as well as in that of the Cantor space endowed with some natural Borel measures there is no group topology between $\tau_{ac}$ and the restriction $\tau_{co}$ of the compact-open topology. In fact, we show that any separable group topology strictly finer than $\tau_{co}$ must be also finer than $\tau_{ac}$. For one-dimensional manifolds we also show that $\tau_{co}$ and $\tau_{ac}$ are the only Hausdorff group topologies coarser than $\tau_{ac}$, and one can read our result as evidence for the non-existence of a good notion of regularity between continuity and absolute continuity. We also show that while Solecki's example is not Roelcke precompact, the group of bi-absolutely continuous homeomorphisms of the Cantor space endowed with the measure given by the Fr\"aiss\'e limit of the class of measured boolean algebras with rational probability measures is Roelcke precompact.</description>

      <title>Smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema and constructing natural functions of the class on connected sums of manifolds admitting these functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
