      <title>Broadband High-Temperature Multilayer Pyramid-Shaped Metamaterial Thermal Absorber for Thermophotovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broadband, thermally stable absorber is essential for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems to simultaneously convert solar and industrial waste heat into usable energy to meet growing power demands. Here, we proposed an ingenious polarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer metamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture with almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six structures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and the materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent delamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied at room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which illustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till 5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric thicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure exhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles irrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the finite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated temperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around 1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent deformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further analyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly absorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined the effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the system efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber.</description>

      <title>Holographic lasing with dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-emitting metasurfaces provide a compact, integrated solution for simultaneous light generation and beam shaping, making them a promising candidate for advanced photonic applications. However, existing approaches for tailoring far-field emission patterns primarily operate in the spontaneous emission regime, where low coherence limits precise light control. Here, we present a light-emitting metasurface system with holographic lasing output, composed of a binary-structured metasurface integrated with a gain medium, that enables coherent light generation and precise beam shaping of the output lasing emission. With a compact footprint, low lasing threshold, and wide field of view, our system offers an exceptional platform for generating arbitrarily-structured lasing light, with significant potential for miniaturized optical systems.</description>

      <title>Subdiffraction confinement and non-diffractive propagation of optical Stokes skyrmions enabled by a super-oscillatory metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Stokes skyrmions have garnered extensive interest due to their intrinsic topological robustness and potential in informatics.However, most research remains confined to paraxial, low-numerical-aperture (low-NA) regimes, where their large transverse dimensions restrict broader applications.Under high-NA focusing, the polarization texture typically degrades or transforms abruptly as the beam traverses the focal region, hindering topology-preserving transport.In this work, we propose a strategy to generate a skyrmion needle field that maintains both subdiffraction confinement and non-diffractive propagation under high-NA conditions, thus preserving their topological characteristsics. Leveraging the polarization invariance of conventional optical needles, we realize the Stokes skyrmion needle using a single plasmonic metalens,designed to function as both a polarization filter and a super-resolving focusing element.Experimental and simulation results verify non-diffractive propagation over an extended depth of focus (up to 5 lambda), while the Stokes-vector texture retained at subdiffraction scales throughout propagation. This skyrmion needle not only addresses previous propagation constraints but also opens new avenues for diffraction-unlimited information transport. Such skyrmion needles exhibit substantial potential in fields including light-matter interaction, optical metrology, and informatics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal optical circuit switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly switching optical signals outperforms conventional optoelectronic hardware in terms of cost, latency, and energy efficiency, and is expected to address the growing demand for data node capacity driven by the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore, optical circuit switching (OCS) technology has piqued widespread research interest in various technical solutions, including silicon photonics. However, silicon-based integrated OCS remains constrained by challenges such as network performance and port scalability. Here we propose a magneto-optical heterogeneous integrated nonreciprocal OCS (NOCS) network based on a silicon photonics platform, achieving bidirectional full-duplex nonreciprocal transmission by programming reciprocal and nonreciprocal phase shifters. We demonstrate that compared with the existing OCS architecture, NOCS has the advantages of ultra-high reconfiguration speed, large-scale integration compatibility, and bidirectional channel isolation reducing the number of required ports. NOCS could meet the programming speed requirements of the AI backend network, or supports nonreciprocal optical switching applications without multiplexing technology.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced symmetric second-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the two types of backward second-harmonic generation (SHG), symmetric SHG exhibits some physical characteristics and application prospects that are distinct from those of forward SHG. It is generally realized through quasi-phase matching, which imposes more stringent requirements on the poling period and thus presents challenges for domain engineering. Although employing larger poling periods can ease fabrication, it inevitably reduces conversion efficiency, a drawback that can be compensated by using a cavity. In this work, we employed a semi-monolithic cavity to enhance the efficiency of 7th-order symmetric SHG, achieving a measured one-sided conversion efficiency of 7.2 %, which corresponds to a theoretical total efficiency of 14.4 %. This represents an improvement of more than three orders of magnitude compared with the single-pass case. In addition, the nonlinear coefficient of the crystal of ${d_{33}} = 4.8$ $\rm pm/V$ was estimated.</description>

      <title>Fast and compact time-resolved spectroscopy enabled by Quantum Walk Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs paved the way for fast and compact multi-component optical chemical analysis due to their broadband spectra. Dual-comb spectrometers embody this technology, but their design requires a pair of matched combs, adding complexity to the system. In this study, we propose and implement a scheme for a rapid, compact spectroscopic analyser that operates without moving components, leveraging the tunability and speed of a single quantum walk comb laser. Previously, these combs have been shown to deliver stable, tunable and broadband lasing. Here, a single quantum cascade laser-based comb emitting within the significant molecular fingerprint region of the mid-infrared spectrum was employed in a non-interferometric setup for targeted and non-targeted analysis of various organic solvent vapours. With a time resolution as small as 10 microseconds and a high dynamic range reaching three orders of magnitude in concentration, this approach is suitable for the real-time analysis of chemical kinetics.</description>

      <title>Meso-chiral optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles: uncovering hidden chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chirality plays an important role in chemistry and biology, allows control of biological interactions, affects drugs efficacy and safety, and promotes synthesis of new materials. In general, chirality manifests itself in optical activity (circular dichroism or circular birefringence). Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have been recently developed for molecular enantiomer separation, chiral sensing and chiral photocatalysis. Here, we show that optical chirality of plasmonic nanoparticles exhibiting strong scattering can remain completely undetected using standard characterisation techniques, such as circular dichroism measurements. This phenomenon, which we term meso-chiral in analogy to meso-compounds in chemistry, is based on mutual cancellation of absorption and scattering chiral responses. As a prominent example, the meso-optical behaviour has been numerically demonstrated in multi-wound-SiO2/Au nanoparticles over the entire visible spectral range and in other prototypical chiral nanoparticles in narrower spectral ranges. The meso-chiral property has been experimentally verified by demonstrating chiral absorption of gold helicoid nanoparticles at the wavelength where conventional circular dichroism measurements show absence of chiral response (gext=0). These findings demonstrate a valuable link between microscopic to macroscopic manifestations of chirality and can provide insights for interpreting a wide range of experimental results and designing chiral properties of plasmonic nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Limits on Responsivity and SNR for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) have been suggested for ultra-sensitive sensing because the eigenfrequency splitting grows as the nth-root of a perturbation, suggesting divergent responsivity. In ideal linear devices, however, this responsivity gain is reconciled by a matching divergence in the quantum shot-noise floor, so the net signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged. Recent work has extended this argument to nonlinear devices, such as above-threshold lasers, predicting other divergences at an EP that is shifted by the interplay of noise and saturation effects. Here we analyze a system of two coupled saturable resonators and show analytically that a self-consistent treatment of fluctuation dynamics removes these divergences entirely. Islands of instability arise in the parameter space surrounding the EP due to the coupling of phase noise into the amplitude dynamics, dictating a maximum responsivity and maximum noise that can be experimentally observed. Stochastic Langevin simulations of the full nonlinear system corroborate our analytical results down to zero detuning.</description>

      <title>Unifying framework for non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology in driven-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal sensors.</description>

      <title>Black holes black out: total absorption in time-dependent scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.</description>

      <title>Steady state dynamics of quantum frequency combs in microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs are utilized in a wide range of optical applications, including atomic clocks, interferometers, and various sensing technologies. They are often generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in chip-integrated microring resonators, a method that requires low optical input power due to the high quality factor of the resonator, making it highly efficient. While the classical properties of optical frequency combs are well-established, this work investigates the quantum-mechanical characteristics of the individual comb modes. We derive simple equations describing the squeezing, second-order correlation and joint spectral intensity (JSI) between the generated signal and idler modes. Even with the resonator's detuning limiting the generation of signal- and idler pairs with significant photon numbers, many still exhibit substantial squeezing and entanglement. It is demonstrated that the design and dispersion characteristics of the ring resonator significantly impact the quantum features of the modes. Depending on the design, it is possible to enhance either the particle or mode entanglement of specific signal- and idler pairs. Thus, our findings enable the optimization for utilizing quantum frequency combs in various applications, including quantum sensing, computing and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarimetry and optical imaging techniques face challenges in photon-starved scenarios, where the low number of detected photons imposes a trade-off between image resolution, integration time, and sample sensitivity. Here we introduce a quantum-inspired method, functional classical shadows, for reconstructing a polarization profile in the low photon-flux regime. Our method harnesses correlations between neighbouring datapoints, based on the recent realisation that machine learning can estimate multiple physical quantities from a small number of non-identical samples. This is applied to the experimental reconstruction of polarization as a function of the wavelength. Although the quantum formalism helps structuring the problem, our approach suits arbitrary intensity regimes.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.</description>

      <title>High Clockrate Free-space Optical In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to process and act on data in real time is increasingly critical for applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, three-dimensional environmental sensing and remote robotics. However, the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in edge devices is hindered by the lack of energy-efficient scalable computing hardware. Here, we introduce a fanout spatial time-of-flight optical neural network (FAST-ONN) that calculates billions of convolutions per second with ultralow latency and power consumption. This is enabled by the combination of high-speed dense arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for input modulation with spatial light modulators of high pixel counts for in-memory weighting. In a three-dimensional optical system, parallel differential readout allows signed weight values accurate inference in a single shot. The performance is benchmarked with feature extraction in You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) for convolution at 100 million frames per second (MFPS), and in-system backward propagation training with photonic reprogrammability. The VCSEL transmitters are implementable in any free-space optical computing systems to improve the clockrate to over gigahertz. The high scalability in device counts and channel parallelism enables a new avenue to scale up free space computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Piezomechanical scattering loss in electro-optics quantum transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Weak anharmonicity sensing by single- and two-photon drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical cavity undergoes a quantum phase transition when the strength of a two-photon drive exceeds a critical point (CP), and the great sensitivity of CP in sensing has been recognized. However, these methodologies are customized to sense linear perturbations, and quantum noise is divergent at the CP. Here, we propose a scheme for sensing the weak Kerr nonlinearity in an optical cavity by both single- and two-photon drives, based on the CP for phase transition. We show that the mean photon number around the CP induced by the two-photon drive sensitively depends on the Kerr coefficient in the optical cavity, so that the weak anharmonicity in the optical cavity can be measured sensitively by detecting the mean photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the single-photon drive provides an effective way to suppress the quantum noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This scheme can be applied to detecting the weak nonlinear interactions in a wide range of optical systems.</description>

      <title>3D in-situ profiling in a laser micromachining station using dual-comb LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in laser micromachining is the complexity of the process development. The available monitoring capabilities are mostly limited to external measurement systems, significantly slowing down this step. We address this limitation by integrating a coaxial dual-comb LiDAR system directly into a laser micromachining station, enabling in-situ, non-destructive 3D profiling without removing the workpiece. The sub-micron raw axial precision of the system, the operation without mechanical delay scanning and a large working range make the system well-suited for profiling a large variety of micromachined structures. By providing in-situ feedback this approach will significantly accelerate laser micromachining process development.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving atomic resolution in electron microscopy has historically been hindered by spherical aberration, a fundamental limitation of conventional electron lenses. Its correction typically requires complex assemblies of electromagnetic multipoles. Here, we demonstrate that spherical aberration in a cylindrically symmetric electron lens can be fully compensated via interaction with a shaped light field. By analyzing distortions in high-magnification point-projection electron images of optical standing waves, we quantify the spherical aberration before and after light-induced correction. This approach introduces a new paradigm for optical control in electron beam shaping and opens a pathway towards compact and tunable light-based aberration correctors for high-resolution electron microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. In particular, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.</description>

      <title>Detection of the laser induced damage using a He Ne laser reflective imaging technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optically induced tunneling in narrow metallic gaps from the time dependent density functional perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle) optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon, and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic gaps under an applied dc bias.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing: A Paradigm for Optimization in an Open Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems could have a large positive impact on many real-world application areas, such as logistics. For this reason, significant efforts have been made to design novel optimisation paradigms. Here we show an early instance of such paradigm in an optical setting, the entropy computing paradigm. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses optical measurement and feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. We further propose a training algorithm with single-sample bit-scale optimization.</description>
