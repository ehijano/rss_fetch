      <title>No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schr\"{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Exotic Quantum States in Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensate with Spin-Orbit Coupling in Concentric Annular Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the exotic quantum states emerging in the ground state (GS) of a strongly-correlated spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in two-dimensional concentric annular traps with a spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical and horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase separation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study indicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via the interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant state variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Joule expansion of a quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures with the dynamic structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</description>
