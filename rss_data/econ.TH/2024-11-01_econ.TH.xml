      <title>Flexible Demand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple framework to analyze how targeted advertising interacts with market power. A designer chooses an advertising plan which allows it to flexibly manipulate the demand curve at some cost. A monopolist prices against this manipulated demand curve. We fully characterize the form and value of producer-optimal and consumer-optimal advertising plans under both ex-ante and ex-post measures of welfare. Flexibility is double-edged: producer-optimal plans substantially reduce consumer surplus vis-a-vis uniform advertising, but consumer-optimal plans can substantially improve consumer surplus. We discuss implications for the regulation of targeted advertising.</description>

      <title>New Combinatorial Insights for Monotone Apportionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apportionment problem constitutes a fundamental problem in democratic societies: How to distribute a fixed number of seats among a set of states in proportion to the states' populations? This--seemingly simple--task has led to a rich literature and has become well known in the context of the US House of Representatives. In this paper, we connect the design of monotone apportionment methods to classic problems from discrete geometry and combinatorial optimization and explore the extent to which randomization can enhance proportionality.
  We first focus on the well-studied family of stationary divisor methods, which satisfy the strong population monotonicity property, and show that this family produces only a slightly superlinear number of different outputs as a function of the number of states. While our upper and lower bounds leave a small gap, we show that--surprisingly--closing this gap would solve a long-standing open problem from discrete geometry, known as the complexity of $k$-levels in line arrangements. The main downside of divisor methods is their violation of the quota axiom, i.e., every state should receive $\lfloor q_i\rfloor$ or $\lceil q_i\rceil$ seats, where $q_i$ is the proportional share of the state. As we show that randomizing over divisor methods can only partially overcome this issue, we propose a relaxed version of divisor methods in which the total number of seats may slightly deviate from the house size. By randomizing over them, we can simultaneously satisfy population monotonicity, quota, and ex-ante proportionality.
  Finally, we turn our attention to quota-compliant methods that are house-monotone, i.e., no state may lose a seat when the house size is increased. We provide a polyhedral characterization based on network flows, which implies a simple description of all ex-ante proportional randomized methods that are house-monotone and quota-compliant.</description>

      <title>Fair Division of Chores with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fair allocation of indivisible chores to agents under budget constraints, where each chore has an objective size and disutility. This model captures scenarios where a set of chores need to be divided among agents with limited time, and each chore has a specific time needed for completion. We propose a budget-constrained model for allocating indivisible chores, and systematically explore the differences between goods and chores in this setting. We establish the existence of an EFX allocation. We then show that EF2 allocations are polynomial-time computable in general; for many restricted settings, we strengthen this result to EF1. For divisible chores, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing an EF allocation.</description>

      <title>Game Connectivity and Adaptive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity properties of their best-response graphs. Our central result shows that almost every game that is 'generic' (without indifferences) and has a pure Nash equilibrium and a 'large' number of players is connected, meaning that every action profile that is not a pure Nash equilibrium can reach every pure Nash equilibrium via best-response paths. This has important implications for dynamics in games. In particular, we show that there are simple, uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in almost every large generic game that has one (which contrasts with the known fact that there is no such dynamic that leads almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in every generic game that has one). We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our characterisation of game connectivity.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility function for monetary returns, that includes results on first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss. We also define a utility function for monetary returns that in a certain sense reconciles state-dependent constant average utility of money with loss aversion and the Friedman-Savage hypothesis. As an immediate consequence of such a utility function, we obtain a profile of state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, where states of nature correspond to mutually disjoint intervals in which monetary gains and losses may occur.</description>

      <title>Information Sharing with Social Image Concerns and the Spread of Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how social image concerns affect information sharing patterns between peers. An individual receives a signal ("news") about the state of the world and can either share it with a peer or not. This signal has two attributes: a headline -- e.g., arguing for or against human-induced climate change -- and a veracity status, indicating if the signal is based on facts or made-up. The headline is observable at no cost by everyone, while observing the veracity status is costly and the cost depends on an individual's type. We study the sharing patterns induced by two different types of social image concern: wanting to be perceived as talented, which implies being able to distinguish proper from fake news, and wanting to signal one's worldview. Our model can rationalize the empirical finding that fake news may be shared with a higher propensity than proper news (e.g., Vosoughi et al., 2018). We show that both a veracity and a worldview concern may rationalize this finding, though sharing patterns are empirically distinguishable and welfare implications differ.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Best-Response and Related Dynamics in Tullock Contests with Convex Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tullock contests model real-life scenarios that range from competition among proof-of-work blockchain miners to rent-seeking and lobbying activities. We show that continuous-time best-response dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agents' behavior in these games.</description>
