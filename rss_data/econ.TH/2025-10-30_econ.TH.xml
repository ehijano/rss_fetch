      <title>Learning to Unlearn: Education as a Remedy for Misspecified Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study education as a remedy for misspecified beliefs in a canonical sequential social-learning model. Uneducated agents misinterpret action histories - treating actions as if they were independent signals and, potentially, overstating signal precision - while educated agents use the correct likelihoods (and may also enjoy higher private precision). We define a misspecified-belief PBE and show existence with a simple structure: education is a cutoff in the realized cost and actions are threshold rules in a single log-likelihood index. A closed-form value-of-education statistic compares the accuracy of the educated versus uneducated decision at any history; this yields transparent conditions for self-education. When a misspecified process sustains an incorrect cascade, uniformly positive private value and a positive flip probability imply that education breaks the cascade almost surely in finite time, with an explicit bound on expected break time. We quantify welfare gains from making education available and show how small per-education subsidies sharply raise de-cascading probabilities and improve discounted welfare. Extensions cover imperfect observability of education choices and a planner who deploys history-dependent subsidies.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Persuasion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sender persuades a strategically naive decisionmaker (DM) by committing privately to an experiment. Sender's choice of experiment is unknown to the DM, who must form her posterior beliefs nonparametrically by applying some learning rule to an IID sample of (state, message) realizations.
  We show that, given mild regularity conditions, the empirical payoff functions hypo-converge to the full-information counterpart. This is sufficient to ensure that payoffs and optimal signals converge to the Bayesian benchmark.
  For finite sample sizes, the force of this "sampling friction" is nonmonotonic: it can induce more informative experiments than the Bayesian benchmark in settings like the classic Prosecutor-Judge game, and less revelation even in situations with perfectly aligned preferences. For many problems with state-independent preferences, we show that there is an optimal finite sample size for the DM. Although the DM would always prefer a larger sample for a fixed experiment, this result holds because the sample size affects sender's choice of experiment.
  Our results are robust to imperfectly informative feedback and the choice of learning rule.</description>

      <title>New methods to compensate artists in music streaming platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of measuring the popularity of artists in music streaming platforms and the ensuing methods to compensate them (from the revenues platforms raise by charging users). We uncover the space of popularity indices upon exploring the implications of several axioms capturing principles with normative appeal. As a result, we characterize several families of indices. Some of them are intimately connected to the Shapley value, the central tool in cooperative game theory. Our characterizations might help to address the rising concern in the music industry to explore new methods that reward artists more appropriately. We actually connect our families to the new royalties models, recently launched by Spotify and Deezer.</description>

      <title>Walrasian equilibria are almost always finite in number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the context of exchange economies defined by aggregate excess demand functions on the full open price simplex, the generic economy has a finite number of equilibria. Genericicity is proved also for critical economies and, in both cases, in the strong sense that it holds for an open dense subset of economies in the Whitney topology. We use the concept of finite singularity type from singularity theory. This concept ensures that the number of equilibria of a map appear only in finite number. We then show that maps of finite singularity type make up an open and dense subset of all smooth maps and translate the result to the set of aggregate excess demand functions of an exchange economy.
  Along the way, we extend the classical results of Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu to aggregate excess demand functions defined on the full open price simplex, rather than just compact subsets of the simplex.</description>

      <title>Dual-Channel Technology Diffusion: Spatial Decay and Network Contagion in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a dual-channel framework for analyzing technology diffusion that integrates spatial decay mechanisms from continuous functional analysis with network contagion dynamics from spectral graph theory. Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Multi-to -one dimensional and semi-discrete screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the monopolist's screening problem with a multi-dimensional distribution of consumers and a one-dimensional space of goods. We establish general conditions under which solutions satisfy a structural condition known as nestedness, which greatly simplifies their analysis and characterization. Under these assumptions, we go on to develop a general method to solve the problem, either in closed form or with relatively simple numerical computations, and illustrate it with examples. These results are established both when the monopolist has access to only a discrete subset of the one-dimensional space of products, as well as when the entire continuum is available. In the former case, we also establish a uniqueness result.</description>
