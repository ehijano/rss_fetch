      <title>Neutron emission from the photon-induced reactions in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraperipheral collisions are the source of various interesting phenomena based on photon-induced reactions. We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\alpha$, $\gamma$-rays in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies.
  We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which only part of photon energy $E_\gamma$ is changed into the excitation energy of the nucleus ($E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$) and compare its results with outcomes of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. The role of high photon energies for small neutron multiplicities is discussed. Emission of a small number of neutrons at high photon energies seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section of four- and five-neutron emission cross sections from first principles is rather demanding. The estimated emission of charged particles such as protons, deuterons and $\alpha$ is shortly discussed and confronted with very recent ALICE data, obtained with the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter.</description>

      <title>Impact of tensor forces on quasifission product yield distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory to study the 48Ca+249Bk and 48Ti+238U systems, taking into account the dependence on orientation for deformed nuclei and full range of impact parameters. By analyzing fragment distributions of neutron and proton numbers, we assess the influence of different isoscalar and isovector tensor coupling constants of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. The quasifission yield distributions of 48Ca + 249Bk collision system utilizing SLy5t and T31 parametrizations exhibit more pronounced spherical shell effects compared to those using SLy5, T44 and T62 sets. Furthermore, within each parametrization group, the distributions for SLy5t and T31 are closely aligned, as are those for SLy5, T44, and T62. Similarly, the yield distributions for the 48Ti + 238U system using SLy5t and T31 also reflect the more pronounced spherical shell effects relative to SLy5 and T62, while the charge distribution shows much better agreement with experimental results for the SLy5t and T62 parametrizations compared to SLy5 and T31. The yield distributions for the 48Ca+249Bk and 48Ti+238U systems, when compared across the SLy5, SLy5t, T31, T44, and T62 parametrizations, indicate that the influence of tensor forces on quasifission fragments is reflected in the prominence of shell effects. This influence appears to be sensitive only in specific regions within the isoscalar and isovector coupling constant parameter space. In the 48Ti + 238U system, the prominence of shell effects is manifested not only through shifts in peak positions but also through narrower yield distributions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nuclear momentum anisotropy based on intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate ultra-central collisions of prolate uranium-uranium nuclei at intermediate energies using the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck model to investigate the impact of momentum anisotropy on spatial geometric effects. By defining the quadrupole deformation parameter in momentum space $\beta_\text{p}$, we establish an ellipsoidal Fermi surface, aligning its rotational symmetry axis with the one in coordinate space. It is found that oblate momentum density enhances elliptic flow $v_2$, while prolate momentum density has the opposite effect, particularly pronounced in the outer, high transverse momentum $p_\text{t}$ region. Momentum anisotropy also causes differences in the initial momentum mean projection along the beam direction, with larger projections producing more pion mesons. Additionally, significant effects on mean square elliptic flow are observed in non-polarized collisions. We further examine the relationship between the $v_2$-$p_\text{t}$ slope and $\beta_\text{p}$, eliminating systematic errors through the two-system ratio. These findings provide important references for experimentalists in heavy-ion collisions and valuable feedback to theorists regarding nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Iterative solutions of the ATDHFB equations to determine the nuclear collective inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterative adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) method is developed within the framework of Skyrme density functional theory. The ATDHFB equation is solved iteratively to avoid explicitly calculating the stability matrix. The contribution of the time-odd mean fields to the ATDHF(B) moment of inertia is incorporated self-consistently, and the results are verified by comparing them with the dynamical cranking predictions. The inertia mass tensor is calculated with the density-derivative term evaluated by numerical differentiation.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the same satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes (f-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>"Nuclear thermometers" reveal the origin of the universal r-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resembling behaviour of giant dipole resonances built on ground and excited states supports the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and assigns giant dipole resonances as spectroscopic probes -- or ``nuclear thermometers'' -- to explore the cooling of the kilonova ejecta in neutron-star mergers down to the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid-neutron capture or r-process. In previous work, we found a slight energy increase in the giant dipole resonance built on excited states at the typical temperatures of $1.0\gtrapprox T\gtrapprox0.7$ MeV where seed nuclei are produced, before ongoing neutron capture. Crucial data are presented here supporting an enhanced symmetry energy at $T=0.51$ MeV (or $5.9\times 10^9$ K) -- where the r-process occurs -- that lowers the binding energy in the Bethe-Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and results in the close in of the neutron drip line. Ergo, providing an origin to the universality of elemental abundances by limiting the reaction network for r-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced symmetry energy away from the ground state is further supported by shell-model calculations of the nuclear electric dipole ({\sc E1}) polarizability -- inversely proportional to the symmetry energy -- as a result of the destructive contribution of the products of off-diagonal {\sc E1} matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ are still absent in the quark model.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the distribution of fireballs produced in heavy-ion collisions in the net-baryon number and argue that neither the Free-Quark Model (FQM) nor the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model can provide a comprehensive explanation of the distribution observed at the LHC. The concept of net-baryon number freezeout temperature is suggested and the role of sea quarks as a possible source of net-baryon number fluctuations is emphasized.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the possible existence of a strangeness $S=-3$, isospin $I=1$ pentaquark state $P_{sss}$ generated dynamically from the $\bar{K}\Xi$ interaction. We employ a unitarized scheme in coupled channels based on the chiral Lagrangian expanded up to next-to-leading order (NLO), and show that the inclusion of the NLO terms is crucial to provide the necessary attraction that favors the existence of such triply strange pentaquark. The $\bar{K}\Xi$ femtoscopic correlation functions are calculated as example of a possible experimental measurement in which a direct signal of the $P_{sss}$ state could be observed.</description>

Abstract: Exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been discovered in the past two decades. Investigations of these states can lead to deep understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. In this concise review, we focus on the productions of exotic hadrons in $pp$, $p\bar p$, and nuclear collisions. Experimental observations of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as prototypes of hadronic molecules, in heavy ion collisions will also be briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: The formation of the excited states $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) is investigated in the dissociation of $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ and $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ at the energy of 3.65 GeV per nucleon in the nuclear emulsion. The identification becomes possible by reconstructing the invariant mass from measurements of emission angles in the approximation of conservation of momentum per nucleon of the parent nucleus. The contribution of the decays $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) to the dissociation $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ is 11 and 19%, and in $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ it is - 20 and 30%, correspondingly.</description>

Abstract: This study re examines the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of neutron deficient (178 192Hg, 185 194Pb and 196 206Po) nuclei. The nuclear ground state properties and shape parameters were calculated using the Relativistic Mean Field model. Three different density dependent interactions were used in the calculation. Estimated shape parameters were later used within the framework of deformed proton-neutron quasi random phase approximations model, with a separable interaction, to calculate the GT strength distributions, half lives and branching ratios for these neutron deficient isotopes. It was concluded that half lives and GT strength distributions vary considerably with change in shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on freeze-out of light clusters at NICA energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.07645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the chemical freeze-out of light nuclear clusters for NICA energies of above 2 A GeV. On the one hand we use results from the low energy domain of about 35 A MeV, where medium effects have been shown to be important to explain experimental results. On the high energy side of LHC energies the statistical model without medium effects has provided results for the chemical freeze-out. The two approaches extrapolated to NICA energies show a discrepancy that can be attributed to medium effects and that for the deuteron/proton ratio amounts to a factor of about three. These findings underline the importance of a detailed investigation of light cluster production at NICA energies.</description>

      <title>The pervasiveness of shape coexistence in nuclear pair condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear shape coexistence for a wide range of even-even nuclides. By varying general pair condensates, which include Slater determinants as a limit but also allow for arbitrary pairing channels, we frequently find multiple coexisting mimina, and often more than two. This is consistent with recent experimental results. In order to measure general pairwise correlations beyond a simple Slater determinant, we introduce a novel entropy-like measure, which is smallest mid-shell and largest near shell closures; this is consistent with a picture of pairing-like behavior dominating near closed shells and deformation mid-shell. After surveying nuclides spanning from the $sd$ shell to nuclides between magic numbers 50 and 82, we focus on the six lightest nuclei with shape coexistence. Angular-momentum projected variational pair condensate (PVPC) calculations identify band structures, including two newly proposed coexisting bands in $^{26}$Si/Mg and $^{24}$Si/Ne. The PVPC results agree well with data, providing robust experimental support for the pervasiveness of coexistence in these light nuclei.</description>

      <title>An MLE-based analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Activation of momentum fluctuations in wave packet molecular dynamics: Impacts on momentum distributions of projectilelike fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics approaches use wave packets as nucleon wave functions to simulate the time evolution of nuclear reactions. It is crucial to activate the momentum fluctuation inherent in each wave packet so that it properly affects the time evolution. In the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, this has traditionally been done by splitting the wave packets, i.e., by introducing a random fluctuation to the wave packet center of each particle. The present work proposes an improved approach to activate the fluctuation in both the one-body mean-field propagation and the two-nucleon collision processes, consistently based on the gradual or sudden change of the degree of isolation, which is derived from the fragment number function used for the zero-point energy subtraction. This new method is applied to the 12C + 12C and 12C + p reactions at about 100 MeV/nucleon, focusing on the momentum distribution of the 11B fragments produced by one-proton removal from the 12C projectile. The results show that, with the momentum fluctuation suitably activated, the method correctly accounts for the recoil from the removed nucleon to the residue and the 11B momentum distribution is significantly improved, while without activating the fluctuation the distribution is too narrow compared to the experimental data. Furthermore, the AMD results indicate that the momentum distribution consists of two components; one is the high $P_z$ component with a small shift from the beam velocity, resulting from the simple removal of a proton after an energetic collision with a target particle; the other is the low $P_z$ component with a larger peak shift resulting from the decay of an excited 12C nucleus in a longer time scale. The activation of momentum fluctuation mainly affects the high $P_z$ component to broaden it. The role of cluster correlations in this problem is also investigated.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today due to the presence of experimental uncertainties. In fact, a purely kinematical triangle diagram is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements with a reasonably high accuracy of discrimination between the two seemingly identical line shapes. We also identify the type of triangle enhancement that can be misidentified as a dynamic pole structure. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a triangle singularity, but is more consistent with a pole-based interpretation, as determined solely through pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we explain how our method can be used as a model-selection framework useful in studying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>
