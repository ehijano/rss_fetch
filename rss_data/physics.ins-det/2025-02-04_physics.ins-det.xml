      <title>MAIA: A new detector concept for a 10 TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon colliders offer a compelling opportunity to explore the TeV scale and conduct precision tests of the Standard Model, all within a relatively compact geographical footprint. This paper introduces a new detector concept, MAIA (Muon Accelerator Instrumented Apparatus), optimized for $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV $\mu\mu$ collisions. The detector features an all-silicon tracker immersed in a 5T solenoid field. High-granularity silicon-tungsten and iron-scintillator calorimeters surrounding the solenoid capture high-energy electronic and hadronic showers, respectively, and support particle-flow reconstruction. The outermost subsystem comprises an air-gap muon spectrometer, which enables standalone track reconstruction for high-momentum muons. The performance of the MAIA detector is evaluated in terms of differential particle reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions. Beam-induced background (BIB) simulations generated in FLUKA are overlaid with single particle gun samples to assess detector reconstruction capabilities under realistic experimental conditions. Even with BIB, reconstruction efficiencies exceed 95% for energetic tracks, photons, and neutrons in the central region of the detector. This paper outlines promising avenues of future work, including forward region optimization and opportunities for enhanced flavor/boosted object tagging, and addresses the technological assumptions needed to achieve the desired detector performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Magnetic Evaporative Beamline Cooling for Preparation of Cold Atomic Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the endpoint of the beta spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved recoiling neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular (T$_{2}$) tritium sources. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and / or magnetic bottles for beta spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magneto-gravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique, and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.</description>

      <title>Dielectric nanotomography based on electrostatic force microscopy: A numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) can image nanoscale objects buried below the surface. Here, we theoretically show that this capability can be used to obtain nanotomographic information, i.e., the physical dimensions and dielectric properties, of buried nano-objects. These results constitute a first step toward implementing a nondestructive dielectric nanotomography technique based on EFM with applications in materials sciences and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Adjustable picometer-stable interferometers for testing space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), use picometer-precision laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves at frequencies from 1 Hz down to below 0.1 mHz. Laser interferometers used for on-ground prototyping and testing of such instruments are typically constructed by permanently bonding or gluing optics onto an ultra-stable bench made of low-expansion glass ceramic. This design minimizes temperature coupling to length and tilt, which dominates the noise at low frequencies due to finite temperature stability achievable in laboratories and vacuum environments. Here, we present the study of an alternative opto-mechanical concept where optical components are placed with adjustable and freely positionable mounts on an ultra-stable bench, while maintaining picometer length stability. With this concept, a given interferometer configuration can be realised very quickly due to a simplified and speed-up assembly process, reducing the realisation time from weeks or months to a matter of hours. We built a corresponding test facility and verified the length stability of our concept by measuring the length change in an optical cavity that was probed with two different locking schemes, heterodyne laser frequency stabilisation and Pound-Drever-Hall locking. We studied the limitations of both locking schemes and verified that the cavity length noise is below 1 pm/sqrt(Hz) for frequencies down to 3 mHz. We thereby demonstrate that our concept can simplify the testing of interferometer configurations and opto-mechanical components and is suitable to realise flexible optical ground support equipment for space missions that use laser interferometry, such as future space-based gravitational wave detectors and satellite geodesy missions.</description>

      <title>Split-gasket approach to the integration of electrical leads into diamond anvil cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and heat capacity measurements under pressure must reconcile the limited available space and complicated geometry of a high-pressure cell with the need for multiple electrical connections. One solution for diamond anvil cells is to use customized diamonds with deposited electrical leads. Here, we instead address the problem through a split-gasket approach, intended for diamond anvil cells at moderate pressures and low temperature. A key component is the use of a substrate with lithographically defined leads, which enables connections to components such as thermometer, heater, and/or sample within the confined sample volume of the cell. The design includes an elaborate BeCu gasket sandwich with a preparation method that ensures electrical contact integrity. Using this configuration, we bring 12 leads to within 100 $\mu$m of the center of the diamond anvil at a pressure of about 2 GPa, comparable to the pressure reached with a regular gasket, demonstrating the setup's capability for high-pressure experiments. The split-gasket approach may come at the cost of reduced maximum pressure, but brings versatility and reproducibility, and alleviates the experimental efforts of maintaining multiple electrical leads both intact and electrically isolated.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($142 \times 142~mm^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Spatial resolution and image noise with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. A numerical phantom, which consisted of multi-rod and uniform cylindrical activities (21 MBq in total), was simulated for 600 s. Regarding image reconstruction, results of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction) were compared with those of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. The TOF resolution should be 30 ps with half the efficiency to maintain a similar image noise to that of the 40 ps TOF with complete efficiency. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors was shown.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust model-independent test of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal: ANAIS-112 results with six years of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.</description>

      <title>Measurements of a LYSO crystal array from threshold to 100 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of ten custom-made high-homogeneity LYSO crystals. The investigation is motivated by the need for a compact, high-resolution, and fast electromagnetic calorimeter for a new rare pion decay experiment. Each $2.5\times 2.5 \times 18$ cm$^3$ crystal was first characterized for general light yield properties and then its longitudinal response uniformity and energy resolution were measured using low-energy gamma sources. The ten crystals were assembled as an array and subjected to a 30 - 100 MeV positron beam with excellent momentum definition. The energy and timing resolutions were measured as a function of energy, and the spatial resolution was determined at 70 MeV. An additional measurement using monoenergetic 17.6 MeV gammas produced through a p-Li resonance was later made after the photosensors used in positron testing were improved. As an example of the results, the energy resolution at 70 MeV of 1.52 $\pm$ 0.03% is more than two times better than reported results using previous generation LYSO crystals.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Quantum Yield of Silicon using Geiger-mode Avalanching Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum yield is crucial to the reconstruction of energy depositions in silicon at the eV scale. This work presents a new method for experimentally calculating quantum yield using vacuum UV-sensitive silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), which can be used to determine the probabilities that a UV photon absorbed in a silicon crystal will produce one, two, or three electron-hole pairs. Results are presented which fully constrain the distribution at photon energies up to 7.75eV. This method works by exploiting the saturation of photon detection efficiency which occurs when these devices are biased sufficiently high above their avalanche breakdown voltage. The measured quantum yield values are lower than those that have been previously reported by experimental data and modelling -- this is expected to impact the sensitivity of experiments searching for light dark matter through direct detection in semiconductors, and should also be taken into account when characterizing the performance of UV photodetectors with high quantum efficiency. Measurements have been taken using a Hamamatsu VUV4 and an FBK VUV-HD3 device, showing good agreements between devices, and at a range of temperatures from 163-233K. The validity of the method is assessed using supplementary measurements of absolute photon detection efficiency, and an additional novel method of measuring average quantum yield using DC current-voltage measurements of SiPMs is presented and used for corroboration.</description>

      <title>To the UCN source with pulsed filling of a trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the discussion of the possibility of creating UCN sources based on the principle of pulse accumulation (PA) in traps. The implementation of the PA principle would make it possible to create a source with a flux of UCN in a trap significantly exceeding the time average. The paper provides a comparative analysis of various approaches to the implementation of the idea of PA of UCN in traps remoted from the place of their generation. Based on this analysis, the concept of the UCN source, the creation of which is planned at the IBR-2M pulse reactor, was formulated. A distinctive feature of the designed source is a combination of several approaches to ensuring the pulsed structure of neutron bunches reaching the UCN trap. One of them is the deceleration of the pulsed flux of VCN using a resonant flipper, the second is the use of compensating time lenses.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Argon Concentration Assessment within Insulating Glass Units (IGUs) using Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) contribute significantly to energy loss among building envelopes, as they are responsible for approximately 30 to 50% of thermal transmission losses. To mitigate these losses, inert gases such as Argon are used within IGU spacers. The aging of IGUs cause decrease in Argon gas concentration, affecting their insulating properties. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the Argon concentration to maintain the insulating effectiveness of IGUs. Therefore, this study focuses on utilizing ultrasonic testing (UT) to develop a non-destructive and affordable methodology for assessing argon concentration within IGUs. The methodology is developed in four steps: (1) designing an experimental setup for creating accurate gas mixtures of Argon and air, and transferring the target gas mixtures to the IGU spacer; (2) performing ultrasonic tests on IGUs with 60kHz excitation frequency to generate UT waveforms; (3) performing a validation test of the proposed methodology to verify the accuracy and repeatability of results obtained from step 2; and (4) analyzing the ultrasonic waveforms to explore the correlation between UT properties and Argon concentration within IGU. The findings show that ultrasonic energy serves as the most effective UT feature for assessing Argon concentration within the IGU spacer, as evidenced by a strong correlation with an R-squared value exceeding 0.9 across all the UT measurements. This research introduces a user-friendly solution that enhances the ease of assessing Argon concentration within IGUs' spacers, thereby facilitating the monitoring of their operational performance. The proposed methodology for evaluating Argon concentration holds potential benefits for IGU manufacturers and researchers. Moreover, it serves as a valuable tool for improving quality control across the manufacturing, maintenance, and operational stages of IGUs.</description>
