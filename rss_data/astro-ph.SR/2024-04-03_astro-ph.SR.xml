      <title>Measuring White Dwarf Variability from Sparsely Sampled Gaia DR3 Multi-Epoch Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 d and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 min), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target sample, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 min eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>Exploring Substructure of the Near-Surface Shear Layer of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient of rotation in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun provides valuable insights into the dynamics associated with the solar activity cycle and the dynamo. Results obtained with global oscillation mode-splittings lack resolution near the surface, prompting the use of the local helioseismic ring-diagram method. While the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ring-analysis pipeline has been used previously for analyzing this layer, default pipeline parameters limit the accuracy of the near-surface gradients. To address these challenges, we fitted the flow parameters to power spectra averaged over one-year periods at each location, followed by additional averaging over 12 years. We find that the NSSL can be divided into three fairly distinct regions: a deeper, larger region with small shear, steepening towards the surface; a narrow middle layer with a strong shear, with a gradient approximately three times larger; and a layer very close to the surface, where the logarithmic gradient is close to zero but becomes steeper again towards the surface. The middle layer appears to be centered at 3 Mm, but the poor resolution in these layers implies that it is potentially located closer to the surface, around 1.5 Mm deep. While our analysis primarily focused on regions along the central meridian, we also investigated systematic errors at longitudes off the center. The east-west antisymmetric component of the gradient reveals a layer of substantial differences between east and west longitude around at 1.7 Mm, and the amplitude of the differences increases with longitude.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive X-ray analysis of the massive O-type binary HD93250 over two decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive star winds are known to be responsible for X-ray emission arising from wind plasma heated by the strong shocks up to the temperature of 10$^6$--10$^7$ K in case of colliding wind binaries. We have investigated thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission from the massive O-type star HD93250 to unveil its binary orbital parameters independently. To meet our goal, X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton has been analyzed, spanning over $\sim$19 years. Additionally, we analyzed NuSTAR observations of HD93250 taken at various epochs. We determined the variability time-scale of the X-ray emission to be 193.8$\pm$1.3\,d, in full agreement with the 194.3$\pm$0.4\,d period derived from the astrometric orbit. The X-ray spectrum of HD93250 is well explained by a three-temperature thermal plasma emission model with temperatures of 0.26, 1.0, and 3.3 keV. The resulting X-ray flux varies in compliance with the typical colliding wind emission from eccentric massive binaries where it enhances near periastron passage and decreases gradually close to apastron, proportionally with the inverse of the binary separation. The periastron-to-apastron X-ray emission ratio points to an eccentricity range of 0.20-0.25, once again in agreement with the previously determined astrometric orbit. Finally, we did not detect any hard X-ray emission attributable to non-thermal emission above 10 keV. Given the derived plasma temperature, the strong phase-locked variability and the significant over-luminosity in X-rays, we establish that the X-ray emission from HD93250 is dominated by the colliding-wind region. Our results lend support to the idea that X-ray time analysis of massive stars constitutes a relevant tool to investigate their multiplicity and extract relevant information on their basic orbital parameters, such as the period and the eccentricity, independently of any orbital solution derived from usual techniques.</description>

      <title>The first CCD photometric studies of the member eclipsing binary ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1 in the newly discovered young open cluster UBC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first CCD observations of an eclipsing binary, ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1, which is a member in the open star cluster UBC 188. The observations were taken by the 1.88 m telescope at the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory (KAO) in SDSS griz bands. The latest version of the Wilson- Devinney (W-D) code was employed for photometric analysis and light curve modeling of the eclipsing binary. The results indicate that the binary system is in an over-contact configuration. The mass of the primary star (M1) is determined to be 1.293 Msun, and the mass of the secondary star (M2) is directly derived from the system's estimated mass ratio (q= M2/M1) as 0.340 times the solar mass (Msun). We investigated the color-magnitude diagram and the membership probability of the open cluster UBC 188 using the Gaia DR3 data. We determined the membership probability of the eclipsing binary ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1 using the pyUPMASK algorithm and found that its membership probability is one.</description>

      <title>Full orbital solutions in pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems: GG Tau Ab and UX Tau B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order multiple (triple and beyond) systems are relatively common. Their interaction with circumstellar and circumbinary material can have a large impact on the formation and evolution of planetary systems and depends on their orbital properties. GG\,Tau and UX\,Tau are two pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems in which the tightest pair has a projected separation of $\approx5$--20\,au. Characterizing precisely their orbits is crucial to establish their long-term stability, to predict the dynamics and evolution of circumstellar matter, and to evaluate the potential for planet formation in such systems. We combine existing astrometric measurements with previously unpublished high-resolution observations of the GG\,Tau\,Ab and UX\,Tau\,B pairs and perform Keplerian orbital fits. For GG\,Tau\,Ab the data presented here represent the first detection of orbital motion. For both systems they yield dramatic increases in orbital coverage ($\gtrsim60\%$ and $\approx100\%$ for UX\,Tau\,B and GG\,Tau\,Ab, for orbital periods of $\approx32$ and $\approx8$\,yr, respectively) and allow us to obtain well-constrained orbital fits, including dynamical masses with $\lesssim10\%$ and $\lesssim7\%$ random and systematic uncertainties. We find that both GG\,Tau\,A and UX\,Tau\,A--B likely form stable hierarchical systems, although one possible deprojection solution for GG\,Tau is strongly misaligned and could experience von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations. We further find that the UX\,Tau\,B orbit is much more eccentric than the GG\,Tau\,Ab one, possibly explaining the lack of circumstellar material in the former. The newly-determined orbits revive the question of the dynamical fate of gas and dust in these two hierarchical systems and should spur new dedicated simulations to assess the long-term evolution of the systems and the dynamical perturbations imposed by the close binaries they host.</description>

      <title>Solar synthetic imaging: Introducing denoising diffusion probabilistic models on SDO/AIA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the rarity of significant solar flares compared to smaller ones, training effective machine learning models for solar activity forecasting is challenging due to insufficient data. This study proposes using generative deep learning models, specifically a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), to create synthetic images of solar phenomena, including flares of varying intensities. By employing a dataset from the AIA instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft, focusing on the 171 {\AA} band that captures various solar activities, and classifying images with GOES X-ray measurements based on flare intensity, we aim to address the data scarcity issue. The DDPM's performance is evaluated using cluster metrics, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and F1-score, showcasing promising results in generating realistic solar imagery. We conduct two experiments: one to train a supervised classifier for event identification and another for basic flare prediction, demonstrating the value of synthetic data in managing imbalanced datasets. This research underscores the potential of DDPMs in solar data analysis and forecasting, suggesting further exploration into their capabilities for solar flare prediction and application in other deep learning and physical tasks.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Investigation of the Neupert Effect in Solar Flares Observed with ASO-S/HXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neupert effect refers to the strong correlation between the soft X-ray (SXR) light curve and the time-integrated hard X-rays (HXR) or microwave flux, which is frequently observed in solar flares. In this article, we therefore utilized the newly launched Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory to investigate the Neupert effect during solar flares. By checking the HXR light curves at 20-50 keV, a sample of 149 events that cover the flare impulsive phase were selected. Then, we performed a cross-correlation analysis between the HXR fluence (i.e., the time integral of the HXR flux) and the SXR 1-8 A flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. All the selected flares show high correlation coefficients (&gt;0.90), which seem to be independent of the flare location and class. The HXR fluences tend to increase linearly with the SXR peak fluxes. Our observations indicate that all the selected flares obey the Neupert effect.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Legacy survey of Class 0/I disks in Corona australis, Aquila, chaMaeleon, oPhiuchus north, Ophiuchus, Serpens (CAMPOS). I. Evolution of Protostellar disk radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I &amp; II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1". This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two Flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 40 au decreases with the protostellar evolutionary stage. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. We find that Class 0 dust disk size resembled the gas disk size, enabling a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.</description>

      <title>New Herbig-Haro Objects associated with Embedded Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to present the results of the Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). The main goal of this survey is to search for Herbig-Haro (HH) objects and jets in Galactic dark clouds. In this work we present the results of the search in the vicinity of infrared sources that are bright in the WISE survey and embedded in the dark clouds. The survey is performed with the 1 m Schmidt telescope of Byurakan Observatory, lately equipped with a new CCD detector, which allows to obtain one square degree images of the sky in various filters. Narrow-band filters were used to obtain Halpha and [S II] images, and a medium-width filter was used for the continuum imaging. New HH flows and knots were found near six embedded IR sources, which constitutes a significant proportion of the objects observed. At least two of the newly found HH flows (HH 1226 and HH 1227) lie in isolated dark clouds, thus pointing to active star formation in these regions. Other flows are also located in detached and dense globules or filaments. The length of the HH 1228 flow is about 1 pc; it has also a molecular hydrogen counterpart of the same extension. Coordinates, charts, detailed descriptions and distance estimates are provided. The lower limits of bolometric luminosities of the source stars are typical for low-mass young stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric differential imaging with VLT/NACO. A comprehensive PDI pipeline for NACO data (PIPPIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed diversity of exoplanets can possibly be traced back to the planet formation processes. Planet-disk interactions induce sub-structures in the circumstellar disk that can be revealed via scattered light observations. However, a high-contrast imaging technique such as polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) must first be applied to suppress the stellar diffraction halo. In this work we present the PDI PiPelIne for NACO data (PIPPIN), which reduces the archival polarimetric observations made with the NACO instrument at the Very Large Telescope. Prior to this work, such a comprehensive pipeline to reduce polarimetric NACO data did not exist. We identify a total of 243 datasets of 57 potentially young stellar objects observed before NACO's decommissioning. The PIPPIN pipeline applies various levels of instrumental polarisation correction and is capable of reducing multiple observing setups, including half-wave plate or de-rotator usage and wire-grid observations. A novel template-matching method is applied to assess the detection significance of polarised signals in the reduced data. In 22 of the 57 observed targets, we detect polarised light resulting from a scattering of circumstellar dust. The detections exhibit a collection of known sub-structures, including rings, gaps, spirals, shadows, and in- or outflows of material. Since NACO was equipped with a near-infrared wavefront sensor, it made unique polarimetric observations of a number of embedded protostars. This is the first time detections of the Class I objects Elia 2-21 and YLW 16A have been published. Alongside the outlined PIPPIN pipeline, we publish an archive of the reduced data products, thereby improving the accessibility of these data for future studies.</description>

      <title>Core to ultracompact HII region evolution in the W49A massive protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify and characterize cores in the high-mass proto-cluster W49, determine their evolutionary stages and measure the associated lifetimes. We built a catalog of 129 cores extracted from an ALMA 1.3 mm continuum image at 0.26" (2900 au) angular resolution. The association between cores and Hyper/Ultra Compact HII (H/UC HII) regions was established from the analysis of VLA 3.3 cm continuum and H30$\alpha$ line observations. We also looked for emission of hot molecular cores (HMCs) using the methyl formate doublet at 218.29 GHz. We identified 40 cores associated with an H/UC HII region and 19 HMCs over the ALMA mosaic. The 52 cores with an H/UC HII region and/or a HMC are assumed to be high-mass protostellar cores, while the rest of the core population likely consists in prestellar cores and low-mass protostellar cores. We found a good agreement between the two tracers of ionized gas, with 23 common detections and only four cores detected at 3.3 cm and not in H30$\alpha$. The spectral indexes from 3.3 cm to 1.3 mm range from 1, for the youngest cores with partially optically thick free-free emission, to about -0.1, that is optically thin free-free emission obtained for cores likely more evolved. Using as a reference the H/UC HII regions, we found the statistical lifetimes of the HMC and massive protostellar phases in W49N to be about $6\times10^4$ yr and $1.4\times10^5$ yr, respectively. We also showed that HMC can co-exist with H/UC HII regions during a short fraction of the core lifetime, about $2\times10^4$ yr. This indicates a rapid dispersal of the inner molecule envelope once the HC HII is formed.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: II. the ACA 1.3 mm continuum source catalog and the assembly of dense gas in massive star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the high resolution, high sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for "Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16-84 percentile values of 6-160 $M_{\odot}$), gravity-dominated ($M\propto R^{1.1}$) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ($\mathcal{M}&gt;1$) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering the fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio ($L/M$), we find that the DGF increases significantly with $L/M$, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by dynamic global collapse process.</description>

      <title>A fast-rotating blue straggler star in the tidal tail of the open cluster NGC 752</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 752 is a famous Galactic open cluster of intermediate age. In recent works, a very long and asymmetric tail was newly revealed. A blue straggler star (BSS) at the periphery of the tidal tail of the cluster has been identified subsequently. We aim to perform a detailed analysis of the newly detected BSS based on the available comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric data. We also explored this BSS's possible formation pathway and age limitation based on the collected spectroscopic and photometric data. We estimated the projected rotational velocity $v\ \mathrm{sin}i$ and the mass of the BSS from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra and multiband photometric data from various catalogs, respectively. The newly discovered BSS is confirmed as a genuine member of NGC 752. The lack of ultraviolet excess in the SED and no significant variations in the light curve imply that this BSS is likely a single star ($mass=1.86^{+3.62}_{-0.94}\ M_{\odot}$) formed through stellar mergers. The fast rotation velocity ($v\ \mathrm{sin}i=206.9\pm4.9$~km $\rm s^{-1}$) of the BSS may provide constraints on its age (less than a hundred million years), but more formation details require further investigation.</description>

      <title>Detached Circumstellar Matter as an Explanation for Slowly-Rising Interacting Type Ibc Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) supernovae (SNe) are known to have massive circumstellar matter (CSM) that are well detached from the star. Using the open-source code CHIPS, we construct a grid of models of SN Ibc interacting with detached CSM. We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with CSM of a density profile motivated from wind or eruptions that are continuous down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Polarized Solar Corona during the Annular Eclipse of October 14, 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 2023 October 14, using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph "CATEcor" builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a "shaded-truss" externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R$_\odot$ during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.</description>

      <title>Multiple Peaks and a Long Precursor in the Type IIn Supernova 2021qqp: An Energetic Explosion in a Complex Circumstellar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long precursor for $\approx300$ days, a rapid increase in brightness for $\approx60$ days, and then a sharp increase of $\approx1.6$ mag in only a few days to a first peak of $M_r \approx -19.5$ mag. The light curve then declines rapidly until it re-brightens to a second distinct peak of $M_r \approx -17.3$ mag centered at $\approx335$ days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with a complex morphology, including a narrow component with a width of $\approx 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 2500$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of $\approx 8500$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 5600$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction shell. Using the luminosity and velocity evolution, we construct a flexible analytical model, finding two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of $\approx 10$ and $\approx 5\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ about $0.8$ and $2$ yr before explosion, respectively, with a total CSM mass of $\approx 2-4\,M_{\odot}$. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode could explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be $\approx 5-30\,M_{\odot}$ for an explosion energy of $\approx (3-10)\times10^{51}$ erg. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels.</description>

      <title>Large-field CO (J=1-0) observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19788</link>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.</description>
