      <title>Low-field all-optical detection of superconductivity using NV nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamond offer a microwave-free, noninvasive platform for probing superconductors via near zero-field cross-relaxation magnetometry. We demonstrate this by depositing nanodiamonds on YBCO thin films to measure critical parameters: transition temperature and penetration field. This method leverages nanodiamond fluorescence modulation as a result of magnetic field variation with 1mT amplitude to observe the Meissner effect and field scans to measure the penetration field. The approach is minimally invasive and can be applied to superconducting samples with rough surfaces, facilitating the study of flux vortices and critical phenomena in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has established a new high-temperature superconductor family. The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates.</description>

      <title>Interlayer coupling enhanced superconductivity near 100 K in La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematically controlling the superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/\AA, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Switchable chiral 2x2 pair density wave in pure CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electron pairing in a super clean kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 290. By using the dilution-refrigerator-based scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility (SECUF), we find that the pairing gap exhibits chiral 2x2 modulations, and their chirality can be controlled by magnetic field training. We introduce nonmagnetic impurities to observe the complete suppression of 2x2 pairing modulations in presence of persistent 2x2 charge order. This nonmagnetic pair-breaking effect provides phase-sensitive evidence for pair-density-wave (PDW) induced pairing modulations. Our results support switchable chiral 2x2 PDW in this super clean kagome superconductor.</description>

      <title>Broad nonlocal spectrum in the Pb-InSb hybrid three terminals for potential realization of Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.</description>

      <title>$\eta$-pairing in the model with two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of a model, that takes into account two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons, the effective interaction between conduction electrons is calculated. It is shown that this interaction is attractive when the energy of the localized electron corresponding to the two-particle state lies in the conduction band above the Fermi energy. The magnitude of the attractive interaction is minimal for $\eta$-paired states of conduction electrons. We generalize the original $\eta$-pairing construction for the proposed model and show that the superconducting state can indeed be realized.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Variational Principles for Hybrid Non-Unitary Dynamics: Application to Driven-Dissipative Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce time-dependent variational principles to study the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, including dynamics described by the full Lindblad master equation, the non-Hermitian dynamics corresponding to the no-click limit of the fully post-selected quantum trajectories, and the dynamics described by a hybrid Lindbladian with a control parameter $\alpha$ which interpolates between the full post-selection and averaging over all quantum trajectories. As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states. By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality at the end of a pseudogap phase in superconducting infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Influence of Fermi Surface Geometry and Van Hove Singularities on the Optical Response of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the sensitivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to Fermi surface reconstructions under strain, we investigate how Fermi surface geometry and Van Hove singularities influence the optical Hall response and polar Kerr effect. Within a three-orbital model, we explore the impact of chemical potential and interlayer hopping on superconducting pairing and response functions. We find that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ symmetries are the leading candidates for the quasi-2D orbital, while a chiral $p$-wave state in the quasi-1D orbitals is essential for generating an accessible Kerr angle. The Lifshitz transition is shown to affect coherence factors and density-of-states peaks, producing sharp signatures in $T_c$ and optical transport. Inter-orbital charge transfer further enhances these effects by modifying the balance between quasi-1D and quasi-2D contributions. These results provide a framework for interpreting Kerr effect experiments in multi-orbital superconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity outside an Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</description>

      <title>Growth optimization of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate high-temperature superconducting thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of class D real-space topological invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.</description>
