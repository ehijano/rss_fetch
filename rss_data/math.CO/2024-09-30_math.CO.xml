      <title>The Distinguishing Index of Mycielskian Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinguishing index gives a measure of symmetry in a graph. Given a graph $G$ with no $K_2$ component, a distinguishing edge coloring is a coloring of the edges of $G$ such that no non-trivial automorphism preserves the edge coloring. The distinguishing index, denoted $\operatorname{Dist^{\prime}}(G)$, is the smallest number of colors needed for a distinguishing edge coloring. The Mycielskian of a graph $G$, denoted $\mu(G)$, is an extension of $G$ introduced by Mycielski in 1955. In 2020, Alikhani and Soltani conjectured a relationship between $operatorname{Dist^{\prime}}(G)$ and $operatorname{Dist^{\prime}}(\mu(G))$. We prove that for all graphs $G$ with at least 3 vertices, no connected $K_2$ component, and at most one isolated vertex, $\operatorname{Dist^{\prime}}(\mu(G)) \le \operatorname{Dist^{\prime}}(G)$, exceeding their conjecture. We also prove analogous results about generalized Mycielskian graphs. Together with the work in 2022 of Boutin, Cockburn, Keough, Loeb, Perry, and Rombach this completes the conjecture of Alikhani and Soltani.</description>

      <title>A Linear Lower Bound for the Square Energy of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq\lambda_n$. Let \[s^+(G)=\sum_{\lambda_i&gt;0} \lambda_i^2, \qquad s^-(G)=\sum_{\lambda_i&lt;0} \lambda_i^2.\] The smaller value, $s(G)=\min\{s^+(G), s^-(G)\}$ is called the \emph{square energy} of $G$. In 2016, Elphick, Farber, Goldberg and Wocjan conjectured that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$, $s(G)\geq n-1.$ No linear bound for $s(G)$ in terms of $n$ is known. Let $H_1, \ldots, H_k$ be disjoint vertex-induced subgraphs of $G$. In this note, we prove that \[s^+(G)\geq\sum_{i=1}^{k} s^+(H_i) \quad \text{ and } \quad s^-(G)\geq\sum_{i=1}^{k} s^-(H_i),\] which implies that $s(G)\geq \frac{3n}{4}$ for every connected graph $G$ of order $n\ge 4$.</description>

      <title>A bounded diameter strengthening of K\H{o}nig's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K\H onig's theorem says that the vertex cover number of every bipartite graph is at most its matching number (in fact they are equal since, trivially, the matching number is at most the vertex cover number). An equivalent formulation of K\H onig's theorem is that in every $2$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, the number of monochromatic components needed to cover the vertex set of $G$ is at most the independence number of $G$.
  We prove the following strengthening of K\H onig's theorem: In every $2$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, the number of monochromatic subgraphs of bounded diameter needed to cover the vertex set of $G$ is at most the independence number of $G$.</description>

      <title>The 2-rainbow domination number of Cartesian product of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-rainbow dominating function ($k$RDF) of $G$ is a function that assigns subsets of $ \{1,2,...,k\}$ to the vertices of $G$ such that for vertices $v$ with $f(v)=\emptyset $ we have $\bigcup\nolimits_{u\in N(v)}f(u)=\{1,2,...,k\}$.
  The weight $w(f)$ of a $k$RDF $f$ is defined as $w(f)=\sum_{v\in V(G)}\left\vert f(v)\right\vert $. The minimum weight of a $k$RDF of $G$ is called the $k$-rainbow domination number of $G$, which is denoted by $\gamma_{rk}(G)$. In this paper, we study the 2-rainbow domination number of the Cartesian product of two cycles. Exact values are given for a number of infinite families and we prove lower and upper bounds for all other cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems on outerplanar and planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,F)$ be the maximum spectral radius over all $n$-vertex $F$-free outerplanar graphs and planar graphs, respectively. Define $tC_l$ as $t$ vertex-disjoint $l$-cycles, $B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by sharing a common vertex among $t$ edge-disjoint $l$-cycles %$B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by connecting all cycles in $tC_l$ at a single vertex, and $(t+1)K_{2}$ as the disjoint union of $t+1$ copies of $K_2$. In the 1990s, Cvetkovi\'c and Rowlinson conjectured $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ maximizes spectral radius in outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices, while Boots and Royle (independently, Cao and Vince) conjectured $K_2 \vee P_{n-2} $ does so in planar graphs. Tait and Tobin [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2017] determined the fundamental structure as the key to confirming these two conjectures for sufficiently large $n.$ Recently, Fang et al. [J. Graph Theory, 2024] characterized the extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,tC_l)$ in planar graphs by using this key. In this paper, we first focus on outerplanar graphs and adopt a similar approach to describe the key structure of the connected extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$, where $F$ is contained in $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ but not in $K_{1} \vee ((t-1)K_2\cup(n-2t+1)K_1)$. Based on this structure, we determine $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,B_{tl})$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,(t+1)K_{2})$ along with their unique extremal graphs for all $t\geq1$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$. Moreover, we further extend the results to planar graphs, characterizing the unique extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,B_{tl})$ for all $t\geq3$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$.</description>

      <title>Bivariate exponential integrals and edge-bicolored graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that specific exponential bivariate integrals serve as generating functions of labeled edge-bicolored graphs. Based on this, we prove an asymptotic formula for the number of regular edge-bicolored graphs with arbitrary weights assigned to different vertex structures. The asymptotic behavior is governed by the critical points of a polynomial. As an application, we discuss the Ising model on a random 4-regular graph and show how its phase transitions arise from our formula.</description>

      <title>Hankel Determinants for a Class of Weighted Lattice Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our primary goal is to calculate the Hankel determinants for a class of lattice paths, which are distinguished by the step set consisting of \(\{(1,0), (2,0), (k-1,1), (-1,1)\}\), where the parameter \(k\geq 4\). These paths are constrained to return to the $x$-axis and remain above the \(x\)-axis.
  When calculating for \(k = 4\), the problem essentially reduces to determining the Hankel determinant of \(E(x)\), where \(E(x)\) is defined as \[ E(x) = \frac{a}{E(x)x^2(dx^2 - bx - 1) + cx^2 + bx + 1}. \] Our approach involves employing the Sulanke-Xin continued fraction transform to derive a set of recurrence relations, which in turn yield the desired results. For \(k \geq 5\), we utilize a class of shifted periodic continued fractions as defined by Wang-Xin-Zhai, thereby obtaining the results presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>The embedding of line graphs associated to the annihilator graph of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The annihilator graph $AG(R)$ of the commutative ring $R$ is an undirected graph with vertex set as the set of all non-zero zero divisors of $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $ann(xy) \neq ann(x) \cup ann(y)$. In this paper, we study the embedding of the line graph of $AG(R)$ into orientable or non-orientable surfaces. We completely characterize all the finite commutative rings such that the line graph of $AG(R)$ is of genus or crosscap at most two.</description>

      <title>The existence of $m$-Haar graphical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the well-studied concept of graphical regular representations to bipartite graphs, a Haar graphical representation (HGR) of a group $G$ is a bipartite graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to $G$ and acts semiregularly with the orbits giving the bipartition. The question of which groups admit an HGR was inspired by a closely related question of Est\'elyi and Pisanski in 2016, as well as Babai's work in 1980 on poset representations, and has been recently solved by Morris and Spiga. In this paper, we introduce the $m$-Haar graphical representation ($m$-HGR) as a natural generalization of HGR to $m$-partite graphs for $m\geq2$, and explore the existence of $m$-HGRs for any fixed group. This inquiry represents a more robust version of the existence problem of G$m$SRs as addressed by Du, Feng and Spiga in 2020. Our main result is a complete classification of finite groups $G$ without $m$-HGRs.</description>

      <title>On the average squared radius of gyration of a family of embeddings of subdivision graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we have an embedding of a graph $\mathbf{G}$ created by subdividing the edges of a simpler graph $\mathbf{G'}$. The edges of $\mathbf{G}$ can be divided into subsets which join pairs of ``junction'' vertices in $\mathbf{G'}$. The displacement vectors of the edges in each subset sum to the displacement between junctions. We can construct a family of embeddings of $\mathbf{G}$ with the same junction positions by rearranging the displacements in each group. In this paper, we show that the average (squared) radius of gyration of these embeddings is given by a simple formula involving a weighted (squared) radius of gyration of the positions of the junctions and the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges of $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{G'}$. This ensemble of graph embeddings arises naturally in polymer science.</description>

      <title>Tree height and the asymptotic mean of the Colijn-Plazzotta rank of unlabeled binary rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colijn--Plazzotta ranking is a bijective encoding of the unlabeled binary rooted trees with positive integers. We show that the rank $f(t)$ of a tree $t$ is closely related to its height $h$, the length of the longest path from a leaf to the root. We consider the rank $f(\tau_n)$ of a random $n$-leaf tree $\tau_n$ under each of three models: (i) uniformly random unlabeled unordered binary rooted trees, or unlabeled topologies; (ii) uniformly random leaf-labeled binary trees, or labeled topologies under the uniform model; and (iii) random binary search trees, or labeled topologies under the Yule--Harding model. Relying on the close relationship between tree rank and tree height, we obtain results concerning the asymptotic properties of $\log \log f(\tau_n)$. In particular, we find $\mathbb{E} \{\log_2 \log f(\tau_n)\} \sim 2 \sqrt{\pi n}$ for uniformly random unlabeled ordered binary rooted trees and uniformly random leaf-labeled binary trees, and for a constant $\alpha \approx 4.31107$, $\mathbb{E}\{\log_2 \log f(\tau_n)\} \sim \alpha \log n $ for leaf-labeled binary trees under the Yule--Harding model. We show that the mean of $f(\tau_n)$ itself under the three models is largely determined by the rank $c_{n-1}$ of the highest-ranked tree -- the caterpillar -- obtaining an asymptotic relationship with $\pi_n c_{n-1}$, where $\pi_n$ is a model-specific function of $n$. The results resolve open problems, providing a new class of results on an encoding useful in mathematical phylogenetics.</description>

      <title>An $11/6$-Approximation Algorithm for Vertex Cover on String Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 1.8334-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover on string graphs given with a representation, which takes polynomial time in the size of the representation; the exact approximation factor is $11/6$. Recently, the barrier of 2 was broken by Lokshtanov et al. [SoGC '24] with a 1.9999-approximation algorithm. Thus we increase by three orders of magnitude the distance of the approximation ratio to the trivial bound of 2. Our algorithm is very simple. The intricacies reside in its analysis, where we mainly establish that string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 11 are 8-colorable. Previously, Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour [JCTB '21] showed that string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 7 are 80-colorable, and string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 5 have bounded chromatic number.</description>

Abstract: Interior and exterior angle vectors of polytopes capture curvature information at faces of all dimensions and can be seen as metric variants of $f$-vectors. In this context, Gram's relation takes the place of the Euler--Poincar\'e relation as the unique linear relation among interior angles. We show the existence and uniqueness of Euler--Poincar\'e-type relations for generalized angle vectors by building a bridge to the algebraic combinatorics of geometric lattices, generalizing work of Klivans--Swartz.
  We introduce flag-angles of polytopes as a geometric counterpart to flag-$f$-vectors. Flag-angles generalize the angle deficiencies of Descartes--Shephard, Grassmann angles, and spherical intrinsic volumes. Using the machinery of incidence algebras, we relate flag-angles of zonotopes to flag-$f$-vectors of graded posets. This allows us to determine the linear relations satisfied by interior/exterior flag-angle vectors.</description>

      <title>Filling a triangulation of the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Define the tet-volume of a triangulation of the 2-sphere to be the minimum number of tetrahedra in a 3-complex of which it is the boundary, and let $d(v)$ be the maximum tet-volume for $v$-vertex triangulations. In 1986 Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston (STT) proved that $d(v) = 2v-10$ holds for large $v$, and conjectured that it holds for all $v \geq 13$. Their proof used hyperbolic polyhedra of large volume. They suggested using more general notions of volume instead. In work that was all but lost, Mathieu and Thurston used this approach to outline a combinatorial proof of the STT asymptotic result. Here we use a much simplified version of their approach to prove the full conjecture. This implies STT's weaker conjecture, proven by Pournin in 2014, characterizing the maximum rotation distance between trees.</description>

      <title>Continued fractions using a Laguerre digraph interpretation of the Foata--Zeilberger bijection and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the combinatorial theory of continued fractions, the Foata--Zeilberger bijection and its variants have been extensively used to derive various continued fractions enumerating several (sometimes infinitely many) simultaneous statistics on permutations (combinatorial model for factorials) and D-permutations (combinatorial model for Genocchi and median Genocchi numbers). A Laguerre digraph is a digraph in which each vertex has in- and out-degrees $0$ or $1$. In this paper, we interpret the Foata--Zeilberger bijection in terms of Laguerre digraphs, which enables us to count cycles in permutations. Using this interpretation, we obtain Jacobi-type continued fractions for multivariate polynomials enumerating permutations, and also Thron-type and Stieltjes-type continued fractions for multivariate polynomials enumerating D-permutations, in both cases including the counting of cycles. This enables us to prove some conjectured continued fractions due to Sokal and Zeng (2022 Advances in Applied Mathematics) in the case of permutations, and Randrianarivony and Zeng (1996 Electronic Journal of Combinatorics) and Deb and Sokal (2024 Advances in Applied Mathematics) in the case of D-permutations.</description>

      <title>On polynomial degree-boundedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Bonamy, Bousquet, Pilipczuk, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, Thomass\'e, and Walczak, that for every graph $H$, there is a polynomial $p$ such that for every positive integer $s$, every graph of average degree at least $p(s)$ contains either $K_{s,s}$ as a subgraph or contains an induced subdivision of $H$. This improves upon a result of K\"uhn and Osthus from 2004 who proved it for graphs whose average degree is at least triply exponential in $s$ and a recent result of Du, Gir\~{a}o, Hunter, McCarty and Scott for graphs with average degree at least singly exponential in $s$. As an application, we prove that the class of graphs that do not contain an induced subdivision of $K_{s,t}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. In the case of $K_{2,3}$, this is the class of theta-free graphs, and answers a question of Davies. Along the way, we also answer a recent question of McCarty, by showing that if $\mathcal{G}$ is a hereditary class of graphs for which there is a polynomial $p$ such that every bipartite $K_{s,s}$-free graph in $\mathcal{G}$ has average degree at most $p(s)$, then more generally, there is a polynomial $p'$ such that every $K_{s,s}$-free graph in $\mathcal{G}$ has average degree at most $p'(s)$. Our main new tool is an induced variant of the K\H{o}v\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem, which we find to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Sandpile Torsor Algorithm for Regular Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every regular matroid is associated with a sandpile group, which acts simply transitively on the set of bases in various ways. Ganguly and the second author introduced the notion of consistency to describe classes of actions that respect deletion-contraction in a precise sense, and proved the consistency of rotor-routing torsors (and uniqueness thereof) for plane graphs.
  In this work, we prove that the class of actions introduced by Backman, Baker, and the fourth author, is consistent for regular matroids. More precisely, we prove the consistency of its generalization given by Backman, Santos and the fourth author, and independently by the first author. This extends the above existence assertion, as well as makes progress on the goal of classifying all consistent actions.</description>

Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, the complement and the line graph of $G$ are denoted by $G^c$ and $L(G)$, respectively. In this paper, we show that for every simple connected regular graph $G$ with at least $5$ vertices, the graph $\mathcal{R}(G):=L(L(G)^c)^c$ is a Ramanujan graph with diameter at most three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic infinitesimal distributions of Gaussian Unitary Ensembles with permuted entries. We show that for random uniform permutations, the asymptotically permuted GUE matrix has a null infinitesimal distribution. Moreover, we show that asymptotically different permutations of the same GUE matrix are infinitesimally free. Besides this we study particular example of entry permutation - the transpose, and we show that while a GUE matrix is asymptotically free from its transpose it is not infinitesimally free from it.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics to detect partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). To lay the groundwork for our main results, we first assert that the foundation of a partisan gerrymander is to draw a map so that the preferred party wins an extreme number of seats, and that both the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias have been used to detect partisan gerrymandering.
  We then provide both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V,S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of vote-share, seat share pairs (V,S) for which there is constructed election data with vote share V , seat share S, and MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to be different.
  By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we give examples of how these two metrics are unable to detect when a map has an extreme number of districts won. Because these examples are constructed, we follow this with our empirical study, in which we show on 18 different U.S. maps that these two metrics are unable to detect when a map has an extreme number of districts won.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the following result and its discrete equivalent: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. Additionally, we show that the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>
