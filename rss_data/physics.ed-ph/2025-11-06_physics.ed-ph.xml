      <title>Introducing Quantum Computing into Statistical Physics: Random Walks and the Ising Model with Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a powerful new perspective on probabilistic and collective behaviors traditionally taught in statistical physics. This paper presents two classroom-ready modules that integrate quantum computing into the undergraduate curriculum using Qiskit: the quantum random walk and the Ising model. Both modules allow students to simulate and contrast classical and quantum systems, deepening their understanding of concepts such as superposition, interference, and statistical distributions. We outline the quantum circuits involved, provide sample code and student activities, and discuss how each example can be used to enhance student engagement with statistical physics. These modules are suitable for integration into courses in statistical mechanics, modern physics, or as part of an introductory unit on quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Faculty Online Learning Community Interactions Using Social Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) was founded in the mid-2010s to assist educators with the challenges of integrating computation into physics curricula. In addition to in-person trainings and hosted educational materials, PICUP uses a Slack Workspace to continue collaboration and discussion offline. In this work, we use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to study the communication patterns of PICUP and assess if PICUP is meeting their goals in the Slack environment. Through our analysis, we discuss PICUP's community structure and define a conceptual framework to evaluate if the goals are being met through SNA metrics. We present a comprehensive analysis of eight channels in the Slack Workspace using various SNA metrics, identifying three distinct levels of user engagement. We conclude with implications for PICUP and provide recommendations for the community.</description>

      <title>Code in Motion: Integrating Computational Thinking with Kinematics Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although physics has become increasingly computational, with computing even being considered the third pillar of physics, it is still not well integrated into physics education. Research suggests that integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into physics enhances conceptual understanding and strengthens students' ability to model and analyze phenomena. Building on this, we designed a didactic sequence for K9 students to foster specific CT practices while reinforcing fundamental kinematics concepts. The activity revealed students' ability to apply CT skills and is well suited for use in introductory kinematics courses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Kinematics Understanding through a Video Game Based on Real-Time Motion Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting kinematic graphs remains a significant challenge in physics education. The MissionMotion Project addresses this issue by providing a gamified physical-computational environment combining low-cost sensors, physical activity, computational thinking, and real-time visualization of motion graphs. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of the project, with a particular focus on the pilot phase conducted with high school students in Uruguay. During this phase, we primarily used the MEEGA+ questionnaire to evaluate the gaming experience, usability, and motivation of the participants. Our analysis of the results shows high levels of satisfaction, perceived learning, and engagement, supporting the proposal's viability. Finally, we plan to conduct a large-scale conceptual evaluation to analyze how the proposal impacts understanding of kinematic graphs using standardized assessment tools.</description>
