      <title>Some Patterns of Duplications in the outputs of Mersenne Twister Pseudorandom Number Generator MT19937</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mersenne Twister MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, introduced by the last two authors in 1998, is still widely used. It passes all existing statistical tests, except for the linear complexity test, which measures the ratio of the even-odd of the number of 1's among specific bits (and hence should not be important for most applications). Harase reported that MT19937 is rejected by some birthday-spacing tests, which are rather artificially designed. In this paper, we report that MT19937 fails in a natural test based on the distribution of run-lengths on which we found an identical value in the output 32-bit integers. The number of observations of the run-length 623 is some 40 times larger than the expectation (and than the numbers of the observations of 622 and 624, etc.), which implies that the corresponding p-value is almost 0.
  We mathematically analyze the phenomena, and obtain a theorem which explains these failures. It seems not to be a serious defect of MT19937, because finding the defect requires astronomical efforts. Still, the phenomena should be reported to the academic society relating to pseudorandom number generation.</description>

      <title>OGRe: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present OGRe, a modern Mathematica package for tensor calculus, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. The package can be used in a variety of contexts where tensor calculations are needed, in both mathematics and physics, but it is especially suitable for general relativity. By implementing an object-oriented design paradigm, OGRe allows calculating arbitrarily complicated tensor formulas easily, and automatically transforms between index configurations and coordinate systems behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user errors by making it impossible for the user to combine tensors in inconsistent ways. Other features include displaying tensors in various forms, automatic calculation of curvature tensors and geodesic equations, easy importing and exporting of tensors between sessions, optimized algorithms and parallelization for improved performance, and more.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>
