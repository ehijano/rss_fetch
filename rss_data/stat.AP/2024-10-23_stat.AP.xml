      <title>Markov switching zero-inflated space-time multinomial models for comparing multiple infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite multivariate spatio-temporal counts often containing many zeroes, zero-inflated multinomial models for space-time data have not been considered. We are interested in comparing the transmission dynamics of several co-circulating infectious diseases across space and time where some can be absent for long periods. We first assume there is a baseline disease that is well-established and always present in the region. The other diseases switch between periods of presence and absence in each area through a series of coupled Markov chains, which account for long periods of disease absence, disease interactions and disease spread from neighboring areas. Since we are mainly interested in comparing the diseases, we assume the cases of the present diseases in an area jointly follow an autoregressive multinomial model. We use the multinomial model to investigate whether there are associations between certain factors, such as temperature, and differences in the transmission intensity of the diseases. Inference is performed using efficient Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on jointly sampling all presence indicators. We apply the model to spatio-temporal counts of dengue, Zika and chikungunya cases in Rio de Janeiro, during the first triple epidemic.</description>

      <title>HDNRA: An R package for HDLSS location testing with normal-reference approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of location testing for high-dimensional data in statistical inference is notable. Existing literature suggests various methods, many of which impose strong regularity conditions on underlying covariance matrices to ensure asymptotic normal distribution of test statistics, leading to difficulties in size control. To address this, a recent set of tests employing the normal-reference approach has been proposed. Moreover, the availability of tests for high-dimensional location testing in R packages implemented in C++ is limited. This paper introduces the latest methods utilizing normal-reference approaches to test the equality of mean vectors in high-dimensional samples with potentially different covariance matrices. We present an R package named HDNRA to illustrate the implementation of these tests, extending beyond the two-sample problem to encompass general linear hypothesis testing (GLHT). The package offers easy and user-friendly access to these tests, with its core implemented in C++ using Rcpp, OpenMP and RcppArmadillo for efficient execution. Theoretical properties of these normal-reference tests are revisited, and examples based on real datasets using different tests are provided.</description>

      <title>Functional Clustering of Discount Functions for Behavioral Investor Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical finance models are based on the premise that investors act rationally and utilize all available information when making portfolio decisions. However, these models often fail to capture the anomalies observed in intertemporal choices and decision-making under uncertainty, particularly when accounting for individual differences in preferences and consumption patterns. Such limitations hinder traditional finance theory's ability to address key questions like: How do personal preferences shape investment choices? What drives investor behaviour? And how do individuals select their portfolios? One prominent contribution is Pompian's model of four Behavioral Investor Types (BITs), which links behavioural finance studies with Keirsey's temperament theory, highlighting the role of personality in financial decision-making. Yet, traditional parametric models struggle to capture how these distinct temperaments influence intertemporal decisions, such as how individuals evaluate trade-offs between present and future outcomes. To address this gap, the present study employs Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to specifically investigate temporal discounting behaviours revealing nuanced patterns in how different temperaments perceive and manage uncertainty over time. Our findings show heterogeneity within each temperament, suggesting that investor profiles are far more diverse than previously thought. This refined classification provides deeper insights into the role of temperament in shaping intertemporal financial decisions, offering practical implications for financial advisors to better tailor strategies to individual risk preferences and decision-making styles.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Modeling Approaches for Capturing Seasonal Transmission in Stochastic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seasonal variations in the incidence of infectious diseases are a well-established phenomenon, driven by factors such as climate changes, social behaviors, and ecological interactions that influence host susceptibility and transmission rates. While seasonality plays a significant role in shaping epidemiological dynamics, it is often overlooked in both empirical and theoretical studies. Incorporating seasonal parameters into mathematical models of infectious diseases is crucial for accurately capturing disease dynamics, enhancing the predictive power of these models, and developing successful control strategies. This paper highlights key modeling approaches for incorporating seasonality into disease transmission, including sinusoidal functions, periodic piecewise linear functions, Fourier series expansions, Gaussian functions, and data-driven methods, accompanied by real-world examples. Additionally, a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with seasonal transmission is demonstrated through numerical simulations. Important outcome measures, such as the basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers and the probability of a disease outbreak using branching process approximation of the Markov chain, are also presented to illustrate the impact of seasonality on disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>A class of modular and flexible covariate-based covariance functions for nonstationary spatial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumptions of stationarity and isotropy often stated over spatial processes have not aged well during the last two decades, partly explained by the combination of computational developments and the increasing availability of high-resolution spatial data. While a plethora of approaches have been developed to relax these assumptions, it is often a costly tradeoff between flexibility and a diversity of computational challenges. In this paper, we present a class of covariance functions that relies on fixed, observable spatial information that provides a convenient tradeoff while offering an extra layer of numerical and visual representation of the flexible spatial dependencies. This model allows for separate parametric structures for different sources of nonstationarity, such as marginal standard deviation, geometric anisotropy, and smoothness. It simplifies to a Mat\'ern covariance function in its basic form and is adaptable for large datasets, enhancing flexibility and computational efficiency. We analyze the capabilities of the presented model through simulation studies and an application to Swiss precipitation data.</description>

      <title>Second-order characteristics for spatial point processes with graph-valued marks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The immense progress in data collection and storage capacities have yielded rather complex, challenging spatial event-type data, where each event location is augmented by a non-simple mark. Despite the growing interest in analysing such complex event patterns, the methodology for such analysis is not embedded well in the literature. In particular, the literature lacks statistical methods to analyse marks which are characterised by an inherent relational structure, i.e.\ where the mark is graph-valued. Motivated by epidermal nerve fibre data, we introduce different mark summary characteristics, which investigate the average variation or association between pairs of graph-valued marks, and apply some of the methods to the nerve data.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale two-sample testing for network data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks arise naturally in many scientific fields as a representation of pairwise connections. Statistical network analysis has most often considered a single large network, but it is common in a number of applications, for example, neuroimaging, to observe multiple networks on a shared node set. When these networks are grouped by case-control status or another categorical covariate, the classical statistical question of two-sample comparison arises. In this work, we address the problem of testing for statistically significant differences in a given arbitrary subset of connections. This general framework allows an analyst to focus on a single node, a specific region of interest, or compare whole networks. Our ability to conduct "mesoscale" testing on a meaningful group of edges is particularly relevant for applications such as neuroimaging and distinguishes our approach from prior work, which tends to focus either on a single node or the whole network. In this mesoscale setting, we develop statistically sound projection-based tests for two-sample comparison in both weighted and binary edge networks. Our approach can leverage all available network information, and learn informative projections which improve testing power when low-dimensional latent network structure is present.</description>

Abstract: We provide a framework for efficiently estimating impulse response functions with Local Projections (LPs). Our approach offers a Bayesian treatment for LPs with Instrumental Variables, accommodating multiple shocks and instruments per shock, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses, and uses all available data across horizons by imputing missing values.</description>

      <title>Dhoroni: Exploring Bengali Climate Change and Environmental Views with a Multi-Perspective News Dataset and Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses critical challenges globally, disproportionately affecting low-income countries that often lack resources and linguistic representation on the international stage. Despite Bangladesh's status as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate impacts, research gaps persist in Bengali-language studies related to climate change and NLP. To address this disparity, we introduce Dhoroni, a novel Bengali (Bangla) climate change and environmental news dataset, comprising a 2300 annotated Bangla news articles, offering multiple perspectives such as political influence, scientific/statistical data, authenticity, stance detection, and stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we present an in-depth exploratory analysis of Dhoroni and introduce BanglaBERT-Dhoroni family, a novel baseline model family for climate and environmental opinion detection in Bangla, fine-tuned on our dataset. This research contributes significantly to enhancing accessibility and analysis of climate discourse in Bengali (Bangla), addressing crucial communication and research gaps in climate-impacted regions like Bangladesh with 180 million people.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm of mortality modeling via individual vitality dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significance of mortality modeling extends across multiple research areas, ranging from life insurance valuation to optimal lifetime decision-making. Existing approaches, such as mortality laws and factor-based models, often fall short in capturing the complexity of individual mortality, hindering their ability to address specific research needs. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to mortality modeling centered on the dynamics of individual vitality. A four-component framework is developed to account for initial conditions, natural aging processes, stochastic fluctuations, and accidental events over an individual's lifetime. We demonstrate the framework's analytical capabilities across various settings and explore its practical implications in solving life insurance problems and deriving optimal lifetime decisions. Our results show that the proposed framework not only encompasses existing mortality models but also provides individualized mortality outcomes and offers an intuitive explanation for survival biases.</description>

      <title>Predicting Value at Risk for Cryptocurrencies With Generalized Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the prediction of Value at Risk (VaR) for cryptocurrencies. In contrast to classic assets, returns of cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile and characterized by large fluctuations around single events. Analyzing a comprehensive set of 105 major cryptocurrencies, we show that Generalized Random Forests (GRF) (Athey, Tibshirani &amp; Wager, 2019) adapted to quantile prediction have superior performance over other established methods such as quantile regression, GARCH-type and CAViaR models. This advantage is especially pronounced in unstable times and for classes of highly-volatile cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we identify important predictors during such times and show their influence on forecasting over time. Moreover, a comprehensive simulation study also indicates that the GRF methodology is at least on par with existing methods in VaR predictions for standard types of financial returns and clearly superior in the cryptocurrency setup.</description>

      <title>On metric choice in dimension reduction for Fr\'echet regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet regression is becoming a mainstay in modern data analysis for analyzing non-traditional data types belonging to general metric spaces. This novel regression method is especially useful in the analysis of complex health data such as continuous monitoring and imaging data. Fr\'echet regression utilizes the pairwise distances between the random objects, which makes the choice of metric crucial in the estimation. In this paper, existing dimension reduction methods for Fr\'echet regression are reviewed, and the effect of metric choice on the estimation of the dimension reduction subspace is explored for the regression between random responses and Euclidean predictors. Extensive numerical studies illustrate how different metrics affect the central and central mean space estimators. Two real applications involving analysis of brain connectivity networks of subjects with and without Parkinson's disease and an analysis of the distributions of glycaemia based on continuous glucose monitoring data are provided, to demonstrate how metric choice can influence findings in real applications.</description>
