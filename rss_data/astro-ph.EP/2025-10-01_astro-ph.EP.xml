      <title>Testing the performance of cross-correlation techniques to search for molecular features in JWST NIRSpec G395H observations of transiting exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-correlations techniques offer an alternative method to search for molecular species in JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. In a previous article, we applied cross-correlation functions for the first time to JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of exoplanet atmospheres, resulting in a detection of CO in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b and a tentative detection of CO isotopologues. Here we present an improved version of our cross-correlation technique and an investigation into how efficient the technique is when searching for other molecules in JWST NIRSpec/G395H data. Our search results in the detection of more molecules via cross-correlations in the atmosphere of WASP-39b, including $\rm H_{2}O$ and $\rm CO_{2}$, and confirms the CO detection. This result proves that cross-correlations are a robust and computationally cheap alternative method to search for molecular species in transmission spectra observed with JWST. We also searched for other molecules ($\rm CH_{4}$, $\rm NH_{3}$, $\rm SO_{2}$, $\rm N_{2}O$, $\rm H_{2}S$, $\rm PH_{3}$, $\rm O_{3}$ and $\rm C_{2}H_{2}$) that were not detected, for which we provide the definition of their cross-correlation baselines for future searches of those molecules in other targets. We find that that the cross-correlation search of each molecule is more efficient over limited wavelength regions of the spectrum, where the signal for that molecule dominates over other molecules, than over broad wavelength ranges. In general we also find that Gaussian normalization is the most efficient normalization mode for the generation of the molecular templates.</description>

      <title>Combined Exoplanet Mass and Atmospheric Characterization for Accelerated Exoplanetology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's most detailed characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is accessible via transit spectroscopy (TS). Detecting transiting exoplanets only yields their size, and it is thus standard to measure a planet's mass before moving towards their atmospheric characterization, or even the publication of their discovery. This framework, however, can act as a bottleneck for high-throughput exoplanetology. Here, we review existing applications of an alternative approach deriving exoplanet masses in small JWST atmospheric exploration programs and quantify the potential of its systematic application. We find that for $\sim$20\% of transiting exoplanets with existing mass constraints, a small JWST exploration program could yield the planetary mass with a similar -- or better -- precision. Such results suggest that proceeding directly with atmospheric exploration programs for favorable exoplanets (i.e., with a transmission spectroscopy metric, TSM, $\geq$100) could substantially reduce the time from detection to exoplanet atmospheric study and further support JWST's scientific output over its lifetime while saving up to 20\% of resources on radial-velocity (RV) facilities. Furthermore, it can substantially increase the sample of characterized planets of three distinct subpopulations (Neptune-sized, young, and hot-star exoplanets), each providing specific insights into formation and evolution processes. As the field of exoplanets increasingly turns to directly imaged planets, mastering the determination of planetary masses from atmospheric spectra will become essential.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries II: A Dichotomy in Orbital Alignment of Small Planets in Close Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\prime\prime}$ to $2^{\prime\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p&lt;5R_{\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\log Z\gtrsim13.9$, or $\approx$5$\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\sigma_1 = 2^{\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\sigma_2 = 23^{\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $&gt;40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $&lt;40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal atmospheric characterization of $\beta$ Pictoris b: Adding high-resolution continuum spectra from GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first VLTI/GRAVITY observations at R$_\lambda \sim 4000$ of $\beta$ Pic b. These four high S/N ($\sim$20) K-band spectra conserve both the pseudo-continuum and molecular absorption patterns. We analyze them with four self-consistent forward model grids (Exo-REM, ATMO, BT-Settl, Sonora) exploring $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, log(g), metallicity, C/O, and $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio. We also upgrade our forward modeling code \texttt{\textit{ForMoSA}} to account for the data multi-modality and combine the GRAVITY epochs with published 1-5 $\mu$m photometry, low- to medium-resolution spectra (0.9-7 $\mu$m), and high-resolution echelle spectra (2.1-5.2 $\mu$m). Sonora and Exo-REM are statistically preferred. Exo-REM yields $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1607.45^{+4.85}_{-6.20}$ K and log(g) $=4.46^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ dex from GRAVITY alone, and $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1502.74^{+2.32}_{-2.14}$ K and log(g) $=4.00\pm0.01$ dex when including all datasets. Archival data significantly affect the retrieved parameters. C/O remains solar ($0.552^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$) while [M/H] reaches super-solar values (0.50$\pm$0.01). We report the first tentative constraint on log($^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO) $\sim$1.12, though this remains inconclusive due to telluric residuals. Additionally, we estimate the luminosity to be log(L/L$_\odot$) $=-4.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, implying a heavy-element content of up to $\sim$5% (20-80 M$_\oplus$) given the system age and dynamical mass measurements. Access to both continuum and molecular lines at K-band significantly impacts the metallicity, possibly owing to collision-induced absorption shaping the continuum. Echelle spectra do not dominate the final fit with respect to lower resolution data. Future multi-modal frameworks should include weighting schemes reflecting bandwidth and central wavelength coverage.</description>

      <title>Multi-year stacking searches for solar system bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital tracking detects faint solar system bodies by stacking many images along hypothesized orbits, revealing objects that are undetectable in every individual exposure. Previous searches have been restricted to small areas and short time baselines. We present a general framework to quantify both sensitivity and computational requirements for digital tracking of nonlinear motion across the full sky over multi-year baselines. We start from matched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades with trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter space. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is isotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial orbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that stack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits. We quantify ZTF's sensitivity to populations beyond 5 au and show that stacking reaches most of the remaining Planet 9 parameter space. The computational demands of all-sky, multi-year tracking are extreme, but we demonstrate that time segmentation and image blurring greatly reduce orbit density at modest sensitivity cost. Stacking effectively boosts medium-aperture surveys to the Rubin Observatory single-exposure depth across the northern sky. Digital tracking in dense Rubin observations of a 10 sq. deg field is tractable and could detect trans-Neptunian objects to 27th magnitude in a single night, with deep drilling fields reaching fainter still.</description>

      <title>The Open-Source Photochem Code: A General Chemical and Climate Model for Interpreting (Exo)Planet Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, we are firmly in the era of exoplanet atmosphere characterization. Understanding exoplanet spectra requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics, thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100 time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Water Distribution in Jupiter's Mid Latitudes: Influence of Precipitation and Planetary Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter's bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter's atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential non-uniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter's mid-latitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A non-uniform water vapor distribution emerges in the mid-latitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from sub-solar to super-solar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter's mid-latitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a super-solar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the non-uniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Model Predictions for the 2025 October Draconid Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The October Draconid meteor shower, produced by comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, is notorious for rare but intense outbursts, some exceeding rates of about 10 000 meteors per hour. In 2025, Earth will encounter young trails ejected by the comet in 2005 and 2012, producing a meteor outburst and providing a rare opportunity to probe their structure and benchmark meteoroid stream models. We present predictions from three independent dynamical models (NIMS, MSFC, Sisyphus), calibrated against updated activity profiles including the newly observed 2019 and 2024 outbursts. All simulations predict enhanced activity on 2025 October 8, dominated by faint meteors (m &lt; 0.01 g; +4 mag and fainter) primarily detectable by radar. Our best estimate is a radar outburst near 15:00 - 16:00 UT, driven mainly by the 2012 trail with a possible minor contribution from 2005. The 2025 Draconids may represent one of the strongest radar dominated outbursts of the decade. Coordinated observing campaigns, especially radar measurements across the Northern Hemisphere and optical coverage from Asia, will be essential to validate these forecasts, constrain the dust environment of comet 21P, and improve future predictions of young meteoroid trails.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Atmosphere of HD 149026b: The Role of Stellar Abundances and Choice of Opacities in Exoplanet Atmosphere Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs within the same molecular cloud as the host star, suggesting a link between the elemental abundances of star and the planet. Exoplanet atmosphere studies often assume solar abundances for host stars, however, specific host star abundances might lead to more accurate constraints. In this work, we perform sensitivity studies for a metal rich stellar host HD 149026 and its exoplanet HD 149026b, to understand the effect of solar versus stellar abundance choice on the $P$-$T$ profiles, equilibrium chemical abundances and emission spectra, using self-consistent atmosphere models. We find that the differences are dependent on the model parameters, particularly C/O ratio, and for HD 149026b the difference in the eclipse depth is maximum $\sim$80 ppm, for C/O between 0.75-0.85. Recent JWST NIRCam observations of HD 149026b have yielded widely varying metallicity ranges, highly super-solar (59-275$\times$) using chemical equilibrium retrievals and 12-31$\times$ solar using self-consistent models, both using solar abundances. In this work, we constrain the metallicity of HD 149026b to be 53-113$\times$ solar, with solar abundances and 39-78$\times$ stellar, with stellar abundances. We constrain the self-consistent $P$-$T$ profile of HD 149026b to be substantially cooler (upto 500 K) than the self-consistent best-fit model in the previous work, in the emission spectra probed region, thus requiring higher CO$_2$ abundance to explain the observations, leading to comparatively higher metallicity constraint. We find that the inclusion of Fe opacity in computing self-consistent $P$-$T$ profiles for HD 149026b in our models is the major reason for these differences. We constrain the C/O ratio to 0.47-0.68 and the heat redistribution factor to 0.70-0.76, indicating higher heat redistribution than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>Second-timescale Glints from Satellites and Space Debris Detected with Tomo-e Gozen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for second-timescale optical transients is one of the frontiers of time-domain astronomy. However, it has been pointed out that reflections of sunlight from Earth-orbiting objects can also produce second-timescale ``glints.'' We conducted wide-field observations at 2 frames per second using Tomo-e Gozen on the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope. We identified 1554 point-source glints that appeared in only one frame (0.5 sec). Their brightness ranges from 11 to 16 mag, with fainter glints being more numerous. These glints are likely caused by satellites and space debris in high-altitude orbits such as the geosynchronous Earth orbit or highly elliptical orbits. Many glints brighter than 14 mag are associated with known satellites or debris with large apogees ($&gt;$ 30,000 km). In contrast, most fainter glints are not associated with cataloged objects and may be due to debris with sizes of 0.3--1 m. The event rate of second-timescale glints is estimated to be $4.7 \pm 0.2\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (average) and $9.0 \pm 0.3\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (near the equator) at 15.5 mag. Our results demonstrate that high-altitude debris can represent a significant foreground in searches for second-timescale optical transients. They also imply that deep surveys such as Rubin/LSST will detect many of these glints in single-exposure images.</description>

      <title>Edge-On Disk Study (EODS) III: Molecular Stratification in the Flying Saucer Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Investigating the vertical distribution of molecular content in protoplanetary disks remains difficult in most disks mildly inclined along the line of sight. In contrast, edge-on disks provide a direct (tomographic) view of the 2D molecular brightness. Aims: We study the radial and vertical molecular distribution as well as the gas temperature and density by observing the Keplerian edge-on disk surrounding the Flying Saucer, a Class II object located in Ophiuchus. Methods: We use new and archival ALMA data to perform a tomography of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, CN, HCN, CS, H$_2$CO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, N$_2$D$^+$, DCN and $^{13}$CS. We analyze molecular tomographies and model data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit. Results: We directly measure the altitude above the mid-plane for each observed species. For the first time, we unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a common molecular layer and measure its thickness: most molecules are located at the same altitude versus radius. Beyond CO, as predicted by chemical models, the CN emission traces the upper boundary of the molecular layer, whereas the deuterated species (DCN and N2D+) resides below one scale-height. Our best fits from DiskFit show that most observed transitions in the molecular layer are thermalized because their excitation temperature is the same, around 17-20 K. Conclusions: These long-integration observations clearly reveal a molecular layer predominantly located around 1-2 scale height, at a temperature above the CO freeze-out temperature. The deuterated molecules are closer to the mid-plane and N2D+ may be a good proxy for the CO snowline. Some molecules, such as CN and H2CO, are likely influenced by the disk environment, at least beyond the mm dust disk radius. The direct observation of the molecular stratification opens the door to detailed chemical modeling in this disk which appears representative of T Tauri disks.</description>

      <title>Extreme NiI/FeI abundance ratio in the coma of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of solar system comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in solar system comets. On average, this ratio is one order of magnitude higher than the solar Ni/Fe abundance ratio. Here, we report observations of the new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph. Spectra were obtained at six epochs, at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a fluorescence model. Comet 3I exhibits a high production rate of NiI atoms as well as a high NiI/FeI ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar system comets and 2I/Borisov. Additionally, we found that the NiI/FeI ratio decreases rapidly with decreasing heliocentric distance, suggesting that comet 3I could soon become indistinguishable from solar system comets in this respect. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls, which supports the presence of these species in the cometary material.</description>

      <title>Architecture of planetary systems with and without outer giant planets I. Inner planet detections around HD 23079, HD 196067, and HD 86226</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the link between outer giant planets (OGPs) and inner light planets (ILPs) is key to understanding planetary system formation and architecture. The correlation between these two populations of planets is debated both theoretically -- different formation models predict either a correlation or an anticorrelation -- and observationally. Several recent attempts to constrain this correlation have yielded contradictory results, due to small-number statistics and heterogeneous samples. We present an ongoing long-term observational effort with CORALIE, HARPS, and ESPRESSO to probe the ILP occurrence in systems with and without OGP. In this first article of a series, we discuss how, from the design to the observations, we ensured the homogeneity of the samples, both in terms of stellar properties and observing strategy. We also present the first three detections of ILPs in our OGP host sample. We find a 8.3 mE planet at 5.75 d around HD 23079, a 10.4 mE planet at 4.6 d around HD 196067, and we confirm the 7.5 mE planet at 3.98 d around HD 86226. While a rigorous statistical analysis of our samples will be performed in subsequent studies, the relatively low number of detections in our sample seems to contradict previous studies that found a strong OGP-ILP correlation.</description>

      <title>General Relativity Can Prevent a Runaway Greenhouse on Potentially Habitable Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets orbiting in the habitable zones of white dwarfs have recently been proposed as promising targets for biosignature searches. However, since the white dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are subject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work (Barnes &amp; Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ($e \sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>A transiting hot Jupiter with two outer siblings orbiting an intermediate-mass post main-sequence star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary systems with multiple giant planets present an opportunity to understand planet formation, migration processes, and long-term system-wide dynamical interactions. In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish between smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system evolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique multi-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main sequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected by the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations conducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained with FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two additional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375 b is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \pm 0.00002$ days, mass $0.745 \pm 0.053,M_\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \pm 0.043, R_\mathrm{J}$, and eccentricity $0.087 \pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d, are warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ days and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \pm 0.22, M_\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \pm 0.28, M_\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of formation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b are consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current configuration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and high-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first known system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one transiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and migration theories.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Extinction in a Planet-Hosting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent disk observations have revealed multiple indirect signatures of forming gas giant planets, but high-contrast imaging has rarely confirmed the presence of the suspected perturbers. Here, we exploit a unique opportunity provided by the background star AS209bkg, which shines through a wide annular gap in the AS209 disk, to perform transmission spectrophotometry and directly measure the extinction from gap material for the first time. By combining new VLT/SPHERE and JWST/NIRCam observations with archival HST data from 2005, we model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AS209bkg over a 19-year baseline. We find that the SED and its variability are best explained by increasing extinction along the line of sight as AS209bkg approaches the gap edge in projection. The extinction is best described by a combination of ISM-like extinction component and a grey extinction component. This points to the presence of grains in the disk outer gap that are larger than in the ISM. We find that the extinction in the gap at $\lambda\sim4.0~\mu$m is $A_{4\,\mu\mathrm{m}} = 2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ mag, while at H$\alpha$ ($\lambda=0.656~\mu$m), where most searches for accretion signatures take place, the extinction could be as high as $A_\mathrm{H\alpha} = 4.2^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$ mag ($A_V=4.6^{+1.0}_{-1.3}$ mag). This suggests that even wide, deep gaps can significantly obscure emission from protoplanets, even those following a hot-start evolutionary model. Our extinction measurements help reconcile the discrepancy between ALMA-based predictions of planet-disk interactions and the non-detections from sensitive optical and near-infrared imaging campaigns.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Cold Worlds: Predicted Near- to Mid-infrared Spectral Signatures of a Cold Brown Dwarf with Potential Auroral Heating</title>

Abstract: Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed strong methane emission at 3.326 microns in the $\approx$482 K brown dwarf CWISEP J193518.59$-$154620.3 (W1935). Atmospheric modeling suggests the presence of a $\approx$300 K thermal inversion in its upper atmosphere, potentially driven by auroral activity. We present an extension of the retrieved spectra of W1935 with and without inversion spanning 1--20 microns, to identify thermal inversion-sensitive spectral features and explore the origin of the object's peculiar characteristics. Our analysis indicates that atmospheric heating contributes approximately 15% to the bolometric luminosity. The model with inversion predicts an additional similar-strength methane emission feature at 7.7 microns and tentative ammonia emission features in the mid-infrared. Wavelengths beyond $\sim$2 microns are significantly influenced by the inversion, except for the 4.1--5.0 microns CO$_2$ and CO features that originate from atmospheric layers deeper than the region where the inversion occurs. W1935 appears as an outlier in Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on the $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ (IRAC 3.6 microns $-$ 4.5 microns) color, but exhibits average behavior in all other combinations that trace clear sequences. This anomaly is likely due to the Ch2 filter probing vertical mixing-sensitive CO$_2$ and CO features that do not correlate with temperature or spectral type. We find that the thermal inversion tends to produce bluer $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ colors, so the overluminous and/or redder position of W1935 in diagrams involving this color cannot be explained by the thermal inversion. This analysis provides insights into the intriguing dispersion of cold brown dwarfs in mid-infrared CMDs and sheds light on their spectral diversity.</description>

Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system's dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets.
  For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter's parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which demonstrates advantages over the Individual Fit and avoids the computational cost of N-body integrations required by the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly incorporates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying log-likelihood ratios and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets, whereas the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to simulate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>

Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well-ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised `dead' outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base-level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, extending across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This, in turn, triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of the large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure that can drive accretion in the inner dead zone via a weak magnetic-pressure wind. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.</description>

Abstract: PDS 70c is a source of Ha emission and variable sub-mm signal. Understanding its emission mechanisms may enable observations of accretion rates and physical conditions in the circum-planetary environment. We report ALMA observations of PDS 70 at 145 GHz (Band 4), 343.5 GHz (Band 7) and 671 GHz (Band 9) and compare with data at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), taken within two months. The radio spectrum (SED) is analyzed with an analytical circumplanetary disk (CPD) model. In a novel approach including the free-free continuum from H I, metals (e.g. K I) and H-. New detections in Bands 3 (tentative at 2.6sigma), 4 (5sigma), and 7 (re-detected at 9sigma) are consistent with optically thick thermal emission from PDS 70c (spectral index 2+-0.2). However, a Band 9 non-detection lies 2.6sigma below an optically thick extrapolation. A viscous dusty disk is inconsistent with the data, even with the inclusion of ionised jets. Interestingly, the central temperatures in such CPD models are high enough to ionise H I, with huge emission measures and an optically thick spectrum that marginally accounts for the SED (within 3sigma of Band 9). By contrast, uniform-slab models suggest much lower emission measures to account for the Band 9 drop, with ionisation fractions ~1e-7, and an outer radius ~0.1 au. Such conditions are recovered if the CPD interacts with a planetary magnetic field, leading to a radially variable viscosity alpha(R)&lt;~1 and midplane temperatures ~1e3 K that regulate metal ionisation. However, the H- opacity still results in an optically thick SED, overshooting Band 9. We find that the optically thin turnover at ~600 GHz is only recovered if a thin shocked layer is present at the CPD surface, as suggested by simulations. A photospheric shock or accretion funnels are ruled out as radio emission sources because their small solid angles would require T~1e6 K, which is unrealistic for planetary accretion.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the Very Large Telescope/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</description>

      <title>Do Outer Giants Inflate Neptune-sized Planets? An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12328</link>

Abstract: Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \pm 4 \%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include prolonged inner-disc gas supply that boosted envelope accretion, and volatile enrichment by the outer giant. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Colors of Life in the Clouds: Biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms as a new signature to detect life on planets like Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25173</link>

Abstract: When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan &amp; E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.</description>

      <title>Debris disks and their properties with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</description>
