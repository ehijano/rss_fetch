      <title>Dissipative Generation of Currents by Nonreciprocal Local and Global Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</description>

      <title>Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity in Fermi systems within the framework of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is based on lectures given by the author at the Enrico Fermi Summer School in Varenna. It presents the basics of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for Fermi superfluids, with particular emphasis on nuclear systems. Special attention is given to the foundations of both DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). The review explores the advantages and challenges involved in the practical application of TDDFT to superfluid systems, as well as the typical approximations employed. Various applications of the TDDFT framework to the description of phenomena related to nonequilibrium superfluidity in atomic nuclei, neutron stars, and ultracold atoms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar bosons under rotation and acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G&lt;0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.</description>

      <title>Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</description>

      <title>The non-stabilizerness of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Identification and optimal control strategies for the transversal splitting of ultra--cold Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</description>
