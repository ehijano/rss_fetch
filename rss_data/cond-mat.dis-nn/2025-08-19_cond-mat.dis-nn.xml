      <title>Training nonlinear optical neural networks with Scattering Backpropagation</title>

Abstract: As deep learning applications continue to deploy increasingly large artificial neural networks, the associated high energy demands are creating a need for alternative neuromorphic approaches. Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-basis sample-based neural diagonalization for quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating ground-state energies of quantum many-body systems is still a challenging computational task because of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size. Sample-based diagonalization (SBD) methods address this problem by projecting the Hamiltonian onto a subspace spanned by a selected set of basis configurations. In this article, we introduce two neural network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND) and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original computational basis.</description>

      <title>A tale of two localizations: coexistence of flat bands and Anderson localization in a photonics-inspired amorphous system</title>

Abstract: Emerging experimental platforms use amorphousness, a constrained form of disorder, to tailor meta-material properties. We study localization under this type of disorder in a family of 2D models generalizing recent experiments on photonic systems. Models in this family reside on amorphous analogs of kagom\'{e} lattices with fixed coordination number, vary by a tunable synthetic field, and remarkabaly, permit exact results. We observe two kinds of localization that emerge in these models: Anderson localization by amorphous disorder, and the existence of compact, macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagom\'{e} lattices survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and the geometry of the amorphous graph. More surprisingly, for particular values of the field, such states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagom\'{e} lattice in the same field. Outside the flat band, constrained amorphous graph geometry necessitates the existence of a fully delocalized state, near which we observe evidence of a localization-delocalization transition. Our platform serves as a demonstration of how the qualitative behavior of a disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology and lead to localization phenomena unique to amorphous systems that are not observed in their generically disordered counterparts.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>

Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) provide a mechanism for topological phase transitions in disordered systems and have implications for quantum material design. In this work, we investigate the emergence of multiple TAIs in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain subject to Fibonacci modulation, which transforms a trivial band structure into a sequence of topologically nontrivial phases. This behavior is characterized by the appearance of zero-energy modes and changes in the $Z_2$ topological quantum number. As the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases increases, a feature that is closely related to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. In contrast to conventional TAI phases with fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases display multifractal properties. This model can be experimentally realized using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a momentum-space lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal features can be explored through quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</description>

Abstract: We study a quantum interacting spin system subject to an external drive and coupled to a thermal bath of spatially localized vibrational modes, serving as a model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization. We show that even when the many-body eigenstates of the system are ergodic, a sufficiently strong coupling to the bath may effectively localize the spins due to many-body quantum Zeno effect, as manifested by the hole-burning shape of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. Our results provide an explanation of the breakdown of the thermal mixing regime experimentally observed above 4 - 5 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytic expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the \textit{Drosophila} connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</description>

      <title>When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a half-line $x \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) with distribution $Q(u_j)$, located at $x=0$. By computing the first two moments, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant.</description>
