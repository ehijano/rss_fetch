      <title>Receptivity of a supersonic jet due to acoustic excitations near the nozzle lip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate the generation of instability waves triggered by the upstream acoustic forcing near the nozzle lip of a supersonic jet. This represents an important stage, i.e. the jet receptivity, of the screech feedback loop. The upstream acoustic forcing, resulting from the shock-instability interaction, reaches the nozzle lip and excites new shear-layer instability waves. To obtain the newly-excited instability wave, we first determine the scattered sound field due to the upstream forcing using the Wiener-Hopf technique, with the kernel function factored using asymptotic expansions and overlapping approximations. Subsequently, the unsteady Kutta condition is imposed at the nozzle lip, enabling the derivation of the dispersion relation for the newly-excited instability wave. A linear transfer function between the upstream forcing and the newly-excited instability wave is obtained. We calculate the amplitude and phase delay in this receptivity process and examine their variations against the frequency. The phase delay enables us to re-evaluate the phase condition for jet screech and propose a new frequency prediction model. The new model shows improved agreement between the predicted screech frequencies and the experimental data compared to classical models. It is hoped that this model may help in developing a full screech model.</description>

      <title>Compact quantum algorithms that can potentially maintain quantum advantage for solving time-dependent differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs governing fluid flow problems. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms lead to low-depth quantum circuits that protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities that are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) ideal state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called $\textit{QFlowS}$; (b) experiments on a real quantum device (IBM Cairo); and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Increased solidification delays fragmentation and suppresses rebound of impacting drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splat formed after drop impact on supercooled solid surfaces sticks to it. On the contrary, a sublimating supercooled surface such as dry ice inhibits pinning and therefore efficiently rebounds drops made of a variety of liquids. While rebound is expected at lower impact velocities on dry ice, at higher impact velocities the drop fragments leaving behind a trail of smaller droplets. However, it is not known whether rebound can be entirely suppressed or fragmentation be controlled on such surfaces and if it depends on the extent of solidification inside the drop. In this work, we report on the role played by solidification within drops in modifying the outcomes of their impact on the supercooled ultra-low adhesive surface of sublimating dry ice. We show that the solidification thickness depends on the impact velocity and is the primary driver in suppression of rebound and also promotes a delay in fragmentation. Our findings imply that sublimating supercooled surfaces can present a broad spectrum of outcomes from complete bouncing to no-rebound which are not seen in drop impacts on supercooled superhydrophobic surfaces. We attribute this to thermo-elastocapillarity which considers bending of the solidified layer and is used to demarcate regime boundaries and determine the coefficient of restitution during rebound.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of reduced order source terms for a coupled wave-circulation model in the Gulf of Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During hurricanes, coupled wave-circulation models are critical tools for public safety. The standard approach is to use a high fidelity circulation model coupled with a wave model which uses the most advanced source terms. As a result, the models can be highly computationally expensive and so this study investigates the potential consequences of using highly simplified (reduced order) source terms within the wave model component of the coupled wave-circulation model. The trade-off between run time and accuracy with respect to observations is quantified for a set of two storms that impacted the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Ida. Water surface elevations as well as wave statistics (significant wave height, peak period, and mean wave direction) are compared to observations. The usage of the reduced order source terms yielded significant savings in computational cost. Additionally, relatively low amounts of additional error with respect to observations during the simulations with reduced order source terms. However, large changes in global model outputs of the wave statistics were observed based on the choice of source terms particularly near the track of each hurricane.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Digital Twin Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>

      <title>Tip-leakage-flow excited unsteadiness and associated control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tip leakage flow in turbomachinery inherently generates intense unsteady features, named self-excited unsteadiness, which has not been well understood. A Zonalised LES (ZLES) is employed around a linear cascade, with wall-modelled Large Eddy Simulation (LES) forced to be active in the tip region. The simulation is well validated and demonstrated the advantages of effectively reducing the computational effort while maintaining an equivalent prediction accuracy in the region of interest. The time-averaged and spatial-spectral characteristics of tip leakage vortex (TLV) structures are systematically discussed. The self-excited unsteady processes of TLV include unsteady vortex separation inside the tip gap, the tip leakage jet-mainstream interaction, the primary tip leakage vortex (PTLV) wandering motion and the induced separation near endwall. The Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) is used to examine the dominant frequencies and their coherent structures. It is found that these unsteady features change from a single high-frequency mode to a multiple lower-frequencies mode due to the PTLV breakdown. The SPOD and correlation analyses reveal that the self-excited unsteadiness is mainly induced by the interactions between unsteady vortex separation, tip leakage jet, and mainstream. The associated unsteady fluctuations are convected along the tip leakage jet trajectory, causing the wandering motion of PTLV core. Based on the cause of the investigated unsteadiness, a micro-offset tip design is proposed and validated for effectively suppressing this unsteadiness, and associated turbulence generation and hence pressure fluctuations. This work improves the understanding of tip-leakage-flow dynamics and informs the control of the associated unsteady fluid oscillation and noise.</description>
