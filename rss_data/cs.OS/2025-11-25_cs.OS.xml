      <title>Crash-Consistent Checkpointing for AI Training on macOS/APFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning training relies on periodic checkpoints to recover from failures, but unsafe checkpoint installation can leave corrupted files on disk. This paper presents an experimental study of checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation for AI training on macOS/APFS. We implement three write modes with increasing durability guarantees: unsafe (baseline, no fsync), atomic_nodirsync (file-level durability via fsync()), and atomic_dirsync (file + directory durability). We design a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with automatic rollback. Through controlled experiments including crash injection (430 unsafe-mode trials) and corruption injection (1,600 atomic-mode trials), we demonstrate that the integrity guard detects 99.8-100% of corruptions with zero false positives. Performance overhead is 56.5-108.4% for atomic_nodirsync and 84.2-570.6% for atomic_dirsync relative to the unsafe baseline. Our findings quantify the reliability-performance trade-offs and provide deployment guidance for production AI infrastructure.</description>

      <title>eBPF-PATROL: Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation using eBPF in Containerized and Virtualized Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use and adoption of cloud and cloud-native computing, the underlying technologies (i.e., containerization and virtualization) have become foundational. However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (&lt; 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.</description>
