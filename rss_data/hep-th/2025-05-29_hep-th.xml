      <title>The non-relastivistic limit of HSZ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic (NR) limit of HSZ theory, a higher-derivative theory of gravity with exact and manifest T-duality invariance. Since the theory can be formulated using the generalized metric formalism, the HSZ Lagrangian remains convergent to all orders in derivatives when taking the NR limit. In this work, we analyze the three-derivative corrections to the symmetry transformations of the fields in the NR case, as well as the four-derivative action in the absence of a b-field. Interestingly, the corrections to the metric degrees of freedom cannot be fully trivialized, as in the relativistic case, in order to preserve the convergence of the theory. As HSZ theory interpolates order by order between heterotic and bosonic string theories, the results of this work can be interpreted as a truncation of the four-derivative structure of heterotic supergravity in the NR limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity observables: observation, algebras, and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The questions of describing observables and observation in quantum gravity appear to be centrally important to its physics. A relational approach holds significant promise, and a classification of different types of relational observables (gravitationally dressed, field relational, and more general) is outlined. Plausibly gravitationally dressed observables are particularly closely tied to the fundamental structure of the theory. These may be constructed in the quantum theory to leading order in Newton's constant, and raise important questions about localization of information. Approximate localization is given by a "standard dressing" construction of a "gravitational splitting." It is also argued that such gravitational dressings give a generalization of the crossed product construction, reducing to this and yielding type II von Neumann algebras in special cases. Gravity therefore introduces a significantly more general alteration of the algebraic structure of local quantum field theory, also with apparent connections to holography, but whose implications have not been fully understood. In particular, properties of the algebra of gravitationally dressed observables suggest a possible role for other non-algebraic structure on the Hilbert space for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Co-Scaling and Alignment of Electric and Magnetic Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towers of electrically and magnetically charged states in quantum gravity often exhibit two important properties. First, the ratio of the mass (or tension) of electrically charged states to magnetically charged states is of order $e^2/(4\pi)$, which we refer to as "co-scaling." Second, in theories of multiple gauge fields, the towers of states that exhibit co-scaling have charges that point in approximately the same direction in charge space as measured by the gauge kinetic matrix, which we refer to as "alignment." After motivating these ideas with some heuristic arguments, we examine the spectrum of BPS states in the 5d supergravity landscape arising from M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In this setting, every tower of magnetically charged strings is paired with a corresponding tower of electrically charged particles that exhibits co-scaling and rapid alignment. In particular, this motivates a sharp mathematical characterization of the magnetic infinity cone in Calabi-Yau geometry. We conjecture that co-scaling and alignment are universal properties of towers of states which, in some limit in moduli space, have maximally divergent charge-to-mass ratios. Co-scaling is not a general feature of extremal black hole solutions in theories of gauge fields and scalars, suggesting that it is a principle of UV complete quantum gravity. We briefly remark on possible phenomenological applications, including to axion physics.</description>

      <title>From chords to dynamical wormholes with matter: Towards a bulk double-scaled (SYK) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a bulk description of the double-scaled algebra of the DSSYK model. Based on the Hartle-Hawking (HH) state with matter chords, we derive several properties of the DSSYK model with heavy or light matter chords, without making assumptions about the specific dual theory, including its semiclassical thermodynamics, correlation functions, and {Krylov complexity}. These quantities are found from the saddle points of the DSSYK path integral preparing the HH state. We also construct a Lanczos algorithm that simultaneously evaluates Krylov state and operator complexity in the two-sided Hamiltonian system including finite temperature effects. In the semiclassical limit, both measures are encoded in the saddle points of the path integral. They have a bulk interpretation in terms of minimal geodesic lengths in AdS$_2$ space with backreaction due to a shockwave. Different saddle points correspond to geodesic distances with different asymptotic boundary time evolution, and they display different scrambling properties. This allows us to quantize the bulk dual theory of the DSSYK model, which we find is sine dilaton gravity, assuming the Schr\"odinger equation and momentum shift symmetry. At last, we deduce the boundary/bulk dictionary of the double-scaled algebra.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at 4 derivatives, natural variables and BPS limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Einstein-Maxwell theory in $D \geq 3$ spacetime dimensions including all Lorentz-invariant parity-even four-derivative couplings. Building on the results of arXiv:2312.11610, we consider static, charged, asymptotically flat black hole solutions to first order in the higher-derivative expansion. In $D=4$ and $D=5$, we compute the corrected black hole thermodynamics and compare with the Reall-Santos prescription based on the two-derivative background, highlighting a subtlety when both inner and outer horizons are involved. By introducing natural variables, as in arXiv:2304.07320, we recast the on-shell actions in terms of left- and right-moving chemical potentials, which significantly simplifies the analysis.
  We also compute first-order thermodynamic corrections for the most general rotating black holes in $D=4$ and $D=5$, without modifying the background solutions. We identify a novel BPS-like limit in $D=4$, extending known supergravity results beyond their traditional domain of validity. Finally, in $D=5$, the analysis of BPS and almost BPS limits enables an independent verification of the five-dimensional BPS thermodynamics. We clarify the origin of a discrepancy in the literature concerning higher-derivative supergravity localization, sharpening the tension between direct computations and predictions based on the $D=4$/$D=5$ connection.</description>

      <title>On construction of correlation numbers in super Minimal Liouville Gravity in the Ramond sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction of correlation numbers in super minimal Liouville gravity. In particular, we construct the fundamental physical fields in the Ramond sector and compute the three-point correlation number involving two physical fields in the Ramond sector and one in the NS sector. Furthermore, we establish the relation between Ramond physical fields and the elements of the ground ring. Using the higher equations of motion of super Liouville theory, this relation leads to a new representation of the Ramond physical fields. This formulation enables a direct analytic computation of correlation numbers involving Ramond field insertions. As an application, we demonstrate the method in the simplest case of a three-point correlation function.</description>

      <title>Critical phenomenon of quantum BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the thermodynamics of quantum BTZ black holes by treating the quantum backreaction strength parameter $\nu$ as a thermodynamic variable. We find various novel features. The critical point appears at $\nu_c=1$ and a first order transition occurs either below the critical temperature for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ or above the critical temperature for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$. By solving the coexistence curve analytically, we analyze the phase structures and clarify an unexpected discontinuity around the critical point. The critical exponents are significantly different from the mean field theory results and violate one of the scaling laws. We present an intepretation for this by using a universal three scale factor hypothesis for critical behavior of thermodynamic potential. Finally, we prove that given an arbitrarily small angular momenta, only one stable black hole phase can exist and hence no transition will occur.</description>

      <title>Chaos in the holographic matrix models for meson and baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of chaos has become a bridge connecting gravity theory and quantum field theory, especially within the framework of gauge-gravity duality. In this work, we study holographically the chaos in the matrix models for meson and baryon, which are derived from the $\mathrm{D4}/\mathrm{D6}/\overline{\mathrm{D6}}$ approach as a top-down holographic model for QCD. Since these matrix models can be simplified into coupled oscillator models with special parameters, we analyze the chaos in the resultant coupled oscillators. In the analysis of the classical chaos, we calculate numerically the orbits on the Poincar\'e section, the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the total energy and derive the large $N_{c}$ behavior analytically, then discuss the possible phase structure both in the mesonic and baryonic matrix models. These analyses suggest that chaos might serve as an order parameter to detect the gauge theory with spontaneous breaking or restoration of symmetry. Besides, in the analysis of the quantum chaos, we demonstrate the numerical calculation of the OTOCs and analytically derive their large $N_{c}$ behavior by using the perturbation method in quantum mechanics. The numerical calculation illustrates there is a critical temperature, as a critical energy scale, that the OTOC begins to saturate, which covers qualitatively the classical analysis of the Lyapunov exponent. And the large $N_{c}$ analytics indicates the OTOCs are suppressed by the growth of $N_{c}$. Overall, the investigation of chaos in this work may be helpful to identify common features shared by the matrix models, hadronic physics, gauge theory, quantum mechanics, and gravity theory.</description>

      <title>On the spectra of holographic QFTs on constant curvature manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze linear fluctuations of five-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton theories dual to holographic quantum field theories defined on four-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times. We identify the physical propagating scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. For these, we write the linearized bulk field equations as eigenvalue equations. In the dual QFT, the eigenstates correspond to towers of spin-0 and spin-2 particles propagating on $(A)dS_4$ associated to gauge-invariant composite states. Using particular care in treating special ``zero-modes,'' we show in general that, for negative curvature, the particle spectra are always discrete, whereas for positive curvature they always have a continuous component starting at $m^2 = (9/4)\alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha$ is the $(A)dS_4$ radius. We numerically compute the spectra in a concrete model characterized by a polynomial dilaton bulk potential admitting holographic RG-flow solutions with a UV and IR fixed points. In this case, we find no discrete spectrum and no perturbative instabilities.</description>

      <title>Associators for AdS string amplitude building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that building blocks for open- and closed-string amplitudes on AdS are generated by the Drinfeld and Deligne associator, respectively. Our formalism lifts the known associator recursions for flat-space string amplitudes to the AdS picture. This delivers another proof that the AdS building blocks admit low-energy expansions with (single-valued) multiple zeta values as coefficients and provides all-order relations for the integral expressions.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Causality Constraints on Black Hole Thermodynamics in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study causality constraints on black hole thermodynamics in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian is taken to be an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. By requiring the absence of superluminal propagation, we show that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal black holes exhibits a certain monotonicity previously studied in the context of the weak gravity conjecture. Furthermore, under the same condition, we demonstrate that the entropy-to-mass-squared ratio of black holes, which we interpret as an entropy density, decreases monotonically with increasing mass, while keeping the mass-to-charge ratio fixed. This new monotonicity property extends previous studies on the positivity of four-derivative corrections to black hole entropy in the microcanonical ensemble to all orders in nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their gravity duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their holographic duals. On the field theory side, we focus on the case with scaling exponent $z=0$ in two and three spacetime dimensions. These theories exhibit infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras, including supertranslations and superrotations, and are closely related to, but distinct from, Warped Conformal Field Theories. We construct the associated Carrollian stress tensor, derive its transformation properties, and analyse the structure of correlation functions under different choices of vacua. On the gravity side, we identify three and four-dimensional plane wave geometries whose isometry algebras realise the two- and three-dimensional Carroll algebra and anisotropic scale transformations. We propose, for each scaling exponent, a phase space of asymptotically-plane wave spacetimes and show that the residual diffeomorphisms reproduce the expected conformal Carroll field theory algebra, establishing a framework for anisotropic Carrollian holography.</description>

      <title>Retarded Causal Set Propagator in 2D Anti de-Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of Causal Set Theory (CST) as a framework for discretizing $(1+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS$_{1+1}$). In CST, spacetime is modeled as a locally finite, partially ordered set that reflects the causal structure of events. This fundamentally discrete perspective has shown promise in flat spacetime scenarios, while its application to curved geometries is a current field of study. We address this by studying the retarded scalar field propagator on causal sets generated by Poisson sprinkling in AdS$_{1+1}$. We first show the solution of the continuum propagator using the Klein-Gordon equation, solved in terms of geodesic distance. On the discrete side, we employ Shumans path sum method to derive the corresponding propagator, emphasizing that it is valid even in curved manifolds. By performing numerical simulations, we compare the discrete propagator to its continuum counterpart across various curvature scales. Our results show strong agreement and confirm that the causal set propagator accurately captures the effects of curvature without requiring modifications to the flat-space jump amplitudes. These findings affirm the robustness of CST in approximating field propagation in curved spacetimes and strongly support the ability of causal sets to fully capture the geometry of Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we developed a dynamical system in the context of modified $f(R,G,T)$ gravity, where $R$, $G$ and $T$ are Ricci scalar, Gauss-Bonnet term and energy-momentum tensor respectively. Development of the dynamical system is done by first defining 9 dimensionless variables and formulate a ordinary differential equations by taking derivative of the variables with respect to logarithmic time $N=\log a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor. This formulation is applied to the model $f(R,G,T)=\alpha R^{l}+\beta G^{m} + \gamma T^{n} $, and its solutions and their corresponding stabilities are analysed in details. From the plot of density parameters vs $N=-log(1+z)$, we conclude that our Universe is currently dominated by dark energy, which is compatible with current observation. Taking $l=2$, cosmic parameters such as deceleration parameter $(q)$, equation of state $(\omega)$ and state finder parameters are also discussed by fixing one dimensionless variable, showing our Universe's expansion is accelerating with the present value of $q=-0.5$. Present value of $\omega=-0.66$ suggests that our Universe is in Quintessence phase. Lastly, the validity of the model with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model is checked by using 77 Hubble, 15 BAO and 1024 pantheon datasets, which implies that our model is aligned with the $\Lambda$CDM model's bahaviour.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between particle creation and dark components interaction in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the particle creation scenario in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in flat-FLRW metric. For this purpose, from the perspective of thermodynamics and considering an adiabatic universe, we obtain the modified continuity equation in terms of the dynamic number of particles $N$. On the other hand, we obtain Friedmann's equations in $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity and then write down the continuity equations of the components of matter and dark energy, taking into account the interaction between them. In what follows, by establishing a correspondence between the particle production scenario and $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity, we obtain the cosmological parameters in terms of $N$. After that, we find cosmological solutions using power-law cosmology and compare them with Hubble parameter data. Finally, we fit the current model with Hubble data and plot the best fit in terms of the redshift parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum multicriticality and emergent symmetry in Dirac systems with two order parameters at three-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with interacting Dirac excitations can host quantum multicritical behavior near the phase boundaries of the semimetallic and two-ordered phases. We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two order-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To that end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop order in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios: (i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms, and (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the stability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\!+\!N_B)$ symmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of Dirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading critical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order in $\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion coefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ difficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \simeq SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also argued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only exists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^&gt;$. We determine the corresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^&gt;\approx 16.83-7.14\epsilon-7.12\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of $N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality, as induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to distinguish.</description>

      <title>Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.</description>

      <title>A complex logistic equation for universal energy evolution in hadronic elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal evolution equation for elastic scattering of hadrons, derived from Regge field theory (RFT) and solved in closed analytical form. The equation emerges from a complex logistic structure and evolves initial amplitude profiles taken from existing models at fixed energy, reproducing both the differential cross sections and the integrated quantities in a broad energy range. We prove that it admits a unique solution for each initial condition and rigorously satisfies unitarity, the Froissart-Martin bound, and dispersion relations. The dynamics are governed by two physically meaningful parameters: the effective Pomeron mass $\epsilon_{\mathcal{P}}$ and the nonlinear coupling $\lambda$, both fitted at a single energy. Our approach offers a minimal, yet predictive framework for saturation and unitarization in elastic scattering and may provide a useful bridge toward small-$x$ QCD evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of electron positron pair annihilation, driven by strong fields (Inverse Schwinger mechanism) and high-frequency waves, is studied using the Dirac Heisenberg Wigner formalism. In an electron positron plasma, the presence of a strong field leads to both pair creation and annihilation. Depending on plasma properties such as non-degeneracy and the momentum distribution, pair annihilation can dominate over pair creation. The energy released from annihilated pairs can lead to an enhancement of the field energy, provided that the plasma effectively blocks the creation of new pairs. Additionally, pair annihilation induced by high-frequency waves is shown to occur when the photon energy matches the energy of the pairs in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum orbital periods of non-singular Hayward and Bardeen black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on previous studies, universal bounds $4\pi M \leqslant T_{min} \leqslant 6\sqrt{3}\pi M$ were conjectured to be characteristic properties of black hole spacetimes, where $M$ represents the mass of black holes and $T_{min}$ is the minimum orbital periods around black holes. In this work, we explore the minimum orbital periods of objects around Hayward and Bardeen black holes without central singularities. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that both Hayward and Bardeen black holes conform to these bounds. Our results imply that such bounds may be connected to the presence of the black hole horizon rather than the singularity.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity fR=1+cR phi^(n/2) with a kinetic mixing of the form fk=fR^m -- where n=2 and 4 and 0.5&lt;m&lt;10 -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the phi^n potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress on the black hole information paradox has reproduced the Page curve as required by the unitary evolution of the black hole entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the Penrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on the de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter space is the fastest receiver of information in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity, and how they influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. A treatment is provided for the unspecified $f(R, T)$ function, and the nature of the results for a linear $f(R, T)$ function is presented. In the absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is influenced by $X_{TF}$ and the mass function. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy, on the structure scalars has been clearly indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras II: Vertex function and beyond quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of generalized gauge theory called gauge origami, based on the quantum algebraic approach initiated in [arXiv:2310.08545]. In this article, we in particular explore the D2 brane system realized by the screened vertex operators of the corresponding W-algebra. The partition function of this system given by the corresponding conformal block is identified with the vertex function associated with quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties and generalizations, that plays a central role in the quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence. Based on the quantum algebraic perspective, we address three new aspects of the correspondence: (i) Direct equivalence between the electric and magnetic blocks by constructing stable envelopes from the chamber structure of the vertex operators, (ii) Double affine generalization of quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence, and (iii) Conformal block realization of the origami vertex function associated with intersection of quasimaps, that realizes the higher-rank multi-leg Pandharipande-Thomas vertices of 3-fold and 4-fold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

      <title>Transport and response coefficients in second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics with quantum corrections: probing the quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A functional measure encompasses quantum corrections and is explored in the fluid/gravity correspondence. Corrections to response and transport coefficients in the second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are proposed, including the ones to the pressure, the relaxation time, and the shear relaxation. Their dependence on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) temperature sets a temperature dependence on the running parameter encoding the one-loop quantum gravity correction, driven by a functional measure. The experimental range of the bulk viscosity-to-entropy density ratio of the QGP corroborates the existence of the functional measure.</description>

      <title>Large $\theta$ angle in two-dimensional large $N$ $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In confining large $N$ theories with a $\theta$ angle such as four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory, there are multiple metastable vacua and it makes sense to consider the parameter region of ``large $\theta$ of order $N$'' despite the fact that $\theta$ is a $2\pi$-periodic parameter. We investigate this parameter region in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the partition function on $T^2$. When $\theta/N$ is of order $ \mathcal{O}(0.1) $ or less, we get perfectly sensible results for the vacuum energies and decay rates of metastable vacua. However, when $\theta/N$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(1) $, we encounter a problem about saddle points that would give larger contributions to the partition function than the true vacuum. We discuss why it might not be straightforward to resolve this problem.</description>

      <title>Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk.
  Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.
  We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Eigenstate Thermalization for Non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we show that the Semiclassical Einstein's Field Equation can be recovered using the generalized entropy $S_{gen}$. This approach is reminiscent of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, contrary to the entanglement equilibrium approach of deriving the semiclassical Einstein's equation, this approach does not require any such assumptions and still recovers its correct form. Therefore, in a sense, we also show the validity of the semiclassical approximation, a crucial approach for establishing a number of important ideas such as the Hawking effect.</description>

      <title>Analysis of gravitational radiation generated by type D black holes with positive cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criterion for existence of gravitational radiation at conformal infinity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant is applied to a general family of exact solutions representing generic (pairs of) black holes of algebraic type D. Our analysis shows that only accelerating black holes generate gravitational radiation measurable at infinity. This very satisfactory result confirms the goodness of the criterion. To that end, a new metric form of the family of exact type D black holes is constructed -- including any cosmological constant and a (double-aligned) non-null electromagnetic field -- whose expression is suitable for investigation of the asymptotic structure of this large family of spacetimes. The family depends on seven physical parameters, namely $m$, $a$, $l$, $\alpha$, $e$, $g$, and $\Lambda$ that characterize mass, specific angular momentum parameter, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and the cosmological constant, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we have obtained an exact analytical solution of six-dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of both NUT and Maxwell charges. The topology of the horizon is chosen to be the product of two 2-spheres. Upon evaluating the solution, we study the spacetime properties, such as event horizon and singularity, and obtain the ranges of parameter space where the solution is valid. We discuss how the presence of Maxwell charges may impact the solution's asymptotic expansion and what distinctive effects it will bring to the geometry. The thermodynamic properties of the solution are also discussed, emphasizing the interplay between NUT and Maxwell charges.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime and to test gravity theories. These modes extend the standard gravitational wave polarization paradigm and provide novel observational signatures for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Theory and Its Generic Searches in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formalism for quantum entanglement (QE), and study its generic searches at the colliders. For a general quantum system with $N$ particles, we show that the quantum space (the total spin polarization parameter space) is complex projective space, and the classical space (the spin polarization parameter space for classical theory) is the cartesian product of the complex projective spaces. Thus, the quantum entanglement space is the difference of these two spaces. For the $ff$, $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems, we propose their discriminants $\Delta_i$. The corresponding classical spaces are the discriminant locus $\Delta=0$ for $ff$ system, and intersections of the discriminant loci $\Delta_i=0$ for $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems in the quantum space. In particular, for two fermion $ff$ system, we prove that our discriminant criterion is equivalent to the original Peres-Horodecki criterion and the CHSH criterion. And thus our quantum entanglement space is indeed Bell non-local. With the collider searches, we can reconstruct the discriminants from various measurements, and probe the quantum entanglement spaces via a fundamental approach at exact level. In addition, for the specific approach, we present a comprehensive framework to detect quantum entanglement in high-energy multi-particle systems, spanning fermion pairs ($t\bar{t}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$), bosonic pairs ($W^{-}W^{+}$), and hybrid or three-body systems ($W^{-}t$, $ttt$, $t\bar{t}W^{-}$), by diverse observables through angular correlations in decay products. These results establish model-independent methodologies for probing QE across collider experiments, bridging quantum information principles with high-energy phenomenology, while offering novel pathways to explore exotic particles and quantum properties in multi-particle systems.</description>
