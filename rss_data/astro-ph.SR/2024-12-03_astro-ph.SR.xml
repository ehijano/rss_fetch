      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES): IV. An observational run-up of the third r-process peak with Hf, Os, Ir, and Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third r-process peak (Os, Ir, Pt) is poorly understood due to observational challenges, with spectral lines located in the blue or near-ultraviolet region of stellar spectra. These challenges need to be overcome for a better understanding of the r-process in a broader context. To understand how the abundances of the third r-process peak are synthesised and evolve in the Universe, a homogeneous chemical analysis of metal-poor stars using high quality data observed in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum (&lt; 400 nm) is necessary. We provide a homogeneous set of abundances for the third r-process peak (Os, Ir, Pt) and Hf, increasing by up to one order of magnitude their availability in the literature. A classical 1D, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis of four elements (Hf, Os, Ir, Pt) is performed, using ATLAS model atmospheres to fit synthetic spectra in high resolution (&gt; 40,000), high signal-to-noise ratio, of 52 red giants observed with UVES/VLT. Due to the heavy line blending involved, a careful determination of upper limits and uncertainties is done. The observational results are compared with state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis models. Our sample displays larger abundances of Ir (Z=77) in comparison to Os (Z=76), which have been measured in a few stars in the past. The results also suggest decoupling between abundances of third r-process peak elements with respect to Eu (rare earth element) in Eu-poor stars. This seems to contradict a co-production scenario of Eu and the third r-process peak elements Os, Ir, and Pt in the progenitors of these objects. Our results are challenging to explain from the nucleosynthetic point of view: the observationally derived abundances indicate the need for an additional early, primary formation channel (or a non-robust r-process).</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength light curve analysis of the classical nova KT Eri: Optical contribution from a large irradiated accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KT Eri is a classical nova which went into outburst in 2009. Recent photometric analysis in quiescence indicates a relatively longer orbital period of 2.6 days, so that KT Eri could host a very bright accretion disk during the outburst like in the recurrent nova U Sco, the orbital period of which is 1.23 days. We reproduced the optical $V$ light curve as well as the supersoft X-ray light curve of KT Eri in outburst, assuming a large irradiated disk during a nova wind phase of the outburst while a normal size disk after the nova winds stop. This result is consistent with the temporal variation of wide-band $V$ brightness that varies almost with the intermediate-band Str\"omgren $y$ brightness, because the $V$ flux is dominated by continuum radiation, the origin of which is a photospheric emission from the very bright disk. We obtained the white dwarf mass to be $M_{\rm WD}= 1.3\pm0.02 ~M_\odot$, the hydrogen-burning turnoff epoch to be $\sim 240$ days after the outburst, the distance modulus in the $V$ band to be $(m-M)_V=13.4\pm 0.2$, and the distance to KT Eri to be $d=4.2\pm0.4$ kpc for the reddening of $E(B-V)= 0.08$. The peak absolute $V$ brightness is about $M_{V, \rm max}= -8.0$ and the corresponding recurrence time is $\sim 3,000$ yr from its ignition mass together with the mean mass-accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\sim 1\times 10^{-9} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in quiescence. Thus, we suggest that KT Eri is not a recurrent nova.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of Dust Emission in the Young Edge-on Protostellar Disk HH 212</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, since the continuum emission of the disk is more contaminated by the free-free emission at longer wavelengths, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk.</description>

      <title>Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of Three Large Amplitude Contact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed photometric and spectroscopic studies of three large amplitude contact binaries, NSVS 2418361, ATLAS J057.1170+31.2384 and NSVS 7377875. The amplitudes of three systems' light curves are more than 0.7 magnitude. We analyzed the light curves using Wilson-Devinney code to yield physical parameters. The photometric solutions suggested that NSVS 7377875 belongs to an A-subtype contact binary, while the others are classified as W-subtype ones. Furthermore, the mass ratio of NSVS 7377875 is higher than 0.72, so it belongs to H-subtype contact binaries. Since their light curves have unequal height at two maxima which is called O'Connell effect, a dark spot on the primary component for each target was required to get a better fit of light curves. The orbital period investigation shows that the period of NSVS 2418361 is increasing, indicating a mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one, while the other targets exhibit no long-term variation. Our spectral subtraction analysis of LAMOST spectra revealed excess emissions in the $H_\alpha$ line, indicating chromospheric activity in all the three targets. The Gaia distance was applied to estimate the absolute parameters of the three targets, and we obtained their evolutionary state. The relationships between the energy transfer parameter of 76 H-subtype contact binaries and their bolometric luminosity ratios, as well as their contact degree, were presented. We discovered that H-subtype systems have less efficient energy transfer rate, which is corresponding to the conclusion proposed by Csizmadia \&amp; Klagyivik.</description>

      <title>Cross Helicity and the Helium Abundance as a Metric of Solar Wind Heating and Acceleration: Characterizing the Transition from Magnetically Closed to Magnetically Open Solar Wind Sources and Identifying the Origin of the Alf\'enic Slow Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-state solar wind paradigm is based on observations showing that slow and fast solar wind have distinct properties like helium abundances, kinetic signatures, elemental composition, and charge-state ratios. Nominally, the fast wind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open to the heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sources that are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solar wind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm. It has slow wind speeds but is highly Alfv\'enic, i.e. has a high correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations along with low compressibility typical of Alfv\'en waves, which is typically observed in fast wind. Its other properties are also more similar to the fast than slow wind. From 28 years of Wind observations at 1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$), Alfv\'enicity ($\left|\sigma_c\right|$), and solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than the minimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions. We infer that the Alfv\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating from open-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasma from intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications for solar wind heating and acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination of helium abundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar wind categorization scheme.</description>

      <title>Search for and analysis of eclipsing binaries in the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey field. I. RA: $\textbf{23}^h$$\textbf{01}^m$$\textbf{51}^s$, Dec: +34$^\circ$36$^\prime$45$^{\prime \prime}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries (EBs) play an important astrophysical role in studying stellar properties and evolution. By analyzing photometric data in the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey field, RA: $23^h$$01^m$$51.00^s$, Dec: +34$^\circ$36$^\prime$45$^{\prime \prime}$, 48 EBs are detected and 2 are newly discovered. This specific field has been observed 52 times by the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR 9, which facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the EBs. For EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, radial velocity curves were obtained, and their precise orbital parameters were determined by simultaneously analyzing photometric light curves and radial velocity curves. For the other EBs with only photometric light curves, we used the q-search or the temperature ratio method to determine their initial mass ratios and then determined the orbital parameters. It is found that 15 EBs belong to detached systems, 1 to semi-detached systems, and 32 to contact systems. Based on the O-C analysis for 26 EBs with sufficient eclipsing times, we found a long-term decrease in the orbital period of 11 EBs and a continuous increase of 5 EBs, which are due to the material transfer between the two components. The O-C curve of 1 EB shows a distinct periodic variation, which is caused by the light travel time effect, and the third body is likely to be a black hole. By applying the spectral subtraction method to 13 EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, 10 systems exhibit distinct H$\alpha$ emission lines, in which 1 system exhibits double-peaked lines near phases 0.25 and 0.75, implying strong chromospheric activity. In the mass-luminosities and mass-radius distributions, most of the more massive components are less evolved than the less massive ones.</description>

      <title>Disk-Locking Regulates Stellar Rotation in Young Clusters: Insights from NGC 2264</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many young clusters possess extended main sequences, a phenomenon commonly ascribed to stellar rotation. However, the mechanism behind their very wide stellar rotation distributions remains unclear. A proposed explanation is that magnetic star-disk interaction can regulate stellar rotation, i.e., protostars with longer disk lifetimes will eventually evolve into slow rotators, and vice versa. To examine this hypothesis, we took the star forming region, NGC 2264, as a test bed. We have studied its high-mass pre-main-sequence and zero-age main-sequence stars. We found that on average, disk-less pre-main-sequence stars rotate faster than their disk-bearing counterparts. The stellar rotation distribution of its zero-age main-sequence stars is similar to evolved young clusters. We conclude that disk-locking may play a crucial role in the rotational velocity distribution of intermediate-mass early-type stars. We suggest that the observed wide stellar rotation distribution in many young clusters can occur in their early stages.</description>

      <title>Adding RR Lyrae $y$-Band Template Light Curves to gatspy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complement the $y$-band template light curves for RR Lyrae to the well-established template light curves in the $ugriz$-band, where the latter have been adopted in the astroML/gatspy python package as one of the period-search methods for RR Lyrae. These $y$-band template light curves were constructed based on the $z$-band time series data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the $y$-band light curves from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and dedicated $y$-band observations using the Lulin One-meter Telescope for RR Lyrae located in the SDSS Stripe 82 region. These $y$-band template light curves, 9 for the ab-type RR Lyrae and 3 for the c-type RR Lyrae, can be applied in conjunction to the $ugriz$-band template light curves for upcoming sky surveys involving the $y$-band, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with optical survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>

      <title>WR + O binaries as probes of the first phase of mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) and O-star binaries can be the progenitors of X-ray binaries and double black hole binaries, yet their formation is not fully understood. For 21 observed WR+O systems we aim to infer \rev{if the mass-transfer started on the main sequence (Case A) or later (Case B). We also calculate (limits on) the mass transfer efficiency $\beta$, i.e. the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted and the parameter $\gamma$ that denotes the fraction of angular momentum of the binary that is lost per unit mass in units of the average angular momentum of the binary per unit mass. We infer the possible values for the initial masses based on the observed WR masses and models for WR from the literature. With these initial primary masses we can create a grid of possible periods and secondary masses for which we can determine the values $\beta$ and $\gamma$ would have taken for either Case A or Case B mass transfer. Based on this we can also determine which case of mass transfer is most likely for each system. Taking into account the progenitor distribution of WR+O binaries we find that highly non-conservative Case A mass transfer seems to be the most likely scenario for the majority of systems as this can explain 14 out of 21 systems. The angular momentum loss is likely relatively high (typically $\gamma &gt; 1$). Our finding that most systems in our sample experienced Case-A mass transfer is at odds with the expectation that most massive binaries go through Case B mass transfer. This suggest post-case-B systems are significantly underrepresented in the observed WR+O binary population, intrinsically or due to severe selection effects.</description>

      <title>Using Binary Population Synthesis to Examine the Impact of Binary Evolution on the C, N, O, and $S$-Process Yields of Solar-Metallicity Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a significant role in our understanding of the origin of the elements. They contribute to the abundances of C, N, and approximately $50\%$ of the abundances of the elements heavier than iron. An aspect often neglected in studies of AGB stars is the impact of a stellar companion on AGB stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we update the stellar abundances of AGB stars in the binary population synthesis code \textsc{binary\_c} and calibrate our treatment of the third dredge-up using observations of Galactic carbon stars. We model stellar populations of low- to intermediate-mass stars at solar-metallicity and examine the stellar wind contributions to C, N, O, Sr, Ba, and Pb yields at binary fractions between 0 and 1. For a stellar population with a binary fraction of 0.7, we find $\sim 20-25\%$ less C and $s$-process elements ejected than from a population composed of only single stars, and we find little change in the N and O yields. We also compare our models with observed abundances from Ba stars and find our models can reproduce most Ba star abundances, but our population estimates a higher frequency of Ba stars with a surface [Ce/Y] &gt; $+0.2\,$dex. Our models also predict the rare existence of Ba stars with masses $&gt; 10 \text{M}\,_\odot$.</description>

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals a rotational splitting of 2.40 $\mu$Hz and a uniform frequency spacing of 74.6 $\mu$Hz. Subsequently, five sets of rotational splittings were discerned, including a quintuplet and four pairs of doublets, aligning with the characteristics of p-mode rotational splitting. Based on the sets of rotational splittings and the uniform frequency spacing, we finally identified 4 radial modes, 6 dipole modes, and 10 quadrupole modes. Furthermore, we found that the frequency separations within the $\ell$ = 2 sequences show a decreasing trend towards lower-order modes, analogous to the $\ell$ = 0 sequences. A grid of theoretical models were computed to match the identified frequencies, revealing that TIC 120857354 is a main-sequence star with $M$ = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.04 $M_{\odot}$, $Z$ = 0.015 $\pm$ 0.003, $T_{\rm eff}$ = 7441 $\pm$ 370 K, $\log g$ = 4.27 $\pm$ 0.01, $R$ = 1.52 $\pm$ 0.01 $R_{\odot}$, $L$ = 6.33 $\pm$ 1.53 $L_{\odot}$, age = 0.53 $\pm$ 0.07 Gyr, and $X_c/X_0$ = 0.84 $\pm$ 0.05. In-depth analyses suggest that $\ell$ = 2 may be p-dominated mixed modes with pronounced g-mode characteristics, enabling us to probe deeper into interiors of the star and determine the relative size of the convective core to be $R_c/R$ = 0.092 $\pm$ 0.002.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Masses of Red Giants in the Galactic Globular Clusters M9 &amp; M19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismic masses of globular cluster (GC) stars are invaluable to investigate stellar evolution. Previously, only two GCs have been seismically studied. We present new detections of solar-like oscillations in the clusters M9 and M19, focusing on two key areas: stellar mass loss and GC multiple populations. Using K2 photometry, we detect solar-like oscillations in stars on the red giant branch and early asymptotic giant branch. We measure an integrated mass-loss for M9 of $0.16\pm0.02$(rand)$\pm0.03$(sys)$M_{\odot}$ and M19 of $0.33\pm0.03$(rand)$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$(sys)$M_{\odot}$. Comparing these to the mass-loss estimates from previous seismically studied clusters, we derive a preliminary relationship between stellar mass-loss and metallicity for Type I GCs. We find that the mass-loss for M19 -- a Type II GC -- is significantly larger, suggesting Type II clusters follow a different mass-loss-metallicity trend. We also examine the mass distributions in each evolutionary phase for evidence of a bimodality that could indicate mass differences between sub-populations. While no clear bimodality is observed, there is tentative evidence suggesting the presence of two mass populations. Classification through spectroscopic abundances into the sub-populations is needed to verify these findings. This study reinforces that asteroseismology of GC stars provides an excellent testbed for studying stellar evolution. However, to advance the field we need high-quality photometry of more GCs, a goal that could be realised with the upcoming Roman Telescope.</description>

      <title>Sympathetic solar eruption on 2024 February 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a follow-up investigation of the solar eruption originating from active region (AR) 13575 on 2024 February 9. The primary eruption of a hot channel (HC) generates an X3.4 class flare, a full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), and an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave. Interaction between the wave and a quiescent prominence (QP) leads to a large-amplitude, transverse oscillation of QP. After the transverse oscillation, QP loses equilibrium and rises up. The ascending motion of the prominence is coherently detected and tracked up to 1.68 R by the Solar UltraViolet Imager (SUVI) onboard the GOES-16 spacecraft and up to 2.2 R by the Solar Corona Imager (SCI UV) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the ASO-S spacecraft. The velocity increases linearly from 12.3 to 68.5 km s at 18:30 UT. The sympathetic eruption of QP drives the second CME with a typical three-part structure. The bright core comes from the eruptive prominence, which could be further observed up to 3.3 R by the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission. The leading edge of the second CME accelerates continuously from 120 to 277 kms. The EUV wave plays an important role in linking the primary eruption with the sympathetic eruption.</description>

      <title>Failure of a solar filament eruption caused by magnetic reconnection with overlying coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Failure of a filament eruption caused by magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying magnetic field has been previously proposed in numerical simulations. It is, however, rarely observed. In this study, we report the reconnection between an erupting filament and its overlying coronal loops, that results in the failure of the filament eruption. On 2023 September 24, a filament was located in active region 13445. It slowly rose, quickly erupted, rapidly decelerated, and finally stopped, with an untwisting motion. As a failed eruption, the event is associated with an M4.4 flare but no coronal mass ejection. During the eruption, the filament became bright, and the overlying loops appeared first in the high-temperature channels. They have average temperatures of ~12.8 and ~9.6MK, respectively, indicating that both of them were heated. Two sets of new loops, separately connecting the filament endpoints and the overlying loop footpoints, then formed. Subsequently, the heated overlying loops were seen sequentially in the low-temperature channels, showing the cooling process, which is also supported by the light curves. Plasmoids formed, and propagated bidirectionally along the filament and the overlying loops, indicating the presence of plasmoid instability. These results suggest that reconnection occurs between the erupting filament and the overlying loops. The erupting filament eventually disappeared, with the appearance of more newly-formed loops. We propose that the reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying loops ruins the filament completely, and hence results in the failed eruption.</description>

      <title>Exploring the small-scale magnetic fields of the solar analog KIC 8006161 using asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field is a significant and universal physical phenomenon in modern astrophysics. Small-scale magnetic fields are very important in the stellar atmosphere. They are ubiquitous, and strongly couple with the acoustic waves. Therefore, their presence affects the properties of acoustic waves in the stellar outer layer. In the present work, under the assumption that the small-scale magnetic features are the cause of the asteroseismic surface term (the frequency-dependent frequency offset between stars and their models), we explore the strength of such fields in the solar analog KIC 8006161. By considering the effect of small-scale magnetic fields in the stellar photosphere, we use the observed oscillation frequencies to constrain the inner structures and surface small-scale magnetic fields of solar-like star KIC 8006161. To agree with the existing observations, such as oscillation frequencies, and their frequency separation ratios, the theoretical model requires a small-scale magnetic field to form a magnetic-arch splicing layer in the stellar outer atmosphere. The small-scale magnetic field strengths for KIC 8006161 obtained from best-fit model with $Y_{\rm init} = 0.249+1.33Z_{\rm init}$ and $Y_{\rm init}$ as a free parameter, are approximately 96 G and 89 G, respectively. The corresponding locations of the magnetic-arch splicing layer are about $522$ km and 510 km, respectively.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Extraordinary Type V Solar Radio Burst: Nonlinear Evolution of the Electron Two-Stream Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar type V radio bursts are associated with type III bursts. Several processes have been proposed to interpret the association, electron distribution, and emission. We present the observation of a unique type V event observed by e-CALLISTO on 7 May 2021. The type V radio emission follows a group of U bursts. Unlike the unpolarized U bursts, the type V burst is circularly polarized, leaving room for a different emission process. Its starting edge drifts to higher frequency four times slower than the descending branch of the associated U burst. The type V processes seem to be ruled by electrons of lower energy. The observations conform to a coherent scenario where a dense electron beam drives the two-stream instability (causing type III emission) and, in the nonlinear stage, becomes unstable to another instability, previously known as the electron firehose instability (EFI). The secondary instability scatters some beam electrons into velocities perpendicular to the magnetic field and produces, after particle loss, a trapped distribution prone to electron cyclotron masering (ECM). A reduction in beaming and the formation of an isotropic halo are predicted for electron beams continuing to interplanetary space, possibly observable by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Pollution versus diffusion: Abundance patterns of blue horizontal branch stars in globular clusters NGC6388, NGC6397, and NGC6752</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC6388 shows a blue horizontal branch (HB). Helium (He) enrichment, which is correlated with changes in other light elements, might explain this feature. The hot HB stars in the metal-poor globular clusters NGC6397 and NGC6752, instead, show high abundances of heavy elements caused by radiative levitation. Aims: I want to use the abundances of cool blue HB stars in NGC6388 to look for He-enrichment. To exclude effects of radiative levitation for NGC6388 and to investigate the abundance changes caused by radiative levitation, I analysed the blue HB stars in NGC6397 and NGC6752. Methods: I determined effective temperatures and surface gravities from UV-optical photometry and high-resolution spectra together with LTE model spectra. The results were used together with equivalent widths by the GALA program, to provide consistent atmospheric parameters and abundances. Results: For NGC6397 and NGC6752, only moderately hot HB stars were suitable for analysis with GALA. When including literature data, a large scatter is seen at the onset of radiative levitation, followed by increasing abundances up to about 13500 K (Si, Fe), then turning to a plateau (Si) and a forking (Fe) for higher temperatures. NGC6388-4113 shows variations in radial velocity, which may indicate binarity. The metal abundances of the remaining three blue HB stars are consistent with the products of hot hydrogen burning. The data were too noisy to determine He abundances directly. Conclusions: The presence of hot hydrogen burning products in the blue HB stars in NGC6388 could indicate He enrichment. The abundance variations with temperature in moderately hot HB stars in NGC6397 and NGC6752 suggest an influence of parameters beyond rotation and effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Dusty Environment Around RT Vir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared studies of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are critical to our understanding of the formation of cosmic dust. In this investigation, we explore the mid-to-far-infrared emission of oxygen rich AGB star RT Virginis. This optically thin dusty environment has unusual spectral features when compared to other stars in its class. To explore this enigmatic object we use the 1-D radiative transfer modeling code DUSTY. Modeled spectra are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), the Herschel Space Observatory and a host of other sources to determine the properties of RT Vir's circumstellar material. Our models suggest a set of two distant and cool dust shells at low optical depths (tauV,inner = 0.16, tauV,outer = 0.06), with inner dust temperatures: T1 = 330K, T3 = 94K. Overall, these dust shells exhibit a chemical composition consistent with dust typically found around O-rich AGB stars. However, the distribution of materials differs significantly. The inner shell consists of a mixture of silicates, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe, while the outer shell primarily contains crystalline Al2O3 polymorphs. This chemical change is indicative of two distinct epochs of dust formation around RT Vir. These changes in dust composition are driven by either changes in the pressure-temperature conditions around the star, or by a decrease in the C/O ratio due to hot-bottom burning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact phase represents a crossroad in the evolution of massive binary stars. Depending on the internal physics, the predicted end products can vary greatly including various exotic objects such as Be stars, magnetic massive stars, LBVs and gravitational wave sources. This phase also offers a unique observational laboratory to study binary interaction physics. Here, I review the current state of the field of massive contact binary observations. I summarize the techniques available to identify and characterize these systems as well as the limitations of each and the potential biases that they introduce. I present the sample of known confirmed systems and what the bulk statistics can tell us about their formation and evolution. Next I discuss the challenges that these systems pose from a characterization point of view and how we can overcome these. Finally I discuss the future direction of the field on the observational side.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova progenitors: a contemporary view of a long-standing puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are runaway thermonuclear explosions in white dwarfs that result in the disruption of the white dwarf star, and possibly its nearby stellar companion. SNe Ia occur over an immense range of stellar population age and host galaxy environments, and play a critical role in the nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass and iron-group elements, primarily the production of nickel, iron, cobalt, chromium, and manganese. Though the nature of their progenitors is still not well-understood, SNe Ia are unique among stellar explosions in that the majority of them exhibit a systematic lightcurve relation: more luminous supernovae dim more slowly over time than less luminous supernovae in optical light (intrinsically brighter SNe Ia have broader lightcurves). This feature, unique to SNe Ia, is rather remarkable and allows their peak luminosities to be determined with fairly high accuracy out to cosmological distances via measurement of their lightcurve decline. Further, studying SNe Ia gives us important insights into binary star evolution physics, since it is widely agreed that the progenitors of SNe Ia are binary (possibly multiple) star systems. In this review, we give a current update on the different proposed Type Ia supernova progenitors, including descriptions of possible binary star configurations, and their explosion mechanisms, from a theoretical perspective. We additionally give a brief overview of the historical (focusing on the more recent) observational work that has helped the astronomical community to understand the nature of the most important distance indicators in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Modeling High Mass X-ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass ($8-20\,M_{\odot}$) donor stars and a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of $0.1-3.0$. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped leaving a hydrogen envelope of $\lesssim1.0-4.0\,M_\odot$ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last $\sim 10^4-10^5\,\rm yr$, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultra-stripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.</description>

      <title>The Newly Discovered Nova Super-Remnant Surrounding Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis: Will it Light Up During the Coming Eruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A century or less separates the thermonuclear-powered eruptions of recurrent novae in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of massive white dwarfs. The colliding ejecta of successive recurrent nova events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once-in ~80-year recurrent nova event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millenia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [OIII] images, a ~30-parsec-diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Halpha, [NII] and [SII] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically-thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will NOT be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in pre-eruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution. While we cannot predict the morphology or intensity of dust-induced continuum light echoes following the coming flash, we encourage multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging as well as James Webb Space Telescope infrared imaging of T CrB during the year after it erupts.</description>

      <title>Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use the renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Magnetic Field Properties in Bok Globules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bok globules are small, dense clouds that act as isolated precursors for the formation of single or binary stars. Although recent dust polarization surveys, primarily with Planck, have shown that molecular clouds are strongly magnetized, the significance of magnetic fields in Bok globules has largely been limited to individual case studies, lacking a broader statistical understanding. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive optical polarimetric survey of 21 Bok globules. Using Gaia and near-IR photometric data, we produce extinction maps for each target. Using the radiative torque alignment model customized to the physical properties of the Bok globule, we characterize the polarization efficiency of one representative globule as a function of its visual extinction. We thus find our optical polarimetric data to be a good probe of the globule's magnetic field. Our statistical analysis of the orientation of elongated extinction structures relative to the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations shows they do not align strictly parallel or perpendicular. Instead, the data is best explained by a bimodal distribution, with structures oriented at projected angles that are either parallel or perpendicular. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths on the scales probed by optical polarimetric data are measured using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique. We then derive magnetic properties such as Alfv\'en Mach numbers and mass-to-magnetic flux ratios. Our findings statistically place the large-scale (Av &lt; 7 mag) magnetic properties of Bok globules in a dynamically important domain.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial atmospheric ion implantation occurred in the nearside lunar regolith during the history of Earth's dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence of geomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitive geodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear, and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition and poorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHD numerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetized atmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects this transfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signature provides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetized epoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrial atmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunar soils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples are very sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ion implantation, was never smaller than 190 km.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the "Hillas limit" is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles -- those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments -- often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy ($\sim$100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>3D-PDR Orion dataset and NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations for Photodissociation Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel dataset of simulations of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the Orion Bar and provide benchmarks of emulators for the dataset. Numerical models of PDRs are computationally expensive since the modeling of these changing regions requires resolving the thermal balance and chemical composition along a line-of-sight into an interstellar cloud. This often makes it a bottleneck for 3D simulations of these regions. In this work, we provide a dataset of 8192 models with different initial conditions simulated with 3D-PDR. We then benchmark different architectures, focusing on Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ANODE) based models (Code be found at https://github.com/uclchem/neuralpdr). Obtaining fast and robust emulators that can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D simulations of PDRs.</description>

      <title>A simultaneous explanation of XTE J1814-338 and HESS J1731-347 objects using ${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$ condensates</title>

Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present srtudy, we investigate the possible existence of neutral anti-kaons and negative charged kaons in neutron stars by employing the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to explain all objects simultaneously, it is essential to consider two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a PRS associated with FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB ($\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\sim$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the respect to the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies, indicates a steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-3 GHz range and the presence of a possible synchrotron peak at $\sim$1 GHz. Optical observations performed with the LBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\sim$1 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with SFR $\sim 1 M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\sim10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>UV-processing of icy pebbles in the outer parts of VSI-turbulent disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Icy dust particles emerge in star-forming clouds and are subsequently incorporated in protoplanetary disks, where they coagulate into larger pebbles up to mm in size. In the disk midplane, ices are shielded from UV radiation, but moderate levels of disk turbulence can lift small particles to the disk surface, where they can be altered, or destroyed. Nevertheless, studies of comets and meteorites generally find that ices at least partly retained their interstellar medium (ISM) composition before being accreted onto these minor bodies. Here we model this process through hydrodynamical simulations with VSI-driven turbulence in the outer protoplanetary disk. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5 D global accretion setup and include Lagrangian dust particles of 0.1 and 1 mm sizes. In a post-processing step, we use the RADMC3D code to generate the local UV radiation field to assess the level of ice processing of pebbles. We find that a small fraction ($\sim$17$\%$) of 100 $\mu$m size particles are frequently lifted up to $Z/R=0.2$ which can result in the loss of their pristine composition as their residence time in this layer allows for effective CO and water photodissociation. The larger 1 mm size particles remain UV-shielded in the disk midplane throughout the dynamical evolution of the disk. Our results indicate that the assembly of icy bodies via the accretion of drifting mm-size icy pebbles can explain the presence of pristine ice from the ISM, even in VSI-turbulent disks. Nevertheless, particles $\leq$ 100 $\mu$m experience efficient UV processing and may mix with unaltered icy pebbles, resulting in a less ISM-like composition in the midplane.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear: implications for reconnection onset in the Alfv\'enic solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.</description>

      <title>A new investigation on the characteristics of a W UMa type system LO Andromedae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type system LO Andromedae (LO And) was observed over nine nights at Durham to fully investigate its physical properties and update its stellar parameters. After obtaining the observational data in both V-filter and B-filter, the Gaia CCD images of LO And were extracted from the Astrolab internal archive using Linux commands. By applying the "Nightfall" program and local Python scripts, the calibrated light curves of LO And can be plotted, phase-folded, and fitted to derive the period of this system as $0.3804573 \pm 0.0000482\, \mathrm{d}$. Then, 2D chi-squared heat maps were illustrated to determine LO And's best-fit stellar parameters and estimate their uncertainties, including the mass ratio $q = 0.371 \pm 0.207$, the inclination $i = 78.5 \pm 3.8\, \mathrm{deg}$, the primary temperature $T_1 = 6290 \pm 358\, \mathrm{K}$, the secondary temperature $T_2 = 6449 \pm 445\, \mathrm{K}$, and two fill factors $f_1 = f_2 = 1.02258$. In addition, the "Nightfall" program built the 3D models and evaluated the spot distribution parameters to visualize the configuration of LO And. There were seven new eclipsing timings added in this study to reconstruct the O-C diagram together with LO And's previous observational data. It was clearly found that the period of LO And is currently undergoing an accelerated increase with a change rate $d\mathrm{P}/d\mathrm{t} = 2.27 \times 10^{-7}\, \mathrm{day\, yr^{-1}}$, which was attributed to the mass transfer in this system with a transfer rate $dM_1/d\mathrm{t} = 1.43 \times 10^{-7}\, \mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$ and the light time effect caused by the possible existence of a third star $M_3 = 0.224\, M_\odot$ orbiting around LO And.</description>

      <title>Rotation at the Fully Convective Boundary: Insights from Wide WD + MS Binary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrochronology, a valuable tool for determining ages of low-mass stars where other techniques fail, relies on accurate calibration. We present a sample of 185 wide ($&gt;$$100$ au) white dwarf + main sequence (WD + MS) binaries. Total ages of WDs are computed using all-sky survey photometry, Gaia parallaxes, and WD atmosphere models. Using a magnetic braking law calibrated against open clusters, along with assumptions about initial conditions and angular momentum transport, we construct gyrochrones to predict the rotation periods of MS stars. Both data and models show that, at the fully convective boundary (FCB), MS stars with WD ages up to 7.5 Gyr and within a $&lt;50$ K effective temperature range experience up to a threefold increase in rotation period relative to stars slightly cooler than the FCB. We suggest that rapid braking at this boundary is driven by a sharp rise in the convective overturn timescale ($\tau_{\mathrm{cz}}$) caused by structural changes between partially and fully convective stars and the $^3 \textrm{He}$ instability occurring at this boundary. While the specific location in mass (or temperature) of this feature varies with model physics, we argue that its existence remains consistent. Stars along this feature exhibit rotation periods that can be mapped, within 1$\sigma$, to a range of gyrochrones spanning $\approx 6$ Gyr. Due to current temperature errors ($\simeq$$50$ K), this implies that a measured rotation period cannot be uniquely associated to a single gyrochrone, implying that gyrochronology may not be feasible for M dwarfs very close to the FCB.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>

Abstract: Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>

Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>

Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ II: Hierarchical Structure Analysis of the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the way station at the heart of our Milky Way Galaxy, connecting gas flowing in from Galactic scales with the central nucleus. Key open questions remain about its 3-D structure, star formation properties, and role in regulating this gas inflow. In this work, we identify a hierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density maps from Paper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$), $T_{\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments) properties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). We compare these properties with regions in the Milky Way disk and external galaxies. Despite the fact that the CMZ overall is well below the Gao-Solomon dense gas star-formation relation (and in modest agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), individual structures on the scale of molecular clouds generally follow these star-formation relations and agree well with other Milky Way and extragalactic regions. We find that individual CMZ structures require a large external pressure ($P_e$/k$_B$ $&gt; 10^{7-9}$ K cm$^{-3}$) to be considered bound, however simple estimates suggest that most CMZ molecular-cloud-sized structures are consistent with being in pressure-bounded virial equilibriuim. We perform power-law fits to the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) of the inner 100 pc, SgrB2, and the outer 100 pc of the CMZ as well as several individual molecular cloud structures and find generally steeper power-law slopes ($-9&lt;\alpha&lt;-2$) compared with the literature ($-6 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1$).</description>
