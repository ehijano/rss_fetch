      <title>Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of bacterial growth by antibiotics : A simple view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02944v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth in bacterial populations generally depends on the environment (availability and quality of nutrients, presence of a toxic inhibitor, product inhibition..). Here, we build a model to describe the action of a bacteriostatic antibiotic, assuming that this drug inhibits an essential autocatalytic cycle involved in the cell metabolism. The model recovers known growth laws, can describe various types of antibiotics and confirms the existence of two distinct regimes of growth-dependent susceptibility, previously identified only for ribosome targeting antibiotics. Interestingly, below a certain threshold in terms of antibiotic concentration, a coexistence between two values of the growth rate is possible, which has also been observed experimentally. Interesting extensions of the model include the antagonistic effect of two drugs targeting different autocatalytic cycles or the production of an inhibiting waste.</description>
