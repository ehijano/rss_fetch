      <title>Evolution of cooperation with Q-learning: the impact of information perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of human beings manifests in a remarkable diversity of responses to intricate environments, enabling us to approach problems from varied perspectives. However, in the study of cooperation, existing research within the reinforcement learning framework often assumes that individuals have access to identical information when making decisions, which contrasts with the reality that individuals frequently perceive information differently. In this study, we employ the Q-learning algorithm to explore the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. We demonstrate that the evolutionary processes differ significantly across three distinct information perception scenarios, highlighting the critical role of information structure in the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario reveals a complex dynamical process, including the emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction of cooperation, mirroring psychological shifts observed in human behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of information structure in fostering cooperation, offering new insights into the establishment of stable cooperative relationships among humans.</description>

      <title>Online Physics-Informed Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has received increasing research attention due to its capability to analyze and model complex dynamical systems. However, it faces challenges in computational efficiency, noise sensitivity, and difficulty adhering to physical laws, which negatively affect its performance. Addressing these issues, we present Online Physics-informed DMD (OPIDMD), a novel adaptation of DMD into a convex optimization framework. This approach not only ensures convergence to a unique global optimum, but also enhances the efficiency and accuracy of modeling dynamical systems in an online setting. Leveraging the Bayesian DMD framework, we propose a probabilistic interpretation of Physics-informed DMD (piDMD), examining the impact of physical constraints on the DMD linear operator. Further, we implement online proximal gradient descent and formulate specific algorithms to tackle problems with different physical constraints, enabling real-time solutions across various scenarios. Compared with existing algorithms such as Exact DMD, Online DMD, and piDMD, OPIDMD achieves the best prediction performance in short-term forecasting, e.g. an $R^2$ value of 0.991 for noisy Lorenz system. The proposed method employs a time-varying linear operator, offering a promising solution for the real-time simulation and control of complex dynamical systems.</description>
