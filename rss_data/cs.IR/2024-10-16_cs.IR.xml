      <title>Post-Userist Recommender Systems : A Manifesto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define userist recommendation as an approach to recommender systems framed solely in terms of the relation between the user and system. Post-userist recommendation posits a larger field of relations in which stakeholders are embedded and distinguishes the recommendation function (which can potentially connect creators with audiences) from generative media. We argue that in the era of generative media, userist recommendation becomes indistinguishable from personalized media generation, and therefore post-userist recommendation is the only path forward for recommender systems research.</description>

      <title>Triple Modality Fusion: Aligning Visual, Textual, and Graph Data with Large Language Models for Multi-Behavior Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing the performance of personalized recommendation systems. Traditional models, which often rely on singular data sources, lack the depth needed to accurately capture the multifaceted nature of item features and user behaviors. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-behavior recommendations, leveraging the fusion of triple-modality, which is visual, textual, and graph data through alignment with large language models (LLMs). By incorporating visual information, we capture contextual and aesthetic item characteristics; textual data provides insights into user interests and item features in detail; and graph data elucidates relationships within the item-behavior heterogeneous graphs. Our proposed model called Triple Modality Fusion (TMF) utilizes the power of LLMs to align and integrate these three modalities, achieving a comprehensive representation of user behaviors. The LLM models the user's interactions including behaviors and item features in natural languages. Initially, the LLM is warmed up using only natural language-based prompts. We then devise the modality fusion module based on cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to integrate different modalities from other models into the same embedding space and incorporate them into an LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving recommendation accuracy. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the TMF.</description>

      <title>Comprehending Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the introduction of knowledge graphs (KGs) has significantly advanced recommender systems by facilitating the discovery of potential associations between items. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, most KGs suffer from missing facts or limited scopes. This can lead to biased knowledge representations, thereby constraining the model's performance. Second, existing methods typically convert textual information into IDs, resulting in the loss of natural semantic connections between different items. Third, existing methods struggle to capture high-order relationships in global KGs due to their inefficient layer-by-layer information propagation mechanisms, which are prone to introducing significant noise. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called CoLaKG, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-aware recommendation. The extensive world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to supplement KGs. Additionally, the strong text comprehension abilities of LLMs allow for a better understanding of semantic information. Based on this, we first extract subgraphs centered on each item from the KG and convert them into textual inputs for the LLM. The LLM then outputs its comprehension of these item-centered subgraphs, which are subsequently transformed into semantic embeddings. Furthermore, to utilize the global information of the KG, we construct an item-item graph using these semantic embeddings, which can directly capture higher-order associations between items. Both the semantic embeddings and the structural information from the item-item graph are effectively integrated into the recommendation model through our designed representation alignment and neighbor augmentation modules. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Cause Deconfounding for Recommender Systems with Latent Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommender systems, various latent confounding factors (e.g., user social environment and item public attractiveness) can affect user behavior, item exposure, and feedback in distinct ways. These factors may directly or indirectly impact user feedback and are often shared across items or users, making them multi-cause latent confounders. However, existing methods typically fail to account for latent confounders between users and their feedback, as well as those between items and user feedback simultaneously. To address the problem of multi-cause latent confounders, we propose a multi-cause deconfounding method for recommender systems with latent confounders (MCDCF). MCDCF leverages multi-cause causal effect estimation to learn substitutes for latent confounders associated with both users and items, using user behaviour data. Specifically, MCDCF treats the multiple items that users interact with and the multiple users that interact with items as treatment variables, enabling it to learn substitutes for the latent confounders that influence the estimation of causality between users and their feedback, as well as between items and user feedback. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate the soundness of our MCDCF method. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MCDCF method effectively recovers latent confounders related to users and items, reducing bias and thereby improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>QUIDS: Query Intent Generation via Dual Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query understanding is a crucial component of Information Retrieval (IR), aimed at identifying the underlying search intent of textual queries. However, most existing approaches oversimplify this task into query classification or clustering, which fails to fully capture the nuanced intent behind the query. In this paper, we address the task of query intent generation: to automatically generate detailed and precise intent descriptions for search queries using relevant and irrelevant documents given a query. These intent descriptions can help users understand why the search engine considered the top-ranked documents relevant, and provide more transparency to the retrieval process. We propose a dual-space model that uses semantic relevance and irrelevance information in the returned documents to explain the understanding of the query intent. Specifically, in the encoding process, we project, separate, and distinguish relevant and irrelevant documents in the representation space. Then, we introduce a semantic decoupling model in the novel disentangling space, where the semantics of irrelevant information are removed from the relevant space, ensuring that only the essential and relevant intent is captured. This process refines the understanding of the query and provides more accurate explanations for the search results. Experiments on benchmark data demonstrate that our methods produce high-quality query intent descriptions, outperforming existing methods for this task, as well as state-of-the-art query-based summarization methods. A token-level visualization of attention scores reveals that our model effectively reduces the focus on irrelevant intent topics. Our findings open up promising research and application directions for query intent generation, particularly in exploratory search.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Dual Latent Confounding Biases in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are extensively utilised across various areas to predict user preferences for personalised experiences and enhanced user engagement and satisfaction. Traditional recommender systems, however, are complicated by confounding bias, particularly in the presence of latent confounders that affect both item exposure and user feedback. Existing debiasing methods often fail to capture the complex interactions caused by latent confounders in interaction data, especially when dual latent confounders affect both the user and item sides. To address this, we propose a novel debiasing method that jointly integrates the Instrumental Variables (IV) approach and identifiable Variational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) for Debiased representation learning in Recommendation systems, referred to as IViDR. Specifically, IViDR leverages the embeddings of user features as IVs to address confounding bias caused by latent confounders between items and user feedback, and reconstructs the embedding of items to obtain debiased interaction data. Moreover, IViDR employs an Identifiable Variational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) to infer identifiable representations of latent confounders between item exposure and user feedback from both the original and debiased interaction data. Additionally, we provide theoretical analyses of the soundness of using IV and the identifiability of the latent representations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IViDR outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing bias and providing reliable recommendations.</description>

      <title>Unifying Economic and Language Models for Enhanced Sentiment Analysis of the Oil Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crude oil, a critical component of the global economy, has its prices influenced by various factors such as economic trends, political events, and natural disasters. Traditional prediction methods based on historical data have their limits in forecasting, but recent advancements in natural language processing bring new possibilities for event-based analysis. In particular, Language Models (LM) and their advancement, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), have shown potential in classifying vast amounts of natural language. However, these LMs often have difficulty with domain-specific terminology, limiting their effectiveness in the crude oil sector. Addressing this gap, we introduce CrudeBERT, a fine-tuned LM specifically for the crude oil market. The results indicate that CrudeBERT's sentiment scores align more closely with the WTI Futures curve and significantly enhance price predictions, underscoring the crucial role of integrating economic principles into LMs.</description>

      <title>RosePO: Aligning LLM-based Recommenders with Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems, which usually adapt a pre-trained LLM to the recommendation scenario through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative relationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a "helpful and harmless" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework -- Recommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO), which better aligns with customized human values during the post-training stage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that naturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored for enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases to promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present in automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized smoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation performance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.</description>

      <title>GeoLife+: Large-Scale Simulated Trajectory Datasets Calibrated to the GeoLife Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing individual human trajectory data helps our understanding of human mobility and finds many commercial and academic applications. There are two main approaches to accessing trajectory data for research: one involves using real-world datasets like GeoLife, while the other employs simulations to synthesize data. Real-world data provides insights from real human activities, but such data is generally sparse due to voluntary participation. Conversely, simulated data can be more comprehensive but may capture unrealistic human behavior. In this Data and Resource paper, we combine the benefit of both by leveraging the statistical features of real-world data and the comprehensiveness of simulated data. Specifically, we extract features from the real-world GeoLife dataset such as the average number of individual daily trips, average radius of gyration, and maximum and minimum trip distances. We calibrate the Pattern of Life Simulation, a realistic simulation of human mobility, to reproduce these features. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm to calibrate the parameters of the simulation to mimic the GeoLife features. For this calibration, we simulated numerous random simulation settings, measured the similarity of generated trajectories to GeoLife, and iteratively (over many generations) combined parameter settings of trajectory datasets most similar to GeoLife. Using the calibrated simulation, we simulate large trajectory datasets that we call GeoLife+, where + denotes the Kleene Plus, indicating unlimited replication with at least one occurrence. We provide simulated GeoLife+ data with 182, 1k, and 5k over 5 years, 10k, and 50k over a year and 100k users over 6 months of simulation lifetime.</description>

      <title>Online Digital Investigative Journalism using SociaLens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media companies witnessed a significant transformation with the rise of the internet, bigdata, machine learning (ML) and AI. Recent emergence of large language models (LLM) have added another aspect to this transformation. Researchers believe that with the help of these technologies, investigative digital journalism will enter a new era. Using a smart set of data gathering and analysis tools, journalists will be able to create data driven contents and insights in unprecedented ways. In this paper, we introduce a versatile and autonomous investigative journalism tool, called {\em SociaLens}, for identifying and extracting query specific data from online sources, responding to probing queries and drawing conclusions entailed by large volumes of data using ML analytics fully autonomously. We envision its use in investigative journalism, law enforcement and social policy planning. The proposed system capitalizes on the integration of ML technology with LLMs and advanced bigdata search techniques. We illustrate the functionality of SociaLens using a focused case study on rape incidents in a developing country and demonstrate that journalists can gain nuanced insights without requiring coding expertise they might lack. SociaLens is designed as a ChatBot that is capable of contextual conversation, find and collect data relevant to queries, initiate ML tasks to respond to queries, generate textual and visual reports, all fully autonomously within the ChatBot environment.</description>

      <title>The Moral Case for Using Language Model Agents for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our information and communication environment has fallen short of the ideals that networked global communication might have served. Identifying all the causes of its pathologies is difficult, but existing recommender systems very likely play a contributing role. In this paper, which draws on the normative tools of philosophy of computing, informed by empirical and technical insights from natural language processing and recommender systems, we make the moral case for an alternative approach. We argue that existing recommenders incentivise mass surveillance, concentrate power, fall prey to narrow behaviourism, and compromise user agency. Rather than just trying to avoid algorithms entirely, or to make incremental improvements to the current paradigm, researchers and engineers should explore an alternative paradigm: the use of language model (LM) agents to source and curate content that matches users' preferences and values, expressed in natural language. The use of LM agents for recommendation poses its own challenges, including those related to candidate generation, computational efficiency, preference modelling, and prompt injection. Nonetheless, if implemented successfully LM agents could: guide us through the digital public sphere without relying on mass surveillance; shift power away from platforms towards users; optimise for what matters instead of just for behavioural proxies; and scaffold our agency instead of undermining it.</description>

      <title>A Practice-Friendly LLM-Enhanced Paradigm with Preference Parsing for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training paradigm integrating large language models (LLM) is gradually reshaping sequential recommender systems (SRS) and has shown promising results. However, most existing LLM-enhanced methods rely on rich textual information on the item side and instance-level supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to inject collaborative information into LLM, which is inefficient and limited in many applications. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a practice-friendly LLM-enhanced paradigm with preference parsing (P2Rec) for SRS. Specifically, in the information reconstruction stage, we design a new user-level SFT task for collaborative information injection with the assistance of a pre-trained SRS model, which is more efficient and compatible with limited text information. Our goal is to let LLM learn to reconstruct a corresponding prior preference distribution from each user's interaction sequence, where LLM needs to effectively parse the latent category of each item and the relationship between different items to accomplish this task. In the information augmentation stage, we feed each item into LLM to obtain a set of enhanced embeddings that combine collaborative information and LLM inference capabilities. These embeddings can then be used to help train various future SRS models. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our TSLRec on three SRS benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>PromptDSI: Prompt-based Rehearsal-free Instance-wise Incremental Learning for Document Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for efficient document retrieval without relying on external indexes. However, DSI needs full re-training to handle updates in dynamic corpora, causing significant computational inefficiencies. We introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based rehearsal-free approach for instance-wise incremental learning document retrieval. PromptDSI attaches prompts to the frozen PLM's encoder of DSI, leveraging its powerful representation to efficiently index new corpora while maintaining a balance between stability and plasticity. We eliminate the initial forward pass of prompt-based continual learning methods that doubles training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys. This strategy ensures diverse and effective prompt usage, addressing the challenge of parameter underutilization caused by the collapse of the query-key matching mechanism. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that BERT-based PromptDSI matches IncDSI in managing forgetting while improving new corpora performance by more than 4% Hits@10 on NQ320k and upto 3% MRR@10 on MS MARCO 300k.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</description>

      <title>Beyond Inter-Item Relations: Dynamic Adaption for Enhancing LLM-Based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRS) predict the next items that users may prefer based on user historical interaction sequences. Inspired by the rise of large language models (LLMs) in various AI applications, there is a surge of work on LLM-based SRS. Despite their attractive performance, existing LLM-based SRS still exhibit some limitations, including neglecting intra-item relations, ignoring long-term collaborative knowledge and using inflexible architecture designs for adaption. To alleviate these issues, we propose an LLM-based sequential recommendation model named DARec. Built on top of coarse-grained adaption for capturing inter-item relations, DARec is further enhanced with (1) context masking that models intra-item relations to help LLM better understand token and item semantics in the context of SRS, (2) collaborative knowledge injection that helps LLM incorporate long-term collaborative knowledge, and (3) a dynamic adaption mechanism that uses Bayesian optimization to flexibly choose layer-wise adapter architectures in order to better incorporate different sequential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARec can effectively handle sequential recommendation in a dynamic and adaptive manner.</description>

      <title>DyVo: Dynamic Vocabularies for Learned Sparse Retrieval with Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models use vocabularies from pre-trained transformers, which often split entities into nonsensical fragments. Splitting entities can reduce retrieval accuracy and limits the model's ability to incorporate up-to-date world knowledge not included in the training data. In this work, we enhance the LSR vocabulary with Wikipedia concepts and entities, enabling the model to resolve ambiguities more effectively and stay current with evolving knowledge. Central to our approach is a Dynamic Vocabulary (DyVo) head, which leverages existing entity embeddings and an entity retrieval component that identifies entities relevant to a query or document. We use the DyVo head to generate entity weights, which are then merged with word piece weights to create joint representations for efficient indexing and retrieval using an inverted index. In experiments across three entity-rich document ranking datasets, the resulting DyVo model substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

      <title>FLEX: Expert-level False-Less EXecution Metric for Reliable Text-to-SQL Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems have become crucial for translating natural language into SQL queries in various industries, enabling non-technical users to perform complex data operations. The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most prevalent evaluation metric, still shows many false positives and negatives. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated. This work contributes to a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of text-to-SQL systems, potentially reshaping our understanding of state-of-the-art performance in this field.</description>

      <title>$\textit{lucie}$: An Improved Python Package for Loading Datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The University of California--Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning (ML) Repository (UCIMLR) is consistently cited as one of the most popular dataset repositories, hosting hundreds of high-impact datasets. However, a significant portion, including 28.4% of the top 250, cannot be imported via the $\textit{ucimlrepo}$ package that is provided and recommended by the UCIMLR website. Instead, they are hosted as .zip files, containing nonstandard formats that are difficult to import without additional ad hoc processing. To address this issue, here we present $\textit{lucie}$ -- $\underline{l}oad$ $\underline{U}niversity$ $\underline{C}alifornia$ $\underline{I}rvine$ $\underline{e}xamples$ -- a utility that automatically determines the data format and imports many of these previously non-importable datasets, while preserving as much of a tabular data structure as possible. $\textit{lucie}$ was designed using the top 100 most popular datasets and benchmarked on the next 130, where it resulted in a success rate of 95.4% vs. 73.1% for $\textit{ucimlrepo}$. $\textit{lucie}$ is available as a Python package on PyPI with 98% code coverage.</description>
