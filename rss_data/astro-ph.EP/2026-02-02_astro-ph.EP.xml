      <title>Warps survive beyond fly-by encounters in protoplanetary disks. RW Aur A as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar fly-bys can have multiple dynamical effects on protoplanetary disks, including warping and the excitation of spiral arms. Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5{\deg} can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: Detection of a nearby world orbiting in the habitable zone of Gl725B achieved by correcting strong telluric contamination in near-infrared radial velocities with WAPITI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are prime targets in the search for exoplanets because of their prevalence and because low-mass planets can be better detected with radial velocity (RV) methods. In particular, the near-infrared (NIR) spectral domain offers an increased RV sensitivity and potentially reduced stellar activity signals. Howevern precise NIR RV measurements can be strongly affected by telluric absorption lines from the Earth's atmosphere.
  We searched for planets orbiting Gl 725 B, a nearby late-M dwarf at $3.5$ pc, using high-precision SPIRou RV observations. We assessed the impact of telluric contamination and evaluated the performance of the weighted principal component analysis reconstruction method (WAPITI), designed to mitigate these systematics and improve planet detectability.
  Using synthetic and observational SPIRou data, we simulated telluric effects on RVs under varying barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) conditions and applied WAPITI to correct line-by-line RVs. The method was tested through injection-recovery experiments and applied to real SPIRou observations of Gl 725 B.
  WAPITI efficiently corrects telluric contamination in simulated and real datasets, enhancing the detectability and accuracy of planetary signals. We identify a two-planet system around Gl 725 B composed of a candidate inner planet (Gl 725 Bb) with a period of $4.765 \pm 0.004$ days and semi-amplitude $1.4 \pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$, and a confirmed outer planet (Gl 725 Bc) with a period of $37.90 \pm 0.17$ days and semi-amplitude $1.7 \pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$. Their minimum masses are $1.5 \pm 0.4$ and $3.5 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$, respectively, and the outer planet lies in the habitable zone. Using a multi-dimensional Gaussian process framework to model stellar activity, we also recover a stellar rotation period of $105.1 \pm 3.3$ days.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the C/O ratio in the planet-forming environments around very-low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\sim0.1~M\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\sim10^{29}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\mathrm{gas}&gt;200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.</description>

      <title>Inhibiting Conduction by He Mixing in Interiors of Jupiter and Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the electrical and thermal conductivities and structural properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures under thermodynamic conditions within and beyond the immiscibility range is very important to predict the thermal evolution and internal structure of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tidal Heating and Volatile Budgets on the Outgassed Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 55 Cancri e is a $\sim$8 Gyr rocky world (1.95 $R_\oplus$, 8.8 $M_\oplus$) orbiting a K-type star. JWST observations suggest a carbon-dominated atmosphere (CO$_2$/CO) over a global magma ocean ($&gt;$3000 K). We suggest that any CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with trace H$_2$O/O$_2$, likely arises from outgassing of its initial volatile reservoir. As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\sim$10 Myr. With both at 10 wt%, greenhouse warming alone can prolong outgassing up to $\sim$30 Myr. Our model shows that tidal heating can reduce the volatile threshold required to maintain a high surface temperature ($\sim$3200 K at $e = 0.005$) and delay outgassing of additional volatiles to the present-day. However, higher tidal heating presents a tradeoff between prolonging tenuous outgassing and enlarging the overall size of the secondary atmosphere. Tidally-enhanced outgassing may produce minor pressure variations that could contribute to the observed phase-curve variability. Additionally, our model shows that tidal heating strongly controls outgassing in the planet's young-to-midlife stage, then shifts toward a volatile inventory dependence at mature ages. Using 55 Cnc e, we present a framework to prioritize atmosphere detections on rocky ultra short period (USP) magma ocean planets, linking age-dependent tidal heating and volatile inventory to the formation and size of secondary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Sculpting of Martian brain terrain reveals the drying of ancient Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Martian brain terrain (MBT), characterized by its unique brain-like morphology, is a potential geological archive for finding hints of paleoclimatic conditions during its formation period. The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $&lt;10\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $&lt;0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\sim 3$ meters over the past $\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state.</description>

      <title>HEP digital micromirror devices for precision solar spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the motivation and early tests for a novel solar instrument that will harness the new High Efficiency Pixel (HEP) Texas Instruments DLP801RE Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) as a reconfigurable spatial light modulator. This design enables real-time, dynamic configuration of the field of view for targeted spectroscopy of magnetically active regions and full-disk observations. Optical efficiency was validated through simulations and laser testing. Destructive window removal allowed for detailed structural analysis, confirming the elimination of central vias present in previous models. We measured a contrast ratio of 250:1, currently limited by the evaluation board's duty cycle rather than the DMD itself. Furthermore, we successfully simulated artificial planetary transits, recovering depths ranging from gas giants to a 40 ppm rocky planet transit. These results demonstrate the HEP DMD's potential for high-precision solar and exoplanetary science applications.</description>

      <title>Close-in compact super-Earth systems emerging from resonant chains: slow destabilization by unseen remnants of formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.</description>

      <title>Sequential Fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) After Its Near-Sun Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33 au on 2025 October 8. Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment I in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. Given the comet's close perihelion passage, rotational instability driven by enhanced outgassing torques is a plausible contributor to nucleus disintegration and dust release, and may represent the primary source of the observed brightening. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption, when thermal adjustment, dust mantle re-formation, and outgassing-driven torques jointly govern the onset of activity.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ 2.0: Vetting TESS Full-Frame Image Transit Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. This study investigates how well data-driven fully kinetic simulations can reproduce the ion and electron energy distributions observed during a reconnection event by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations initialized with plasma parameters derived from the MMS event and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. Key numerical and physical parameters were systematically varied to assess their influence on the resulting particle spectra. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of nonthermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a more pronounced role in reproducing the observed distributions.We present a novel analysis of data-driven fully kinetic simulations of MR, showing that key aspects of particle acceleration can be captured, while also highlighting the limitations of 2D simulations and the need for more realistic (e.g., 3D) setups to reproduce the observed particle energization accurately.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>
