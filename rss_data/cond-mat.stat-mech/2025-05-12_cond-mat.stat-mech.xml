      <title>Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection with single-site measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the long-time dynamics of an observable associated with a single lattice site is sufficient to determine whether a many-body quantum system exhibits level statistics characteristic of random matrix theory, a widely used diagnostic of quantum chaos. In particular, we focus on the partial survival probability and spin autocorrelation function at a single site, both evolved under a disordered spin-1/2 chain, which is a setup realizable in current experimental platforms. Given the precision and timescales currently achievable, our results indicate that the detection of many-body quantum chaos is feasible, but constrained to small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Trends in Gibbs States for Thermodynamics of Canonical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we consider canonical average for classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically, substitutional alloys) as a map phi from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to that of microscopic configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, phi generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. The nonlinearity has recently been amply studied in terms of configurational geometry, measured by vector field and Kullback-Leibler divergence, whose individual concepts are further unified through stochastic thermodynamic transformation: We call this procedure as Themodynamics of canonical nonlinearity (TCN). Although TCN can reveal the non-linear character across multiple configurations through thermodynamic functions, the essential role for Gibbs states (GBS) in terms of the nonlinearity is still totally unclear. We here tackle this problem, and reveal the characteristic roles of the GBS: (i) Concrete expression of the GBS is derived, (ii) strong correlation between GBSs and averaged nonlinearity over configurations for moled systems is found, and (iii) GBS-based bounds for averaged nonlinearity at specific conditions is derived.</description>

      <title>Criticality and Universality of Generalized Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore synchronization transitions in even-$D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto oscillators on both complete graphs and $d$-dimensional lattices. In the globally coupled system, analytical expansions of the self-consistency equations, incorporating finite-size corrections, reveal universal critical exponents $\beta = 1/2$ and $\bar{\nu} = 5/2$ for all even $D$, indicating an unconventional upper critical dimension $d_u = 5$. Extensive numerical simulations across multiple $D$ confirm these theoretical predictions. For locally coupled systems, we develop a framework based on spin-wave theory and fluctuation-resolved functional network diagnostics, which captures criticality in entrainment transition. A modified Edwards-Anderson order parameter further validates the predicted exponents. This combined theoretical and numerical study uncovers a family of universality classes characterized by $D$-independent but $d$-dependent criticality, offering a unified perspective on symmetry and dimensionality in nonequilibrium synchronization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel algorithms for free-energy calculation of millions of water molecules in the fluid phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating water droplets made up of millions of molecules and on timescales as needed in biological and technological applications is challenging due to the difficulty of balancing accuracy with computational capabilities. Most detailed descriptions, such as ab initio, polarizable, or rigid models, are typically constrained to a few hundred (for ab initio) or thousands of molecules (for rigid models). Recent machine learning approaches allow for the simulation of up to 4 million molecules with ab initio accuracy but only for tens of nanoseconds, even if parallelized across hundreds of GPUs. In contrast, coarse-grained models permit simulations on a larger scale but at the expense of accuracy or transferability. Here, we consider the CVF molecular model of fluid water, which bridges the gap between accuracy and efficiency for free-energy and thermodynamic quantities due to i) a detailed calculation of the hydrogen bond contributions at the molecular level, including cooperative effects, and ii) coarse-graining of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecules. The CVF model can reproduce the experimental equation of state and fluctuations of fluid water across a temperature range of 60 degrees around ambient temperature and from 0 to 50 MPa. In this work, we describe efficient parallel Monte Carlo algorithms executed on GPUs using CUDA, tailored explicitly for the CVF model. We benchmark accessible sizes of 17 million molecules with the Metropolis and 2 million with the Swendsen-Wang Monte Carlo algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Adiabatic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the validity of a potential extension of the adiabatic theorem to quantum quenches, i.e., non-adiabatic changes. In particular, the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) and the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model are studied. The proposed extension of the adiabatic theorem is stated as follows: Consider the overlap between the initial ground state and the post-quench Hamiltonian eigenstates for quenches within the same phase. This overlap is largest for the post-quench ground state. In the case of the TFIM, this conjecture is confirmed for both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases numerically and analytically. In the ANNNI model, the conjecture could be analytically proven for a special case. Numerical methods were employed to investigate the conjecture's validity beyond this special case.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and Page curves in random permutation circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged R\'enyi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering novel order parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of novel alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these observables, including a magnetization-like observable derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results provide a thermodynamic basis for ML's success in reduced representations. This work bridges data-driven ML approaches with fundamental statistical mechanics, showing that criticality in Potts systems can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, and opens avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</description>

      <title>Counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting variables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic theory of polarization under internal and directing electric fields: Fixed-charge and fixed-potential conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a continuum theory on statics and dynamics of polar fluids, where the orientational polarization ${\bi p}_1$ and the induced polarization ${\bi p}_2$ are governed by
  the Onsager directing field ${\bi E}_d$ and the Lorentz internal field $\bi F$, respectively. We start with a dielectric free energy functional $\cal F$ with a cross term $\propto \int\hspace{-0.5mm} d{\bi r}~{\bi p}_1\cdot{\bi p}_2$, which was proposed by
  Felderhof $[$J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. {\bf 12}, 2423 (1979)$]$. With this cross-coupling, our theory can
  yield the theoretical results by Onsager and Kirkwood.
  We also present dynamic equations
  using the functional derivatives $\delta {\cal F}/\delta {\bi p}_i$ to calculate the space-time correlations of ${\bi p}_i$. We then obtain analytic expressions for
  various frequency-dependent quantities including the Debye formula. We find that the fluctuations of the total polarization drastically depend on whether we fix the electrode charge or the applied potential difference between parallel metal electrodes.
  In the latter fixed-potential condition, we obtain a nonlocal (long-range) polarization correlation
  inversely proportional to the cell volume $V$, which
  is crucial to understand the dielectric response. It is produced by nonlocal charge fluctuations on the electrode surfaces and
  is sensitive to the potential drops in the Stern layers in small systems. These nonlocal correlations in the bulk and on the surfaces are closely related due to the global constraint of fixed potential difference. We also add some results in other boundary conditions including the periodic one, where nonlocal correlations also appear.</description>

      <title>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>

      <title>Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</description>

      <title>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</description>

      <title>Guerra interpolation for inverse freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these short notes, we adapt and systematically apply Guerra's interpolation techniques on a class of disordered mean-field spin glasses equipped with crystal fields and multi-value spin variables. These models undergo the phenomenon of inverse melting or inverse freezing. In particular, we focus on the Ghatak-Sherrington model, its extension provided by Katayama and Horiguchi, and the disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Capel model in the mean-field limit, deepened by Crisanti and Leuzzi and by Schupper and Shnerb. Once shown how all these models can be retrieved as particular limits of a unique broader Hamiltonian, we study their free energies. We provide explicit expressions of their annealed and quenched expectations, inspecting the cases of replica symmetry and (first-step) broken replica symmetry. We recover several results previously obtained via heuristic approaches (mainly the replica trick) to prove full agreement with the existing literature. As a sideline, we also inspect the onset of replica symmetry breaking by providing analytically the expression of the de Almeida-Thouless instability line for a replica symmetric description: in this general setting, the latter is new also from a physical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, a variety of ensembles have been devised, including not only the Gibbs ensembles, such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, but also various generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. We show that selecting an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.00039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class, in the presence of a bidimensional surface. By means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where leading bulk scaling corrections are suppressed, we prove the existence of a special phase transition, with unusual exponents, and of an extraordinary phase with logarithmically decaying correlations. These findings contrast with na\"ive arguments on the bulk-surface phase diagram, and allow us to explain some recent puzzling results on the boundary critical behavior of quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs of Symmetric Local Random Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit asymptotically forming a t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:2408.13472, we have established the method of characterizing the maximal order of asymptotic unitary designs generated by symmetric local random circuits, and have explicitly specified the order in the cases of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries. Here, we provide full details on the derivation of the main theorems for general symmetry and for concrete symmetries. Furthermore, we consider a general framework where we have access to a finite set of connected compact unitary subgroups, which includes symmetric local unitary gate sets.</description>

      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</description>
