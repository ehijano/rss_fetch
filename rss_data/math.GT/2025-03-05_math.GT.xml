      <title>Divides with cusps, shadows, and transvergent diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A link in $S^{3}$ is called a symmetric link if there is an orientation preserving involution of $S^{3}$ with a non-empty fixed point set that preserves the link. Any symmetric link can be depicted by a diagram with a symmetry axis lying on the plane of the diagram, called a transvergent diagram. Recently, Sugawara proved that any symmetric link can be represented by a divide with cusps, which is a generalization of A'Campo's divide that allows a finite number of cusps. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of A'Campo's divide in terms of Turaev's shadow, called a divide with gleams. By using divides with gleams, we provide an algorithm to obtain a divide with cusps that represents a symmetric link from its given transvergent diagram. Conversely, we also provide an algorithm to draw a transvergent diagram of the link of a given divide with cusps. Furthermore, we characterize freely $2$-periodic links through divides with gleams on a $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov surfaces and Dynamics in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine which closed orientable $3$-manifolds $M$ admit a self-homeomorphism restricting to a pseudo-Anosov map on an incompressible subsurface $\Sigma$, which we call a pseudo-Anosov surface. When $M$ is irreducible, we show that the self-homeomorphism of $M$ is isotopic rel $\Sigma$ to a "partially pseudo-Anosov" homeomorphism, a notion that we will introduce. This is motivated by the corresponding results for Anosov tori in irreducible $3$-manifolds, and the connection to partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, obtained by F. Rodriguez-Hertz, J. Rodriguez-Hertz and R. Ures.</description>

      <title>Iterated satellite operators on the knot concordance group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a winding number zero satellite operator $P$ on the knot concordance group, if the axis of $P$ has nontrivial self-pairing under the Blanchfield form of the pattern, then the image of the iteration $P^n$ generates an infinite rank subgroup for each $n$. Furthermore, the graded quotients of the filtration of the knot concordance group associated with $P$ have infinite rank at all levels. This gives an affirmative answer to a question of Hedden and Pinz\'{o}n-Caicedo in many cases. We also show that under the same hypotheses, $P^n$ is not a homomorphism on the knot concordance group for each $n$. We use amenable $L^2$-signatures to prove these results.</description>

      <title>Complexified tetrahedrons, fundamental groups, and volume conjecture for double twist knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the volume conjecture for double twist knots are proved. The main tool is the complexified tetrahedron and the associated $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ representation of the fundamental group. A complexified tetrahedron is a version of a truncated or a doubly truncated tetrahedron whose edge lengths and the dihedral angles are complexified. The colored Jones polynomial is expressed in terms of the quantum $6j$ symbol, which corresponds to the complexified tetrahedron.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups, fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. In addition, we study $n$-dimensional Generalized Baumslag-Solitar ($\text{GBS}_n$) groups. We first recover a result by Minasyan and Valiunas on the characterization of $C^*$-simplicity for $\text{GBS}_1$ groups and identify new $C^*$-simple $\text{GBS}_n$ groups including the Leary-Minasyan group. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>
