      <title>Low energy excitations in a long prism geometry: computing the lower critical dimension of the Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general method for studying systems that display excitations with arbitrarily low energy in their low-temperature phase. We argue that in a rectangular right prism geometry, with longitudinal size much larger than the transverse size, correlations decay exponentially (at all temperatures) along the longitudinal dimension, but the scaling of the correlation length with the transverse size carries crucial information from which the lower critical dimension can be inferred. The method is applied in the particularly demanding context of Ising spin glasses at zero magnetic field. The lower critical dimension and the multifractal spectrum for the correlation function are computed from large-scale numerical simulations. Several technical novelties (such as the unexpectedly crucial performance of Houdayer's cluster method or the convenience of using open - rather than periodic - boundary conditions) allow us to study three-dimensional prisms with transverse dimensions up to $L=24$ and effectively infinite longitudinal dimensions down to low temperatures. The value that we find for the lower critical dimension turns out to be in agreement with expectations from both the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and the Droplet model for spin glasses. We argue that our novel setting holds promise in clarifying which of the two competing theories more accurately describes three-dimensional spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum states and hierarchical spectral statistics in a Cantor potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral statistics and wave-function properties of a one-dimensional quantum system subject to a Cantor-type fractal potential. By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization in thermal first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Skyrmions on a Racetrack: Impact of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-driven motion of domain walls and skyrmions is central to the operation of non-volatile magnetic memory devices. Racetrack memory requires current densities high enough to generate velocities above 50 m/s, but such conditions also enhance spin-current noise. We develop a theoretical framework based on the stochastic Thiele equation to analyze the effects of equilibrium (thermal) and nonequilibrium (spin-current) fluctuations on skyrmion dynamics. From this approach, we derive diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements that quantify stochastic motion under both noise sources. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin-current noise dominates skyrmion dynamics in typical racetrack structures up to room temperature. We further address the first-passage-time problem, obtaining the mean first-passage time and its standard deviation along and across the racetrack. These results quantify how random displacements affect skyrmion propagation and detection, providing insights into error sources in high-speed racetrack memory devices.</description>

      <title>Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description>

      <title>On the free energy of vector spin glasses with non-convex interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limit free energy of spin-glass models with convex interactions can be represented as a variational problem involving an explicit functional. Models with non-convex interactions are much less well-understood, and simple variational formulas involving the same functional are known to be invalid in general. We show here that a slightly weaker property of the limit free energy does extend to non-convex models. Indeed, under the assumption that the limit free energy exists, we show that this limit can always be represented as a critical value of the said functional. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, we also show that any subsequential limit of the law of the overlap matrix is a critical point of this functional. We believe that these results capture the fundamental conclusions of the non-rigorous replica method.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of the multiscale mean-field spin-glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different time scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature, or weak coupling, region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently strong couplings the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

      <title>Structure factor realizability reveals the glass-dynamics onset temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When liquids are cooled rapidly, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this limitation. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a kink at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a topological change in the realizability landscape of the structure factor, even though the structure factor itself only changes smoothly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>
