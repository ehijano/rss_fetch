      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets.</description>

      <title>Towards Standardized Regulations for Block Chain Smart Contracts: Insights from Delphi and SWARA Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of digital currency and the public ledger Block Chain has led to the development of a new type of electronic contract known as "smart contracts." For these contracts to be considered valid, they must adhere to traditional contract rules and be concluded without any impediments. Once written, encrypted, and signed, smart contracts are recorded in the Block Chain Ledger, providing transparent and secure record-keeping. Smart contracts offer several benefits, including their ability to execute automatically without requiring human intervention, their provision of public visibility of contract provisions on the Block Chain, their avoidance of financial crimes like Money Laundering, and their prevention of contract abuses. However, disputes arising from smart contracts still require human intervention, presenting unique challenges in enforcing these contracts, such as evidentiary issues, enforceability of waivers of defenses, and jurisdictional and choice-of-law considerations. Due to the novel nature of smart contracts, there are currently no standardized regulations that apply to them. Countries that have approved them have turned to customary law to legitimize their use. The Delphi method was used to identify critical success factors for applying blockchain transactions in a manufacturing company. Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was then utilized to determine the most influential factors. The proposed methodology was implemented, and results show that the most influential factors for the successful application of blockchain transactions as smart contracts in a manufacturing company are: turnover, the counter argument, vision, components for building, and system outcome quality. Conversely, connections with government entities and subcontractors, and the guarantee of quality have the least influence on successful implementation.</description>

      <title>Blockchains, MEV and the knapsack problem: a primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a close look at a problem labeled maximal extractable value (MEV), which arises in a blockchain due to the ability of a block producer to manipulate the order of transactions within a block. Indeed, blockchains such as Ethereum have spent considerable resources addressing this issue and have redesigned the block production process to account for MEV. This paper provides an overview of the MEV problem and tracks how Ethereum has adapted to its presence. A vital aspect of the block building exercise is that it is a variant of the knapsack problem. Consequently, this paper highlights the role of designing auctions to fill a knapsack--or knapsack auctions--in alleviating the MEV problem. Overall, this paper presents a survey of the main issues and an accessible primer for researchers and students wishing to explore the economics of block building and MEV further.</description>

      <title>Flexible Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity in Event Studies: Application to the Child Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a practical toolkit for analyzing effect heterogeneity in event studies. We develop an estimation algorithm and adapt existing econometric results to provide its theoretical justification. We apply these tools to Dutch administrative data to study individual heterogeneity in the child-penalty (CP) context in three ways. First, we document significant heterogeneity in the individual-level CP trajectories, emphasizing the importance of going beyond the average CP. Second, we use individual-level estimates to examine the impact of childcare supply expansion policies. Our approach uncovers nonlinear treatment effects, challenging the conventional policy evaluation methods constrained to less flexible specifications. Third, we use the individual-level estimates as a regressor on the right-hand side to study the intergenerational elasticity of the CP between mothers and daughters. After adjusting for the measurement error bias, we find the elasticity of 24\%. Our methodological framework contributes to empirical practice by offering a flexible approach tailored to specific research questions and contexts. We provide an open-source package ('unitdid') to facilitate widespread adoption.</description>
