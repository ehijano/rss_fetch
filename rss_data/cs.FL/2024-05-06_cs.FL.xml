      <title>Using finite automata to compute the base-$b$ representation of the golden ratio and other quadratic irrationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $n$'th digit of the base-$b$ representation of the golden ratio is a finite-state function of the Zeckendorf representation of $b^n$, and hence can be computed by a finite automaton. Similar results can be proven for any quadratic irrational. We use a satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove, in some cases, that the automata we construct are minimal.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Finite Automaton Emptiness is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is undecidable whether the language recognized by a probabilistic finite automaton is empty. Several other undecidability results, in particular regarding problems about matrix products, are based on this important theorem. We present two proofs of this theorem from the literature in a self-contained way, and we derive some strengthenings. For example, we show that the problem remains undecidable for a fixed probabilistic finite automaton with 11 states, where only the starting distribution is given as input.</description>

      <title>The Sparse Tsetlin Machine: Sparse Representation with Active Literals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Sparse Tsetlin Machine (STM), a novel Tsetlin Machine (TM) that processes sparse data efficiently. Traditionally, the TM does not consider data characteristics such as sparsity, commonly seen in NLP applications and other bag-of-word-based representations. Consequently, a TM must initialize, store, and process a significant number of zero values, resulting in excessive memory usage and computational time. Previous attempts at creating a sparse TM have predominantly been unsuccessful, primarily due to their inability to identify which literals are sufficient for TM training. By introducing Active Literals (AL), the STM can focus exclusively on literals that actively contribute to the current data representation, significantly decreasing memory footprint and computational time while demonstrating competitive classification performance.</description>

      <title>A Session Type System for Asynchronous Unreliable Broadcast Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.01353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Session types are formal specifications of communication protocols, allowing protocol implementations to be verified by typechecking. Up to now, session type disciplines have assumed that the communication medium is reliable, with no loss of messages. However, unreliable broadcast communication is common in a wide class of distributed systems such as ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Often such systems have structured communication patterns that should be amenable to analysis by means of session types, but the necessary theory has not previously been developed. We introduce the Unreliable Broadcast Session Calculus, a process calculus with unreliable broadcast communication, and equip it with a session type system that we show is sound. We capture two common operations, broadcast and gather, inhabiting dual session types. Message loss may lead to non-synchronised session endpoints. To further account for unreliability we provide with an autonomous recovery mechanism that does not require acknowledgements from session participants. Our type system ensures soundness, safety, and progress between the synchronised endpoints within a session. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an unreliable, asynchronous network.</description>
