      <title>Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Quasilinear Systems with Asymptotically Unpredictable Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel type of trajectory on semiflows, called asymptotically unpredictable, was proposed by Fen and Tokmak Fen [15]. The presence of sensitivity, which is an indispensable feature of chaotic dynamics, is a crucial property that arises from such trajectories. In the present paper, we show the existence and uniqueness of asymptotically unpredictable solutions for quasilinear systems with delay making benefit of the contraction mapping principle. Additionally, we introduce the notion of an asymptotically unpredictable sequence. It is verified that there exist asymptotically unpredictable sequences which are not unpredictable. Discrete-time equations possessing asymptotically unpredictable orbits are also under investigation. Examples of continuous-time and discrete-time systems with asymptotically unpredictable solutions are provided.</description>

      <title>A generation theorem for the perturbation of strongly continuous semigroups by unbounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness of the evolution equation of the form $u'(t)=Au(t)+Cu(t)$, $t\ge 0$, where $A$ is the generator of a $C_0$- semigroup and $C$ is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$. We prove that if $A$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_A(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ with $\|T(t)\| \le Me^{\omega t}$ in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ and $C$ is a linear operator in $\mathbb{X}$ such that $D(A)\subset D(C)$ and $\| CR(\mu ,A)\| \le K/(\mu -\omega)$ for each $\mu&gt;\omega$, then, the above-mentioned evolution equation is well-posed, that is, $A+C$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_{A+C}(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\| T_{A+C}(t)\| \le Me^{(\omega +MK)t}$. Our approach is to use the Hille-Yosida Theorem. Discussions on the persistence of asymptotic behavior of the perturbed equations such as the roughness of exponential dichotomy are also given. The obtained results seem to be new.</description>

      <title>A Study of Quantitative Correlations Between Crucial Bio-markers and the Optimal Drug Regimen of Type-I Lepra Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leprosy (Hansen's) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This disease slowly leads to occurrence of leprae reactions which mainly damage peripheral nervous system which cause loss of organs. We can prevent occurring leprae reactions by monitoring the bio-markers involved in it. Motivated by these observations in this research work we do a exhaustive study dealing with the quantitative correlations between crucial bio-markers and the Multi Drug Thearphy (MDT) used in treating the type I lepra reaction. We frame and study a complex 11 compartment model dealing with the the concentrations of plasma $c_1(t)$ and effective drug action $c_2(t)$, susceptible schwann cells $S(t)$, infected schwann cells $I(t)$, bacterial load $B(t)$, and five cytokines pivotal in Type-1 Lepra reaction: IFN-$\gamma$, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-$10$, IL-$12$, IL-$15$, and IL-$17$. We explore exhaustively and establish the quantitative correlations with respect to the optimal drug dosage of the MDT drugs such as rifampin, clofazimine \&amp; dapsone and the crucial bio-markers involved in type I lepra reaction. We conclude this work by reitrating the fact that the optimal drug dosage of the MDT drugs found through these optimal control studies and the dosage prescribed as per WHO guidelines are almost the same.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for distributed time delay identification based on a mixed Erlang kernel approximation and the linear chain trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry and nature, and they significantly affect both transient dynamics and stability properties. Consequently, it is often necessary to identify and account for the delays when, e.g., designing a model-based control strategy. However, identifying delays in differential equations is not straightforward and requires specialized methods. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for identifying distributed delays in delay differential equations (DDEs) that only involves simulation of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we 1) approximate the kernel in the DDEs (also called the memory function) by the probability density function of a mixed Erlang distribution and 2) use the linear chain trick (LCT) to transform the resulting DDEs into ODEs. Finally, the parameters in the kernel approximation are estimated as the solution to a dynamical least-squares problem, and we use a single-shooting approach to approximate this solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm using numerical examples that involve the logistic equation and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing for compact group extensions of hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give explicit conditions for compact group extensions of hyperbolic flows (including geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds) to exhibit quantifiable rates of mixing (or decay of correlations) with respect to the natural probability measures, which are locally the product of a Gibbs measure for a H\"older potential and the Haar measure. More precisely, we show that the mixing rate with respect to H\"older functions will be faster than any given polynomial (i.e., rapid mixing). We also give error estimates on the equidistribution of the holonomy around closed orbits. In particular, these results apply to some frame flows for manifolds with negative sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Patterns and Chaos Control in Discrete-Time Coral Reef Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction in coral reef densities, characterized by the proliferation of macroalgae, has emerged as a global threat. In this paper, we present a discrete-time coral reef dynamical model that incorporates macroalgae. We explore all ecologically possible equilibrium points for the proposed model. The conditions for the local stability of the interior equilibrium point are analyzed, which represents the coexistence of both coral and macroalgae. Furthermore, we investigate the model's behavior using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Our analysis reveals that the model undergoes codimension-one bifurcations, specifically period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. To address the chaos resulting from the emergence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, we apply the OGY feedback control method and a hybrid control methodology. Finally, we provide numerical simulations not only to validate the obtained results but also to demonstrate the complex dynamic behaviors that arise. These behaviors include reversal period-doubling bifurcation, period-4, 8, and 24 bubble bifurcations, as well as chaotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of the problem of a "rubber" ellipsoid of revolution rolling on a plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of an ellipsoid of revolution rolling on a horizontal plane under the assumption that there is no slipping at the point of contact and no spinning about the vertical. A reduction of the equations of motion to a fixed level set of first integrals is performed. Permanent rotations corresponding to the rolling of an ellipsoid in a circle or in a straight line are found. A linear stability analysis of permanent rotations is carried out. A complete classification of possible trajectories of the reduced system is performed using a bifurcation analysis. A classification of the trajectories of the center of mass of the ellipsoid depending on parameter values and initial conditions is performed.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of the Singularly-Perturbed van der Pol Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman principle eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the singularl-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of skew-products over typical IETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove ergodicity of a class of infinite measure preserving systems, called skew-products. More precisely, we consider systems of the form
\[
\operatorname{T_f}{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}}{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}}{(x, t)}{(T(x), t+f(x))},
\]
where $T$ is an interval exchange transformation and $f$ is a piece-wise constant function with a finite number of discontinuities. We show that such system is ergodic with respect to $\operatorname{Leb}_{[0,1)\times \mathbb{R}}$ for a typical choice of parameters of $T$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>A note on the topological synchronisation of unimodal maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we complete the analysis carried on in [CGSV] about the topological synchronisation of unimodal maps of the interval coupled in a master-slave configuration, by answering to the questions raised in that paper. Namely, we compute the weak limits of the invariant measure of the coupled system as the coupling strength $k \in (0,1)$ tends to $0$ and to $1$ and discuss the uniqueness of the invariant measure of its random dynamical system counterpart.

      <title>Validated error bounds for pseudospectral approximation of delay differential equations: unstable manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudospectral approximation provides a means to approximate the dynamics of delay differential equations (DDE) by ordinary differential equations (ODE). This article develops a computer-aided algorithm to determine the distance between the unstable manifold of a DDE and the unstable manifold of the approximating pseudospectral ODE. The algorithm is based upon the parametrization method. While a-priori the parametrization method for a vector-valued ODE involves computing a sequence of vector-valued Taylor coefficients, we show that for the pseudospectral ODE, due to its specific structure, the problem reduces to finding a sequence of scalars, which significantly simplifies the problem.</description>

      <title>Feedback-delay dependence of the stability of cluster periodic orbits in populations of degrade-and-fire oscillators with common activator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback delay has been identified as a key ingredient in the quorum sensing synchronization of synthetic gene oscillators. While this influence has been evidenced at the theoretical level in a simplified system of degrade-and-fire oscillators coupled via a common activator protein, full mathematical certifications remained to be provided. Here, we prove from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint that, for the very same model, the synchronized degrade-and-fire oscillations are 1/ unstable with respect to out-of-sync perturbations in absence of delay, and 2/ are otherwise asymptotically stable in presence of delay, no matter how small is its amplitude. To that goal, we proceed to an extensive study of the population dynamics in this system, which in particular identifies the mechanisms of, and related criteria for, the delay-dependent stability of periodic orbits with respect to out-of-sync perturbations. As an additional outcome, the analysis also reveals that, depending on the parameters, multiple stable partially synchronized periodic orbits can coexist with the fully synchronized one.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Classification of Generalized Pseudo-Anosov Homeomorphisms via Geometric Markov Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis provides a classification of generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms up to topological conjugacy using an algorithmic approach. A Markov partition of a generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is a decomposition of the surface into a finite number of rectangles with disjoint interiors, such that their images intersect with any other rectangle in the Markov partition along a finite number of horizontal sub-rectangles. Every generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism has a Markov partition, and, by using the surface's orientation, we can endow any Markov partition with a geometrization. The geometric type of a geometric Markov partition was defined by Bonatti and Langevin in their book, "Diffeomorphismes de Smale des surfaces", to classify saddle-type basic pieces for structurally stable diffeomorphisms on surfaces. A geometric type is an abstract combinatorial object that generalizes the incidence matrix of a Markov partition. It takes into account not only the number of times the image of a rectangle intersects with any other rectangle in the family but also the order and change of orientation induced by the homeomorphisms. This thesis employs the geometric type of a geometric Markov partition to classify conjugacy classes of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. The classification is provided by the three main results in this manuscript: I) The geometric type is a complete invariant of conjugation. II) A criterion is provided for determining whether an abstract geometric type is realized by a geometric Markov partition of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. III) An algorithm is described for determining whether two geometric types in the pseudo-Anosov class are realized by generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms that are topologically conjugated or not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a nonlocal reaction-diffusion-advection model that describes the spatial dynamics of freshwater organisms in a river with a directional motion. Our goal is to investigate how the advection rate affects the dynamic behaviors of species. We first establish the well-posedness of global solutions, where the regularized problem containing a viscosity term and the re-established maximum principle play an important role. And we then show the existence/nonexistence, uniqueness, and stability of nontrivial stationary solutions by analyzing the principal eigenvalue of integro-differential operator (especially studying the monotonicity of the principal eigenvalue with respect to the advection rate), which enables us to understand the longtime behaviors of solutions and obtain the sharp criteria for persistence or extinction. Furthermore, we study the limiting behaviors of solutions with respect to the advection rate and find that the sufficiently large directional motion will cause species extinction in all situations. Lastly, the numerical simulations verify our theoretical proofs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic functional partial differential equations with monotone coefficients: Poisson stability measures, exponential mixing and limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Poisson stable (including stationary, periodic, almost periodic, Levitan almost periodic, Bohr almost automorphic, pseudo-periodic, Birkhoff recurrent, pseudo-recurrent, etc.) measures and limit theorems for stochastic functional partial differential equations(SFPDEs) with monotone coefficients. We first show the existence and uniqueness of entrance measure $\mu _{t}$ for SFPDEs by dissipative method (or remoting start). Then, with the help of Shcherbakov's comparability method in character of recurrence, we prove that the entrance measure inherits the same recurrence of coefficients. Thirdly, we show the tightness of the set of measures $\mu _{t}$. As a result, any sequence of the average of $\{\mu _{t}\}_{t\in\mathbb{R} }$ have the limit point $\mu ^{*}$. Further, we study the uniform exponential mixing of the measure $\mu ^{*}$ in the sense of Wasserstein metric. Fourthly, under uniform exponential mixing and Markov property, we establish the strong law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and estimate the corresponding rates of convergence for solution maps of SFPDEs. Finally, we give applications of stochastic generalized porous media equations with delay to illustrate of our results.</description>

      <title>Method of Successive Approximations for Stochastic Optimal Control: Contractivity and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) is a fixed-point iterative method used to solve stochastic optimal control problems. It is an indirect method based on the conditions derived from the Stochastic Maximum Principle (SMP), an extension of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to stochastic control problems. In this study, we investigate the contractivity and the convergence of MSA for a specific and interesting class of stochastic dynamical systems (when the drift coefficient is one-sided-Lipschitz with a negative constant and the diffusion coefficient is Lipschitz continuous). Our analysis unfolds in three key steps: firstly, we prove the stability of the state process with respect to the control process. Secondly, we establish the stability of the adjoint process. Finally, we present rigorous evidence to prove the contractivity and then the convergence of MSA. This study contributes to enhancing the understanding of MSA's applicability and effectiveness in addressing stochastic optimal control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent demonstration of drastically different turbulent flow dynamics of an EVP fluid by Abdelgawad et al. (Nat. Phys., 2023, 1-5.), we analyse the linear stability of the sliding Couette flow of an EVP fluid. After yielding, the EVP fluid behaves as an Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. In the creeping-flow limit, in the absence of yield stress, two discrete linearly stable Gorodtsov and Leonov (GL) modes exist for an arbitrarily high value of the Weissenberg number. As yield stress effects, i.e., Bingham number increases, the GL modes become unstable, leading to the novel instability. Analysis reveals that these modes originate near the boundaries due to the `extra normal stress' arising from the interplay between yield stress and elasticity. The extra normal stress is an inherent feature of an EVP fluid. Thus, the predicted novel instability is expected to be present in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>A complete pair of solvents of a quadratic matrix pencil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ and $C$ be square complex matrices. The differential equation \begin{equation*} x''(t)+Bx'(t)+Cx(t)=f(t) \end{equation*} is considered. A solvent is a matrix solution $X$ of the equation $X^2+BX+C=\mathbf0$. A pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ is called complete if the matrix $X-Z$ is invertible. Knowing a complete pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ allows us to reduce the solution of the initial value problem to the calculation of two matrix exponentials $e^{Xt}$ and $e^{Zt}$. The problem of finding a complete pair $X$ and $Z$, which leads to small rounding errors in solving the differential equation, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with an N-dimensional Langevin Equation and a Neural-Ordinary Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity day-ahead prices is essential in competitive electricity markets. Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naive methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the synchronization problems for general high-dimensional linear networks over finite fields. By using the technique of linear transformations and invariant subspaces for linear spaces over finite fields, several necessary and sufficient conditions for the synchronization of high-dimensional linear networks over finite fields are proposed. This paper not only generalizes the existing results from 1-dimensional to high-dimensional linear networks but also adopts a new approach. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Anderson localization for Schr\"odinger operators with even analytic potentials on the first supercritical stratum for Liouville frequencies in the sharp regime $\{E: L(\omega,E)&gt;\beta(\omega)&gt;0, \kappa(\omega,E)=1\}$, with $\kappa(\omega,E)$ being Avila's acceleration. This paper builds on the large deviation measure estimate and complexity bound scheme, originally developed for Diophantine frequencies by Bourgain, Goldstein and Schlag \cites{BG,BGS1,BGS2}, and the improved complexity bounds in \cite{HS1}. Additionally, it strengthens the large deviation estimates for weak Liouville frequencies in \cite{HZ}. We also introduce new ideas to handle Liouville frequencies in a sharp way.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of Bedford-McMullen carpets with applications to Lipschitz equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate dimensions were recently introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions $\dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet $\Lambda$ for the whole spectrum of $\theta \in [0,1]$, in terms of a certain large deviations rate function. The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly increasing in $\theta$, and the function $\theta\mapsto \dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ exhibits interesting features not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many phase transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave.
  We make an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis by showing that two carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the Hausdorff multifractal spectra of the uniform Bernoulli measures on the two carpets are equal. Since intermediate dimensions are bi-Lipschitz invariant, this shows that the equality of these multifractal spectra is a necessary condition for two such carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Lorenz equations, a system of three dimensional ordinary differential equations modeling atmospheric convection. These equations are chaotic and hard to study even numerically, and so a simpler "geometric model" has been introduced in the seventies. One of the classical problems in dynamical systems is to relate the original equations to the geometric model. This has been achieved numerically by Tucker for the classical parameter values, and remains open for general values. In this paper we establish analytically a relation to the geometric model, for a different set of parameter values that we prove must exist. This is facilitated by finding a novel way to apply topological tools developed for the study of surface dynamics to the more intricate case of three dimensional flows.</description>

Abstract: We consider Abelian covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces. We establish an asymptotic expansion of the correlations for the horocycle flow on $\mathbb{Z}^d$-covers, thus proving a strong form of Krickeberg mixing. We also prove that the spectral measures around $0$ of the Casimir operators on any increasing sequence of finite Abelian covers converge weakly to an absolutely continuous measure.</description>

      <title>Minimal and proximal examples of $\bar{d}$-stable and $\bar{d}$-approachable shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study shift spaces over a finite alphabet that can be approximated by mixing shifts of finite type in the sense of (pseudo)metrics connected to Ornstein's $\bar{d}$ metric ($\bar{d}$-approachable shift spaces). The class of $\bar{d}$-approachable shifts can be considered as a topological analog of measure-theoretical Bernoulli systems. The notion of $\bar{d}$-approachability together with a closely connected notion of $\bar{d}$-shadowing were introduced by Konieczny, Kupsa, and Kwietniak [in \emph{Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems}, vol. \textbf{43} (2023), issue 3, pp. 943--970]. These notions were developed with the aim to significantly generalize specification properties. Indeed, many popular variants of the specification property, including the classic one and almost/weak specification property ensure $\bar{d}$-approachability and $\bar{d}$-shadowing. Here, we study further properties and connections between $\bar{d}$-shadowing and $\bar{d}$-approachability. We prove that $\bar{d}$-shadowing implies $\bar{d}$-stability (a notion recently introduced by Tim Austin). We show that for surjective shift spaces with the $\bar{d}$-shadowing property the Hausdorff pseudodistance $\bar{d}^H$ between shift spaces induced by $\bar{d}$ is the same as the Hausdorff distance between their simiplices of invariant measures with respect to the Hausdorff distance induced by the Ornstein's metric $\bar{d}$ between measures. We prove that without $\bar{d}$-shadowing this need not to be true (it is known that the former distance always bounds the latter). We provide examples illustrating these results including minimal examples and proximal examples of shift spaces with the $\bar{d}$-shadowing property. The existence of such shift spaces was announced in our earlier paper [op. cit.]. It shows that $\bar{d}$-shadowing indeed generalises the specification property.</description>

      <title>The topological structure of isolated points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding provided recently some synthetic results about generic $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts, which rely mainly on an original theorem stating that isolated points form a residual set in the space of $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts such that all other residual set must contain it. As a direction for further research, they pointed towards genericity in the space of $\mathbb{G}$-shifts, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finitely generated group. In the present text, we approach this for the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, where $d \ge 2$. As it is usual, multidimensional dynamical systems are much more difficult to understand. Provided the result of R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding, it is natural to begin with a better understanding of isolated points. We prove here a characterization of such points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, in terms of the natural notion of maximal subsystems which we also introduce in this article. From this characterization we recover the one of R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding's. We also prove a series of results which exploit this notion. In particular some transitivity-like properties can be related to the number of maximal subsystems. Furthermore, on the contrary of dimension one, the set of isolated shifts is not residual. We also prove that the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts is infinite when $d &gt; 1$, while it is equal to one when $d=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arguments inspired by algorithmic information theory predict an inverse relation between the probability and complexity of output patterns in a wide range of input-output maps. This phenomenon is known as \emph{simplicity bias}. By viewing the parameters of dynamical systems as inputs, and resulting (digitised) trajectories as outputs, we study simplicity bias in the logistic map, Gauss map, sine map, Bernoulli map, and tent map. We find that the logistic map, Gauss map, and sine map all exhibit simplicity bias upon sampling of map initial values and parameter values, but the Bernoulli map and tent map do not. The simplicity bias upper bound on output pattern probability is used to make \emph{a priori} predictions for the probability of output patterns. In some cases, the predictions are surprisingly accurate, given that almost no details of the underlying dynamical systems are assumed. More generally, we argue that studying probability-complexity relationships may be a useful tool in studying patterns in dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between Turing completeness and topological entropy of dynamical systems. We first prove that a natural class of Turing machines that we call "regular Turing machines" (which includes most of the examples of universal Turing machines) has positive topological entropy. We deduce that any Turing complete dynamics with a continuous encoding that simulates a universal machine in this class is chaotic. This applies to our previous constructions of Turing complete area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the disk and 3D stationary Euler flows. The article concludes with an appendix written by Ville Salo that introduces a method to construct universal Turing machines that are not regular and have zero topological entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of birational maps of smooth affine quadric 3-folds, {over the complex numbers}, of the form $x_1x_4-x_2x_3=$ constant, which seems to have some (among many others) interesting/unexpected characters: a) they are cohomologically hyperbolic, b) their second dynamical degree is an algebraic number but not an algebraic integer, and c) the logarithmic growth of their periodic points is strictly smaller than their algebraic entropy. These maps are restrictions of a polynomial map on $\mathbb{C}^4$ preserving each of the quadrics. The study in this paper is a mixture of rigorous and experimental ones, where for the experimental study we rely on Bertini which is a reliable and fast software for expensive numerical calculations in complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid system is a system whose dynamics is given by a mixture of both continuous and discrete transitions. In particular, these systems can be utilised to describe the dynamics of a mechanical system with impacts. Based on the approach by Clark, we develop a geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory for forced and nonholonomic hybrid dynamical systems. We state the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equations for these classes of systems and apply our results to analyze some examples.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approximation for the finite-size Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a stochastic model reduction of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for finitely many coupled phase oscillators with phase frustration. Whereas in the thermodynamic limit coupled oscillators exhibit stationary states and a constant order parameter, finite-size networks exhibit persistent temporal fluctuations of the order parameter. These fluctuations are caused by the interaction of the synchronized oscillators with the non-entrained oscillators. We present numerical results suggesting that the collective effect of the non-entrained oscillators on the synchronized cluster can be approximated by a Gaussian process. This allows for an effective closed evolution equation for the synchronized oscillators driven by a Gaussian process which we approximate by a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our reduction reproduces the stochastic fluctuations of the order parameter and leads to a simple stochastic differential equation for the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of the contactomorphism group of finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given coorientable contact manifold $(M^{2n+1},\xi)$, we consider the group $ \operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ consisting of $C^{r,\delta}$ contactomorphisms with compact support which is equipped with $C^{r,\delta}$-topology of H\"older regularity $(r,\delta)$ for $r \geq 1$ and $0 &lt;\delta \leq 1$. We prove that for all H\"older class exponents with $r &gt; n + 2$ or $r = n+1, \, \frac12 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ (resp. $r &lt; n+1$ or $r = n+1$ and $ 0&lt; \delta &lt;\frac12$), the group is a perfect (and so a simple) group. In particular, $\operatorname{Cont}_c^r(M,\xi)$ is simple for all integer $r \geq 1$. For the case of $\operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ of general H\"older regularity, we prove the simplicity for all pairs $(r,\delta)$ leaving only the case of $(r,\delta) = (n+1,\frac12)$ open.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz rigidity of discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a bi-Lipschitz rigidity theorem for a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group. As an application, we show that any Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple algebraic group $G$ cannot have a $C^1$-smooth slim limit set in $G/P$ for any non-maximal parabolic subgroup $P$.</description>
