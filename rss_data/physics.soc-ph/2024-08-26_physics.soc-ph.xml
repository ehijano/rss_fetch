      <title>The impact of social media on polarization in the society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of social media platforms has revolutionized information consumption patterns, with individuals frequently engaging in these platforms for social interactions. This trend has fostered an environment where people gravitate towards information that aligns with their preconceived notions, leading to the formation of echo chambers and polarization within the society. Recently introduced activity-driven models have been successful in capturing the dynamics of information propagation and polarization. The present study uses this model to explore the impact of social media on a polarized society. By considering the varying influence of media, ranging from exposing individuals to contradictory views to reinforcing existing opinions, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed, triggering a transition from consensus to polarization. The transition points from polarization to consensus are derived analytically and is validated through numerical simulations. This research sheds light on the complex interplay between social media dynamics and societal polarization.</description>

      <title>Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. Some recent analyses support either view, and we lack a comparative test on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous, computational comparison of the main theories against 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of some simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony poorly predicts scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints arising from limitations on human memory in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. This provides strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and proposes that preference for intermediate melodic complexity is a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>From Mobilisation to Radicalisation: Probing the Persistence and Radicalisation of Social Movements Using an Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are living in an age of protest. Although we have an excellent understanding of the factors that predict participation in protest, we understand little about the conditions that foster a sustained (versus transient) movement. How do interactions between supporters and authorities combine to influence whether and how people engage (i.e., using conventional or radical tactics)? This paper introduces a novel, theoretically-founded and empirically-informed agent-based model (DIMESim) to address these questions. We model the complex interactions between the psychological attributes of the protester (agents), the authority to whom the protests are targeted, and the environment that allows protesters to coordinate with each other -- over time, and at a population scale. Where an authority is responsive and failure is contested, a modest sized conventional movement endured. Where authorities repeatedly and incontrovertibly fail the movement, the population disengaged from action but evidenced an ongoing commitment to radicalism (latent radicalism).</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics on signed graphs and graphons: Beyond the piece-wise constant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <title>Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science and Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amidst an evolving landscape of questions, opportunities, and challenges. This paper introduces a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing research when producing new works. We apply this framework to millions of scientific publications and patents and uncover a pervasive "pivot penalty", where the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their prior work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across scientific publishing and patenting and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. While creativity frameworks suggest a benefit to exploratory search by researchers and often emphasize outsider advantages in driving breakthroughs, we find little evidence for such an advantage. The pivot penalty is consistent with increasingly narrow specializations of researchers, and when researchers undertake large pivots, a signature of their work is weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties. COVID-19 provides a high-scale case study, where many researchers engaged the pandemic, yet the pivot penalty remains severe. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration, and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in adapting to new opportunities and threats. The results have implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy, and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.</description>

      <title>The News Comment Gap and Algorithmic Agenda Setting in Online Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred by readers, known as the "News Gap", is well-documented. However, the difference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is less studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for reader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus important to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these are served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions differently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der Standard to understand the "News Comment Gap" and the effects of different ranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex, direct responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from elite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility Metric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find dramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by sentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists can exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and algorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in fostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic objectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal importance of online discourse.</description>
