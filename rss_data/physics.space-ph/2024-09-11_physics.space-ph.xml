      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Local-Scale Auroral Spiral and Global-Scale Transpolar Arc: Changes of Auroras and Field-Aligned Current Profiles Before a Substorm and After Its Recovery Phase</title>

Abstract: Local vortex-structured auroral spiral and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI), when a substorm almost recovered. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside (oval-aligned TPA), and a chain of multiple auroral spots and spiral were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Contemporaneous appearances of the TPA and the auroral spiral can be seen after the spiral appeared alone. Polar also detected the oval-aligned TPA and another dawnside TPA with the nightside end distorted toward the premidnight sector (J-shaped TPA) before and after the spiral's formation, respectively. To examine these associated magnetotail structures, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, based on two different types of code, BAT-S-RUS and improved REPPU, and examined how the field-aligned current (FAC) profiles varied in association with changes of the auroral form to TPA and/or auroral spiral. Global MHD simulations with the two different types of code can reproduce the TPAs and the associated FAC structures in the magnetotail. The auroral spiral and its nightside FAC profile, however, were not formed in both simulations, suggesting that its formation process cannot be treated within an MHD framework but is closely related to some kinetic process. When the J-shaped TPA and the auroral spiral contemporaneously appeared, the two MHD simulations could not reproduce the TPA, spiral and their associated magnetotail FAC structures, also advocating that a kinetic effect related to the spiral formation might prevent the TPA occurrence.</description>
