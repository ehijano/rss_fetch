      <title>The graphene squeeze-film microphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most microphones operate by detecting the sound-pressure induced motion of a membrane. In contrast, here we introduce a microphone that operates by monitoring the sound-pressure-induced modulation of the compressibility of air. By driving a graphene membrane at its resonance frequency, the gas, that is trapped in a squeeze-film beneath it, is compressed at high frequency. Since the stiffness of the gas film depend on the air pressure, the resonance frequency of the graphene is modulated by variations in sound pressure. We demonstrate that this squeeze-film microphone principle can be used to detect sound and music by tracking the membrane's resonance frequency using a phase-locked loop (PLL). Since the sound detection principle is different from conventional devices, the squeeze-film microphone potentially offers advantages like increased dynamic range, and a lower susceptibility to pressure-induced failure and vibration-induced noise. Moreover, it might be made much smaller, as demonstrated by the microphone in this work that operates using a circular graphene membrane with an area that is more than a factor 1000 smaller than that of MEMS microphones.</description>

      <title>Ultra-bright and energy-efficient quantum-dot LEDs by idealizing charge injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lighting and display, relying on electric and optical down-conversion emission with sluggish power efficiency, account for &gt;15% global electricity consumption1,2. In 2014, quantum-dot (QD) LEDs (QLEDs) with near-optimal external quantum efficiency emerged3 and promised a pathway to avoid the vast down-conversion energy loss4,5. Despite a decade of progress4-22, fabrication of energy-efficient QLEDs with application-relevant brightness remains elusive. Here, the main roadblock is identified as the oxidative species adsorbed in the nanocrystalline electron-injection layer of QLEDs, which is then addressed by a simple reductive treatment to simultaneously boosts electron conductivity and hole blockage of the electron-injection layer. The resulting sub-bandgap-driven QLEDs with optimal efficiency achieve ultra-high brightness across the entire visible spectrum at least 2.6-fold higher than existing benchmarks. The brightness fully satisfies the demands of various forms of lighting and display, which surges to a remarkable level sufficient for QD laser diodes with a moderate bias (~9 V). Optimized electron injection further enables new types of QD-blend LEDs for diffuse white-light sources surpassing the 2035 R&amp;D targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy. Our findings open a door for understanding and optimizing carrier transport in nanocrystalline semiconductors shared by various types of solution-processed optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Fluidic Approach to Corrective Eyewear Manufacturing in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited access to corrective eyewear remains a significant medical, societal, and economic challenge, even in the 21st century. More than 1 billion people suffer from uncorrected vision impairment, with the vast majority residing in developing countries. Decades of philanthropic efforts failed to supply even a small fraction of the demand, whereas local manufacturing using standard machining technologies remains out of reach due to inadequate resources. We here show that the Fluidic Shaping approach can be utilized to create a new manufacturing modality for high-quality ophthalmic lenses that entirely eliminates the need for machining, and instead uses surface tension to shape liquid polymer volumes into prescription lenses. We present a compact device wherein a liquid photopolymer is injected into an elliptical frame submerged within an immersion liquid of equal density, resulting in two liquid surfaces whose minimum-energy states correspond to two lens surfaces. After several minutes of curing, a complete solid lens is obtained, requiring no post-processing. We provide an analytical model and experimental validation, showing that all spherical and cylindrical corrections can be attained by simply controlling the volume of the polymer and the frame's eccentricity. We demonstrate the fabrication of complete eyeglasses that meet and exceed industry standards, relying solely on a 1 gallon water container integrated with an array of low-power LEDs.</description>

      <title>An insertable glucose sensor using a compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are emerging for personalized glucose management owing to their lower cost and prolonged durability compared to conventional electrochemical CGMs. Here, we report a computational CGM system, which integrates a biocompatible phosphorescence-based insertable biosensor and a custom-designed phosphorescence lifetime imager (PLI). This compact and cost-effective PLI is designed to capture phosphorescence lifetime images of an insertable sensor through the skin, where the lifetime of the emitted phosphorescence signal is modulated by the local concentration of glucose. Because this phosphorescence signal has a very long lifetime compared to tissue autofluorescence or excitation leakage processes, it completely bypasses these noise sources by measuring the sensor emission over several tens of microseconds after the excitation light is turned off. The lifetime images acquired through the skin are processed by neural network-based models for misalignment-tolerant inference of glucose levels, accurately revealing normal, low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) concentration ranges. Using a 1-mm thick skin phantom mimicking the optical properties of human skin, we performed in vitro testing of the PLI using glucose-spiked samples, yielding 88.8% inference accuracy, also showing resilience to random and unknown misalignments within a lateral distance of ~4.7 mm with respect to the position of the insertable sensor underneath the skin phantom. Furthermore, the PLI accurately identified larger lateral misalignments beyond 5 mm, prompting user intervention for re-alignment. The misalignment-resilient glucose concentration inference capability of this compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager makes it an appealing wearable diagnostics tool for real-time tracking of glucose and other biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Stability of monodomain III-V crystals and antiphase boundaries over a Si monoatomic step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we compare the stabilities of different III-V crystals configurations on stepped Si substrates, with or without anti-phase boundaries, for abrupt and compensated interfaces, using density functional theory. Thermodynamic stability of the different heterostructures is analyzed with an atomic scale description of charge densities distribution and mechani-cal strain. We show that the configuration where a III-V crystal adapts to a Si monoatomic step through change of charge compensation at the hetero-interface is much more stable than the configuration in which an antiphase boundary is formed. This study thus demonstrates that antiphase boundaries commonly observed in III-V/Si samples are not origi-nating from Si monoatomic step edges but from inevitable kinetically driven coalescence of monophase 3D III-V islands.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Q degradation in low-loss Si3N4 from heterogeneous laser integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance, high-volume-manufacturing Si3N4 photonics requires extremely low waveguide losses augmented with heterogeneously integrated lasers for applications beyond traditional markets of high-capacity interconnects. State-of-the-art quality factors (Q) over 200 million at 1550 nm have been shown previously; however, maintaining high Qs throughout laser fabrication has not been shown. Here, Si3N4 resonator intrinsic Qs over 100 million are demonstrated on a fully integrated heterogeneous laser platform. Qi is measured throughout laser processing steps, showing degradation down to 50 million from dry etching, metal evaporation, and ion implant steps, and controllable recovery to over 100 million from annealing at 250C - 350C.</description>

      <title>Integration of through-sapphire substrate machining with superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate-scale quantum processors. The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, we present a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits. This technique immediately provides a means to scale QPUs with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <title>A green solvent system for precursor phase-engineered sequential deposition of stable formamidinium lead triiodide for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer an efficient, inexpensive alternative to current photovoltaic technologies, with the potential for manufacture via high-throughput coating methods. However, challenges for commercial-scale solution-processing of metal-halide perovskites include the use of harmful solvents, the expense of maintaining controlled atmospheric conditions, and the inherent instabilities of PSCs under operation. Here, we address these challenges by introducing a high volatility, low toxicity, biorenewable solvent system to fabricate a range of 2D perovskites, which highly effective precursor phases for subsequent transformation to alpha-formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), fully processed under ambient conditions. PSCs utilising our FAPbI3 reproducibly show remarkable stability under illumination and elevated temperature (ISOS-L-2) and "damp heat" (ISOS-D-3) stressing, surpassing other state-of-the-art perovskite compositions. We determine that this enhancement is a consequence of the 2D precursor phase crystallisation route, which simultaneously avoids retention of residual low-volatility solvents (such as DMF and DMSO) and reduces the rate of degradation of FA+ in the material. Our findings highlight both the critical role of the initial crystallisation process in determining the operational stability of perovskite materials, and that neat FA+-based perovskites can be competitively stable despite the inherent metastability of the alpha-phase.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-scale nanomechanical resonators with low dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-aspect-ratio mechanical resonators are pivotal in precision sensing, from macroscopic gravitational wave detectors to nanoscale acoustics. However, fabrication challenges and high computational costs have limited the length-to-thickness ratio of these devices, leaving a largely unexplored regime in nano-engineering. We present nanomechanical resonators that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore this expanded design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive centimeter-scale design optimization. By employing delicate nanofabrication techniques, our approach ensures high-yield realization, experimentally confirming room-temperature quality factors close to theoretical predictions. The synergy between nanofabrication, design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens a solid-state path to room-temperature quality factors approaching 10 billion at kilohertz mechanical frequencies -- comparable to the performance of leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.</description>

      <title>Parametric Modeling of Serpentine Waveguide Traveling Wave Tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple and fast model for numerically calculating small-signal gain in serpentine waveguide traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) is described. In the framework of the Pierce model, we consider one-dimensional electron flow along a dispersive single-mode slow-wave structure (SWS), accounting for the space-charge effect. The analytical model accounts for the frequency-dependent phase velocity and characteristic impedance obtained using various equivalent circuit models from the literature, validated by comparison with full-wave eigenmode simulation. The model includes a relation between the modal characteristic impedance and the interaction (Pierce) impedance of the SWS, including also an extra correction factor that accounts for the variation of the electric field distribution and hence of the interaction impedance over the beam cross section. By applying boundary conditions to our generalized Pierce model, we compute both the theoretical gain of a TWT and all the complex-valued wavenumbers of the hot modes versus frequency and compare our results with numerically intensive particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations; the good agreement in the comparison demonstrates the accuracy and simplicity of our generalized model. For various examples where we vary the average electron beam (e-beam) phase velocity, average e-beam current, number of unit cells, and input radio frequency (RF) power, we demonstrate that our model is robust in the small-signal regime.</description>

      <title>Gemini &amp; Physical World: Large Language Models Can Estimate the Intensity of Earthquake Shaking from Multi-Modal Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to extract scientifically valuable information about Earth's physical phenomena from unconventional sources, such as multi-modal social media posts. Employing a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Reid et al. 2024), we estimate earthquake ground shaking intensity from these unstructured posts. The model's output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, aligns well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that LLMs, trained on vast internet data, may have developed a unique understanding of physical phenomena. Specifically, Google's Gemini models demonstrate a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, accurately describing observational data even though it's not identical to established models. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent to which Gemini's training has led to a broader understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Generative AI models like Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights their potential to augment our understanding of complex physical phenomena like earthquakes. The flexible and effective approach proposed in this study holds immense potential for enriching our understanding of the impact of physical phenomena and improving resilience during natural disasters. This research is a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for natural disaster mitigation, opening new avenues for understanding the emerging capabilities of Generative AI and LLMs for scientific applications.</description>

      <title>For sky-facing passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8-13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of sky-facing SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is usually slightly better, but the difference in cooling power is small, at most 1-2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>
