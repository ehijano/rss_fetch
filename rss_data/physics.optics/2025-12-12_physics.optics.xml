      <title>The role of modes in nonlinear fiber optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear propagation of light in graded-index multimode fiber, utilizing it as an optical computing unit, and quantify how it employs waveguide modes to process information. Using a time-dependent spatiotemporal propagation model with modal decomposition, we evaluate several benchmark regression and classification tasks and study the modal content of the generated speckles, which couples with a simple digital layer to perform optical computing. Analysis of modal entropy and energy-based mode counts reveals that effective computation is confined to a low-dimensional modal subspace, whose identity depends on the task and propagation regime. This also sets a trade-off between modal richness and nonlinear beam self-cleaning. These results establish modal statistics as practical design metrics for fiber-based optical computers.</description>

      <title>Generation of Perfectly Achromatic Optical Vortices Using a Compensated Tandem Twisted Nematic Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space non-Hermitian skin effect in an exciton-polariton system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Laser Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first proof-of-concept demonstrations of photoluminescence-based optical refrigeration, solid-state laser cooling has developed into a credible competitor to conventional cryogenic technologies. Solid-state laser cooling continues to advance as new materials push cooling limits. These developments have created a need to consolidate progress made to date as well as standardize critical experimental considerations needed for reliable and verifiable cooling measurements. This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors. It additionally highlights emerging applications of solid-state optical refrigeration. To strengthen the consistency and reproducibility of cooling results going forward, two reporting checklists are introduced. They cover materials, cooling metrics, and thermometry. This primer is intended to serve as both a tutorial and a practical reference for incoming and existing researchers involved in solid-state laser-cooling.</description>

      <title>Heteronuclear and Homonuclear Vector Solitons in Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector solitons (VSs), being observed across various fields from optics to Bose-Einstein condensates, are localized structures composed of orthogonal modes bound by nonlinear couplings. Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources.</description>

      <title>An Extended Mixed Quantum/Classical Approach for Quantitative Calculation of Complex Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed quantum/classical approach of Skinner and co-workers has been widely used to calculate the line shapes of the infrared spectra of water (H2O), but less attention has been paid to the use of this approach in quantitatively calculating spectral intensity, thereby limiting direct comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water.</description>

      <title>Pockels effect induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a lithium niobate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of Kerr nonlinearity in lithium niobate has been extensively investigated over the years. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Deep Photonic Reservoir Computing with On-chip Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing, renowned for its low training cost, has emerged as a promising lightweight paradigm for efficient spatiotemporal processing,it remains challenging to realize deep photonic reservoir computing (DPRC) systems, due to the lack of scalable on-chip nonlinearity. Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making.</description>

      <title>Spatial-spectral mapping for long-duration broadband terahertz pulse generation in on-chip waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to terahertz (THz) pulse generation are restricted by the Fourier-transform limit, which hinders the creation of sources that combine long duration with broad bandwidth--a capability crucial for many spectroscopic and sensing applications. In this work, we overcome this challenge in the terahertz domain using an on-chip gradient waveguide array. The key is to spectrally disperse the pulse into spatially separated channels within a lithium niobate chip, effectively decoupling the design of temporal and spectral properties. We validate the source by distinguishing amino acid mixtures, demonstrating its tailored biosensing potential. This work establishes a novel mechanism for integrated THz generation, offering considerable promise for broadband spectroscopy and on-chip photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Q chiral resonances empowered by multi-head attention deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality (Q) factor optical chiral resonators are indispensable for many chiral photonic devices. Designing ultrahigh Q-factors in chiral metasurfaces traditionally relies on extensive parameter scanning, which is time-consuming and inefficient. While deep learning now provides a rapid design alternative, conventional models still face challenges in accurately predicting ultrahigh Q-factor spectral characteristics. In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces. MuHAN achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, thousands of times faster than finite-difference time-domain simulations, boasting 99.85% and 99.9% accuracy for forward and inverse predictions, respectively. By transferring the learned physical principles, we perform inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors (up to 2.9910E5) based on chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) at minimal computational cost. Our rapid design tool, based on MuHAN, enables high-performance encryption imaging, bridging deep learning with high-Q chiral metasurfaces for advanced sensing, laser, and detection applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for scalable and broadband free-space phase-matched four-wave mixing in ring resonators. This method for four-wave mixing reduces the complexity of coupling an emitter to a quantum network by combining the spatial and spectral interfaces between them into one nonlinear optical process. The device is compliant with current heterogeneous integration capabilities and has a bandwidth of 165 nm for efficient spatio-spectral conversion. We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network. This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.</description>

      <title>Optical fuse based on the photorefractive effect for defending the light-injection attacks of quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic generation of entangled travelling fields with different polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</description>

      <title>All-photonic entanglement swapping with remote quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optical Links for Controlling Bosonic Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities. However, scaling up large quantum processors is limited by the cumbersome and heat-conductive electronic cables that connect room-temperature control electronics to quantum processors, leading to significant signal attenuation. Optical fibers provide a promising solution, but their use has been restricted to controlling simple two-level quantum systems over short distances. Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying classical and quantum bounds for resolving closely spaced, non-interacting, simultaneously emitting dipole sources in optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.</description>

      <title>Rapid multi-mode trapped-ion laser cooling in a phase-stable standing wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $\mu$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.</description>

Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Microring resonator as a Rayleigh mirror for broadband laser-cavity comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality microring resonators (MRRs) have proven to be promising sources of optical combs generated from continuous-wave radiation. In addition to the primary comb that propagates along with the pump, Rayleigh scattering creates a comb that travels in the opposite direction. Normally, the scattering is a very weak, however, in the high-quality-factor MRR the power transferred to the backward-propagating comb can be quite significant. We demonstrate that the backward-propagating comb can be used as a feedback source for a fiber laser, effectively creating a nonlinear mirror for the laser cavity. By assembling a simple laser cavity comprising only active fiber and two mirrors, one of which is an integrated MRR, we show a robust self-starting comb generation with width exceeding 500 nm. We confirm the universal character of this approach for other types of microresonators, including whispering gallery mode resonators, by launching self-starting laser cavity combs with the crystalline toroidal cavity, coupled with a tapered fiber. This method provides significant simplification for the filter-driven laser cavity soliton generation, especially when free-space coupling is applied.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) have opened a new frontier in animal behavior studies, enabling real-time imaging of neuron activity while leaving animals largely unconstrained. Canonical designs typically use Gradient-Index (GRIN) lenses or refractive lenses as the objective module for excitation and fluorescence collection, but GRIN lenses suffer from aberrations and refractive lenses are bulky and complex. Meta-optics, composed of subwavelength diffractive elements, offer a promising alternative by combining multiple functionalities with significantly reduced footprint and weight. Here, we present meta-optical miniscopes that integrate functionalities including large field of view (FOV), extended depth of focus (EDOF), and depth sensitivity. These meta-optics replace the traditional refractive lens assembly, reducing the total track length of the objective module from 6.7 mm to 2.5 mm while enhancing imaging performance. Our results demonstrate that meta-optical miniscopes can expand the miniscope toolbox and facilitate the development of more compact and multifunctional imaging systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an all-fiber design for a Tm-based fiber amplifier that can tune over 1992-2065 nm with 300-350 W single-frequency (&lt;100 kHz) output. Over 180 W is achieved out to 2085 nm with &lt;10% ASE content without utilizing ASE spectral filters. The amplifier employs both Tm- and Tm/Ho-doped gain fibers in two preamplifier stages in addition to longer sections of Tm fiber to extend the bandwidth of the Tm-based high-power amplifier to longer wavelengths (&gt;2050 nm). Efficiencies of 55% are realized across the full bandwidth. Roll-off occurs beyond 2085 nm where ASE becomes intractable. The amplifier has an average M^2 value of 1.39 at high-power due to the presence of light guided within the fiber pedestal. Estimates of the pedestal light and higher-order mode contents are provided.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\text{{\div}}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \text{{\div}} 10^4$.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type pattern of nearest-neighbor couplings in combination with the longer-range interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control of topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>
