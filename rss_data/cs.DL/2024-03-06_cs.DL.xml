      <title>AceMap: Knowledge Discovery through Academic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature requires effective management and extraction of valuable insights. While existing scientific search engines excel at delivering search results based on relational databases, they often neglect the analysis of collaborations between scientific entities and the evolution of ideas, as well as the in-depth analysis of content within scientific publications. The representation of heterogeneous graphs and the effective measurement, analysis, and mining of such graphs pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we present AceMap, an academic system designed for knowledge discovery through academic graph. We present advanced database construction techniques to build the comprehensive AceMap database with large-scale academic publications that contain rich visual, textual, and numerical information. AceMap also employs innovative visualization, quantification, and analysis methods to explore associations and logical relationships among academic entities. AceMap introduces large-scale academic network visualization techniques centered on nebular graphs, providing a comprehensive view of academic networks from multiple perspectives. In addition, AceMap proposes a unified metric based on structural entropy to quantitatively measure the knowledge content of different academic entities. Moreover, AceMap provides advanced analysis capabilities, including tracing the evolution of academic ideas through citation relationships and concept co-occurrence, and generating concise summaries informed by this evolutionary process. In addition, AceMap uses machine reading methods to generate potential new ideas at the intersection of different fields. Exploring the integration of large language models and knowledge graphs is a promising direction for future research in idea evolution.

      <title>PaperWeaver: Enriching Topical Paper Alerts by Contextualizing Recommended Papers with User-collected Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of scholarly archives, researchers subscribe to "paper alert" systems that periodically provide them with recommendations of recently published papers that are similar to previously collected papers. However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users' research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.</description>

      <title>Preserving Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage: the Cases of Volterra and Atari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At first glance, the ruins of the Roman Theatre in the Italian town of Volterra have little in common with cassette tapes containing Atari games. One is certainly considered an important historical landmark, while the consensus on the importance of the other is partial at best. Still, both are remnants of times vastly different from the present and are at risk of oblivion. Unearthed architectural structures are exposed to the elements just as the deteriorating signals stored on magnetic tapes. However, the rate of deterioration is much faster with the magnetic media, as their life expectancy is counted in decades, whereas the Roman Theater, which is already in ruin, measures its lifespan in centuries. Hence, both would benefit from some form of digital preservation and reconstruction. In this panel, we discuss how to sustainably preserve tangible and intangible cultural artifacts for future generations.</description>
