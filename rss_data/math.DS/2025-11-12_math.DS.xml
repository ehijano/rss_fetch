      <title>On the Regularity of the Dimension of Cookie-Cutter-Like Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions of cookie-cutter-like sets formed by sequential dynamics of a finite number of expanding maps. Under some natural conditions, these dimensions turn out to be the minimum and maximum of the corresponding dimensions of the cookie-cutter sets generated by the individual expanding maps. In the case of one-parameter families of such systems, this provides a simple mechanism for producing non-differentiable fractal dimensions as functions of the parameter. This supports a conjecture that the Hausdorff dimension of the spectrum of a Sturmian Hamiltonian, in general, does not have to be differentiable as a function of the coupling constant. This is in drastic contrast to the analytic dependence of the dimensions of such spectra with quadratic irrational frequencies, e.g. the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, previously shown by M. Pollicott.</description>

      <title>The First Mathematical Model for Elk Wolf Interaction in Yellowstone National Park Using the E-SINDy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the prey predator dynamics of the elk wolf system in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA, using a data driven modeling approach. We used yearly population data for elk and wolves from 1995 to 2022 to construct a mathematical model using a sparse regression modeling framework. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has applied this framework to capture elk wolf interactions over this time period. Our modeling pipeline integrates Gaussian process regression for data smoothing, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics for model discovery, and model selection techniques to identify the most suitable mathematical representation. The resulting model is analyzed for its nonlinear dynamics with ecologically meaningful parameters. Stability and bifurcation analyzes are then performed to understand the systems qualitative behavior. A saddle node bifurcation identifies parameter ranges where both species can coexist, while regions outside this range may lead to the extinction of one or both populations. Hopf and saddle node bifurcations together delineate zones of stable co existence, periodic oscillations, and extinction scenarios. Furthermore, co dimension two bifurcations, including Bogdanov Takens and cusp bifurcations, are explored by varying two parameters simultaneously. Ecologically, these bifurcations reflect the complex interplay between wolf pressure and elk defence mechanisms, such as grouping or herd behavior. They suggested that small changes in ecological parameters can lead to sudden shifts in population outcomes ranging from stable co existence to extinction or oscillatory cycles.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and entropy for open set-valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of set-valued maps whose graphs are open and such that the image of each point is an open and connected set. Building upon the work of P. Duarte and M. Torres, who introduced and analyzed the combinatorial structure of the final recurrent set, we incorporate the notions of transitivity and mixing, thereby bringing their framework into the spirit of Smale's spectral decomposition theorem. We also demonstrate that such maps exhibit infinite topological entropy, and we establish a connection between transitive open set-valued maps and transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Carleman Linearization of Nonlinear Dynamical System: Insights from a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are widely encountered in various scientific and engineering fields. Despite significant advances in theoretical understanding, developing complete and integrated frameworks for analyzing and designing these systems remains challenging, which underscores the importance of efficient linearization methods. In this paper, we introduce a general linearization framework with emphasis on Carleman linearization and Carleman-Fourier linearization. A detailed case study on finite-section approximation to the lifted infinite-dimensional dynamical system is provided for the dynamical system with its governing function being a trigonometric polynomial of degree one.</description>

      <title>Metric entropy and homoclinic growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between chaos and homoclinic orbits from a quantitative perspective. Let f be a C^r diffeomorphism (r &gt; 1) on a compact Riemannian manifold preserving an ergodic hyperbolic measure. We show that the homoclinic growth rate is bounded below by the metric entropy.
  This result generalizes the work of Mendoza from surfaces to higher-dimensional systems from a measure-theoretic viewpoint. We also examine the sharpness of this estimate by demonstrating that, in the Newhouse domain, C^r-generic diffeomorphisms exhibit a superexponential growth in the number of homoclinic points.</description>

      <title>Algebraic correspondences and Schwarz reflections: Where rational dynamics meets Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the rapidly evolving field of dynamics of algebraic correspondences, with a focus on matings between rational maps and Kleinian groups. These correspondences exhibit rich dynamics, both within the Sullivan dictionary and beyond. We highlight unifying structures in their parameter spaces, showing how moduli spaces of rational maps and Kleinian groups naturally connect. We also outline a range of applications of the techniques developed in this framework and conclude with several promising directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a continuous data assimilation algorithm to recover the parameter $\alpha$ in the simplified Bardina model. Our method utilizes the observations of finitely many Fourier modes by using a nudging framework that involves recursive parameter updates. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that the approximated parameter approaches the true value under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Computations for the first Lyapunov coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are a supplementary file to the paper Hopf bifurcations for HANDY-type models (M. Badiale and I. Cravero, under submission), providing full details of the computations developed in Section 4.2. The purpose of this supplement is to derive explicitly the first Lyapunov coefficient associated with a Hopf bifurcation, following the framework of Yu. A. Kuznetsov (Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory, Springer, 4th ed., 2023). We compute the multilinear forms $B$ and $C$, the right and left eigenvectors and their normalization, and the resolvents $A^{-1}$ and $(2i\omega_0 I - A)^{-1}$. Using asymptotic expansions with respect to the small parameter $\varepsilon$, we derive explicit formulas for $\mu(\varepsilon)$, $\omega_0$, and the Lyapunov coefficient $a(\mu(\varepsilon),\varepsilon)$, which characterize the criticality of the Hopf bifurcation in the main model.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for quasi-periodic Jacobi block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for discrete quasiperiodic Jacobi $d\times d$ block matrices with Diophantine frequencies. The H\"older exponent is shown to be any $\beta$ such that $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/(2\kappa^d)$, where $\kappa^d$ is the acceleration, i.e., the slope of the sum of the top $d$ Lyapunov exponents in the imaginary direction of the phase. This generalizes the H\"older continuity results in the Schr\"odinger operator setting in \cites{GS2,HS1}, and also strengthens them in that setting by covering more Diophantine frequencies. The proof is built on a new scheme for obtaining a local zero count for finite-volume characteristic polynomials from a global one.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Estimation over Sensor Networks with Partially Unknown Source Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed adaptive estimation over sensor networks with partially known source dynamics. We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes.</description>

      <title>Flow primitives and infinitesimal generators of Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman and the Perron-Frobenius operators are increasingly becoming popular in the control of complex nonlinear systems such as in a wide variety of robotics problems and flow control. This is in addition to the wide interest in the application of operator methods for better understanding of fluid flows. A particular problem of relevance to all such applications is, how does the Koopman or the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator change if the underlying vector field of the dynamical system undergoes small changes or if two vector fields are added. The current numerical methods rely on significant computations and model or parameter changes to the dynamical system often require all the computations to be repeated. This paper reports on a novel approach to the computation of the approximate PF and Koopman operators in such cases. The approach makes use of the exponentials of the infinitesimal generators of these operators. It is shown that this approximation depends on the Lie bracket of the vector field and the perturbation vector field. Examples are described where the Koopman and PF operators are constructed from operators of primitive flows and for cases where the model parameters undergo perturbations.</description>

      <title>Matters of Life and Death in Computational Cell Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly all cell models explicitly or implicitly deal with the biophysical constraints that must be respected for life to persist. Despite this, there is almost no systematicity in how these constraints are implemented, and we lack a principled understanding of how cellular dynamics interact with them and how they originate in actual biology. Computational cell biology will only overcome these concerns once it treats the life-death boundary as a central concept, creating a theory of cellular viability. We lay the foundation for such a development by demonstrating how specific geometric structures can separate regions of qualitatively similar survival outcomes in our models, offering new global organizing principles for cell fate. We also argue that idealized models of emergent individuals offer a tractable way to begin understanding life's intrinsically generated limits.</description>

      <title>Twisted operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary directed graphs together with $\mathbb{T}$-valued twists that exhaust the second cohomology group of the associated Zappa-Sz\'ep product category. We define and analyse the associated universal, reduced, and essential $C^*$-algebras, along with their Toeplitz versions and core subalgebras. In fact, we develop our theory in the more general setting of $L^P$-operator algebras, where $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$ is any non-empty set of parameters. This includes $C^*$-algebras, $L^p$-operator algebras and symmetrised $L^{p,*}$-operator algebras for $p\in [1,\infty]$, as special cases.
  We use three complementary approaches: twisted inverse semigroups, twisted ample groupoids, and $C^*$-correspondences. We provide, in terms of the self-similar action, general characterisations of topological freeness, minimality, Hausdorffness, finite non-Hausdorffness, effectiveness, and local contractiveness for the associated ample groupoids. We generalise the classical Cuntz--Krieger Uniqueness and Coburn--Toeplitz Uniqueness Theorems for graph $C^*$-algebras to twisted $L^P$-operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions. We characterise when the natural inclusions are Cartan, give checkable criteria for simplicity and pure infiniteness of the essential algebras, and discuss when the universal and reduced algebras coincide.
  We also provide conditions that ensure the singular ideals vanish. Using the groupoid model we show that for any $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$, the $L^P$-operator algebra of a contracting self-similar action is simple if and only if the corresponding Steinberg algebra is simple. Using the Toeplitz-Pimsner model, we prove that for the universal groupoid of any self-similar groupoid action on a row-finite graph, the singular $C^*$-algebraic ideal always vanishes.</description>

      <title>Local Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstacle avoidance and path planning are essential for guiding unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through environments that are densely populated with dynamic obstacles. This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.</description>

Abstract: Zhong-Ping Jiang devoted a large part of his work to the study of the stability properties of interconnected systems. In this short paper we celebrate Zhong-Ping Jiang's 60th birthday by studying a special class of families of interconnected systems: the so-called strings. We develop trajectory-based and Lyapunov-based tools that allow the verification of string stability to homogeneous bidirectional strings. The obtained results are applied to the problem of cruise controller design for a string of vehicles.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Symmetric Binary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mandelbrot and Frame studied the geometry of self-contracting symmetric binary trees in which they stated that the height of such trees occurred at the branch tip of the path consisting of branches that alternate left and right. Taylor proved that this happens for both self-avoiding as well as self-contacting symmetric binary trees (if we ignore the height of the trunk and just consider the branch tips). In his commentary on the work by Mandelbrot and Frame, West gave an example of a self-overlapping tree in which this alternating left-right path does not give the highest point of the tree, and said that more analysis was needed. In this paper we show how such examples can be constructed for all but a countable number of angles. We also investigate the conditions for when the sides and bottom of a self-overlapping symmetric binary tree differ from what happens with self-avoiding and self-contacting trees.</description>

      <title>Orders of Oscillation Motivated by Sarnak's Conjecture--Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of [13]. We study the linear disjointness between higher-order oscillating sequences and nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we prove that any oscillating sequence of order $m=d+k-1$ and any simple polynomial skew product of degree $k$ on the $d$-Euclidean space are linearly disjoint. Additionally, we demonstrate that any oscillating sequence of order $d$ and any minimal mean attractable and minimal quasi-discrete spectrum dynamical system of order $d$ are linearly disjoint. Finally, we introduce multi-linearly disjoint sequences and construct examples of such sequences.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of gauge transform has its origin in Physics (Field Theory). In the present note we discuss -- from a purely mathematical perspective -- special gauge transforms of autonomous first order ODE's and their special properties. Particular attention is given to the problem of identifying those nonautonomous ODE's which are gauge transforms of autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>On Entropic Characterization of Symmetry Breaking in Dynamical Systems I: Spontaneous and Dynamical Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework to analyze symmetry breaking in dynamical systems through the lens of entropy and information transfer. Information transfer quantifies the directional exchange of entropy between observables, allowing us to anticipate the onset of symmetry breaking. For local symmetry breakings, namely, local Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) and Dynamical Symmetry Breaking (DSB), we show that as a system loses symmetry, its trajectories exhibit a pronounced slowdown accompanied by an increase in Shannon entropy. This establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, dynamical slowing down, and entropy growth. We also extend the analysis to global symmetry breaking and characterize its associated entropy change. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework using representative examples, showing that information theoretic quantities can serve as reliable precursors and diagnostics of symmetry breaking transitions.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Furstenberg measures on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\theta$ be a finitely supported probability measure on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and suppose that the semigroup generated by $\mathcal{G}:=\mathrm{supp}(\theta)$ is strongly irreducible and proximal. Let $\mu$ denote the Furstenberg measure on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ associated to $\theta$. Assume further that no generalized circle is fixed by all M\"obius transformations corresponding to elements of $\mathcal{G}$, and that $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies a mild Diophantine condition. Under these assumptions, we prove that $\dim\mu=\min\left\{ 2,h_{\mathrm{RW}}/\left(2\chi\right)\right\} $, where $h_{\mathrm{RW}}$ and $\chi$ denote the random walk entropy and Lyapunov exponent associated to $\theta$, respectively.
  Since our result expresses $\dim\mu$ in terms of the random walk entropy rather than the Furstenberg entropy, and relies only on a mild Diophantine condition as a separation assumption, we are forced to directly confront difficulties arising from the ambient space $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ having real dimension $2$ rather than $1$. Moreover, our analysis takes place in a projective, contracting-on-average setting. This combination of features introduces significant challenges and requires genuinely new ideas.</description>

      <title>Index theory for singular Lagrangian systems and Bessel-type differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present manuscript is to develop an index theory for singular Lagrangian systems, with a particular focus on the important class of singular operators given by Bessel type differential operators. The main motivation is to address several challenges posed by singular operators, which appear in a wide range of applications: celestial mechanics (for instance, perturbations in planetary motion), oscillatory systems with time dependent forcing, electromagnetism (such as wave equations in nonuniform media), and quantum mechanics (notably certain Schroedinger equations with periodic potentials).
  We pursue two principal objectives. First, we establish a spectral flow formula and a Morse Index Theorem for gap-continuous paths of singular Sturm Liouville operators. By means of these index formulas, we construct a Morse index theory for a broad class of Bessel type differential operators and apply it to a family of asymptotic solutions of the gravitational n body problem.
  Finally, our new index theory provides new insight into a phenomenon first observed by Rellich concerning the spectrum of one-parameter families of Sturm Liouville operators with varying domains.</description>

      <title>Higher Cheeger ratios of features in Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates links between the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the higher Cheeger constants of smooth Riemannian manifolds, possibly weighted and/or with boundary. The higher Cheeger constants give a loose description of the major geometric features of a manifold. We give a constructive upper bound on the higher Cheeger constants, in terms of the eigenvalue of any eigenfunction with the corresponding number of nodal domains. Specifically, we show that for each such eigenfunction, a positive-measure collection of its superlevel sets have their Cheeger ratios bounded above in terms of the corresponding eigenvalue.
  Some manifolds have their major features entwined across several eigenfunctions, and no single eigenfunction contains all the major features. In this case, there may exist carefully chosen linear combinations of the eigenfunctions, each with large values on a single feature, and small values elsewhere. We can then apply a soft-thresholding operator to these linear combinations to obtain new functions, each supported on a single feature. We show that the Cheeger ratios of the level sets of these functions also give an upper bound on the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues. We extend these level set results to nonautonomous dynamical systems, and show that the dynamic Laplacian eigenfunctions reveal sets with small dynamic Cheeger ratios.</description>

      <title>Prime numbers and dynamics of the polynomial $x^2-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</description>

      <title>Autoencoding Dynamics: Topological Limitations and Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space" $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an "encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon \mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems having $M$ as an invariant manifold.</description>
