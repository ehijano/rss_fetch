      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Operator Learning for Computational Hydraulics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional 2D hydraulic models face significant computational challenges that limit their applications that are time-sensitive or require many model evaluations. This study presents a physics-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework for computational hydraulics modeling that learns the solution operator of the 2D shallow water equations (SWEs) to create fast surrogate models. The framework can operate in two modes: a purely data-driven SWE-DeepONet that learns from numerical solver such as SRH-2D, and a physics-informed PI-SWE-DeepONet that additionally incorporates the continuous SWEs as constraints during training. Based on a real-world case, steady flows in a reach of the Sacramento River in California, it is demonstrated that PI-SWE-DeepONet possesses much enhanced prediction capability than SWE-DeepONet when applied to out-of-distribution scenarios. The physics-informed model is shown to exhibit slower error growth and larger breakdown distances in comparison with SWE-DeepONet. The gain of the physics-informed training, however, comes with costs, chief among which are the simulated results have slightly higher errors for in-distribution cases. It reflects the existence of a tension between the two competing training objectives: fitting the results from the traditional hydraulic model and satisfying the continuous governing equations. In this study, guidelines are developed for selecting the appropriate approach based on a real-world case: PI-SWE-DeepONet is preferred for out-of-distribution predictions, uncertain training data, or when physical consistency is a priority, while SWE-DeepONet is recommended if the modeling objective is to replicate faithfully the traditional hydraulic model results within the training distribution. Other challenges are also discussed, such as the loss weighting approach.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Applicability of Friction Velocity Estimation Methods for the Channel with A Deposit Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how the deposit body influences friction characteristics by altering local flow fields, which is closely related to bed shear stress. Using generalized flume experiments, the study assesses the applicability of classical uniform flow friction models in deposit body river sections, revealing frictional changes induced by flow field non-uniformity. Initially, based on \( \frac{u_*}{\sqrt{\overline{w'^2}}} = 0.85 \sim 1.15 \) under uniform flow conditions as the judgment basis, the reliability of the classical model is verified. Four models are then applied to estimate near-bed friction velocity in deposit body sections. Results show a significant alignment between the longitudinal velocity gradient and the peak friction velocity derived from the turbulent kinetic energy method (TKE). Dimensional analysis of friction indicators reveals that: (a) friction velocity is primarily influenced by turbulence intensity, with constricted and narrowed sections resembling uniform flow, while the expansion section forms a peak; (b) models incorporating flow field fluctuations (TKE, Vertical Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE w'), Reynolds shear stress method (RSS)) effectively capture the impact of non-uniform flow fields on friction characteristics; (c) when energy states are low or when deposit body proportions are large, the deposit body's resistance ratio increases, and peak friction velocity rises. This study provides theoretical insights into friction estimation and sediment transport in non-uniform flow fields of deposit bodies.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann methods for simulating non-Newtonian fluids: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Newtonian fluids encompass a large family of fluids with additional nonlinear material properties, contributing to non-trivial flow behaviour that cannot be captured through a single constant viscosity term. Common non-Newtonian characteristics include shear-thinning, shear-thickening, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity, commonly encountered in everyday fluids, such as ketchup, blood, toothpaste, mud, etc., as well as practical applications involving porous media, cosmetics, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. Due to the complex nature of these fluids, accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations are essential for predicting their behaviour under various flow conditions. Recent advancements have highlighted the growing trend of using the lattice Boltzmann method to solve such complex flows, owing to its ability to handle intricate boundary conditions, ease of including additional multiphysics, and providing computationally efficient parallel simulations. Since the initial review over a decade ago [Phillips &amp; Roberts, IMA J. Appl. Math. 76, 790-816 (2011)], significant advancements have been made to the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate non-Newtonian fluids. Here, we present a comprehensive review of different lattice Boltzmann techniques used to solve non-Newtonian fluid systems, specifically dealing with shear-dependent viscosity, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity. In addition, we discuss various benchmark cases that validate these approaches and highlight their growing application to realistic and challenging complex flow problems. We further address outstanding issues in current lattice Boltzmann models, as well as future directions for numerical advancement and application.</description>

      <title>Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>

      <title>Chirality tomography: measuring local helicity from trajectory linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional helicity maps of fully developed turbulence obtained through chirality tomography, a Lagrangian voxel-based method that reconstructs helicity density from particle trajectories. Our approach builds on an empirically established relation between helicity and trajectory linking, converting local counts of signed crossings $K$ into volumetric maps of dimensionless helicity, $H(\mathbf{x})$. We demonstrate that the entanglement of particle trajectories, quantified by the mean signed crossing number, provides a robust proxy for helicity, not only at the global scale, but also locally in space and time. Our method can reveal local spatial heterogeneities in helicity and relate them to large-scale flow organization, enabling the reconstruction of spatially resolved chiral structures. Applied to von K\'arm\'an experiments and Taylor-Green direct numerical simulations, the method reveals iso-helicity surfaces and coherent chiral features, while time series of $K$ accurately track the evolution of domain-averaged helicity. The proportionality between $K$ and $H$ remains robust across different voxel geometries and different values of particle inertia, but is not held in laminar or time-modulated flows. This study shows that chirality tomography provides a practical helicity diagnostic in turbulent flows, while establishing a direct bridge between trajectory-level topology and a fundamental dynamical invariant of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spots in hypersonic transitional planar and axisymmetric boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments were conducted to investigate characteristics of turbulent spots formed in transitional boundary layers developed over a flat plate and an axisymmetric cone placed in similar hypersonic freestream environment of Mach number 5.85. The freestream Reynolds number in the present work varied between $3.0-6.0\times10^6$/m. Heat transfer measurement along the surface of both the test models was used to ascertain the state of boundary layer and to calculate the intermittency associated with transitional boundary layer. Turbulent spots generated in the transitional boundary layer were characterized in terms of their leading-trailing edge velocities, their streamwise length scales and their generation rates on both the test models. Leading edge of the turbulent spots developed over both the test models were found to be convecting at a speed equivalent to 90\% of the boundary layer edge speed. The trailing edge of the spots developed on a planar boundary layer traversed at a lower speed than its axisymmetric counterpart. Streamwise length scales of a turbulent spot developed in a planar boundary layer grew at a higher rate when compared with axisymmetric boundary layer. Turbulent spot generation rates for both planar and axisymmetric boundary layers was found to be in the range of $1000000-3000000$ spots/m/s.</description>

      <title>Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Angled Aortic Cannulation Reduces Cerebral Embolic Transport and Adverse Wall Loading During Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Patient-Specific Hemodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embolic stroke during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is strongly influenced by cannula induced flow disturbances that govern emboli transport and aortic wall loading. This study quantifies how aortic cannula orientation affects embolic distribution and atherosclerotic plaque disruption risk across patient specific, age-dependent aortic anatomies under clinical CPB conditions. A validated computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle tracking (CFD-LPT) framework was applied to four patient-specific aortic models representing pediatric, adolescent, adult, and geriatric anatomies. Two clinically relevant cannula orientations: perpendicular (90 deg) and angled (30 deg), were evaluated under varying blood viscosities (1.5 to 3.5 cP) and embolus sizes (0.5 to 2.5 mm). Aortic branch exit percentage, wall pressure, and wall shear stress (WSS) were quantified. The 30 deg angled cannula reduced embolic transport into the aortic branches by 18 to 50 percent compared with perpendicular cannulation, with the largest reduction observed in the geriatric model. Perpendicular cannulation produced concentrated jet impingement, resulting in significantly elevated posterior wall pressure (24 percent) and up to an 8 fold increase in local WSS. The pediatric anatomy exhibited the highest sensitivity, where decreasing viscosity and increasing embolus size increased branch exit by 8.4 percent and 25 to 44 percent, respectively, consistent with higher particle Stokes numbers and inertial decoupling from the core flow. Angled cannulation redistributes jet momentum along the aortic curvature, weakens jet impingement, reduces localized pressure and wall stress, and limits embolic delivery towards the cerebral circulation. These findings provide mechanistic, patient-specific evidence supporting angled cannula orientation to reduce CPB complications.</description>

      <title>Spreading and absorption of silicone oil droplets on silicone elastomer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a liquid droplet completely wets a hard substrate, its spreading dynamics follow Tanner's law, with the droplet radius growing as the one-tenth power of time. Here, we investigate how these dynamics change when silicone oil droplets spread on soft silicone elastomer and gel films supported by a rigid silicon substrate. While the droplets fully wet the elastomer surface, they also simultaneously swell the elastomer film. By varying the film thickness, we observe deviations from the classical power-law scaling, which we interpret in terms of changes to the effective stiffness and the absorption potential of the system. We describe the spreading behavior using a phenomenological model that accounts for both absorption and mechanical contributions.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>

      <title>A Mesh-Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network for Unsteady Flow Around Oscillating and Rotating Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</description>

      <title>A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>On the Markovian assumption in near-wall turbulence: The case of particle resuspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Markovian assumption in modeling near-wall turbulence by analyzing the detachment of micron-sized particles from the viscous sublayer. By coupling direct numerical simulations with a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we demonstrate that while wall shear stress events follow Poissonian occurrence statistics, their internal dynamics exhibit strong temporal persistence (Hurst exponent $H \approx 0.84$), indicating non-Markovian memory. We reveal that the successful predictions of Markovian resuspension models stems from their free parameter acting as a phenomenological surrogate for flow memory. We further identify a critical regime transition governed by a wall shear stress events decay rate, $\lambda$. We identify a strong intermittency regime ($\lambda &lt; 0.2$), where coherent structures exhibit extended temporal correlations that cannot be mimicked by white noise. Conversely, rapid decays ($\lambda &gt; 0.2$) generate quasi-random fluctuations that justify the Markovian approximation. These findings offer a new perspective on the physical validity of classical stochastic modeling in wall-bounded flows.</description>

Abstract: Understanding turbulent boundary layer flows is important for many application areas. Enhanced theoretical models may provide deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms of turbulence that elude current models; therefore, the search for improved kinetic equations and their respective hydrodynamic equations continues. In this work, we consider the Generalized Boltzmann Equation (GBE), proposed by Alexeev (1994). The GBE accounts for finite particle size and the variation of the distribution function over timescales of the order of the collision time. The Alexeev hydrodynamic equations are derived from the GBE.
  In this work, the Alexeev hydrodynamic equations (AHE) and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved analytically for turbulent channel flow under the assumption that stationary solutions yield the mean flow velocity. The analytical solutions of the AHE are validated by numerical solutions and compared with the NS solutions and experimental data for turbulent channel flow from multiple sources, spanning Reynolds numbers from 3,000 to 35,000,000. Solutions of the AHE demonstrate significantly better agreement with experimental data than those obtained from the NS equations. The analytical solution revealed a new similarity parameter: the boundary layer thickness scale, which coincides with the Kolmogorov microscale observed in experiments. The mechanisms for turbulence generation and control are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fluid-inertia torques from particle-shape symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of particle motion in fluids at low particle Reynolds numbers is often based on empirical force and torque models obtained by fitting force and torque from ab-initio computations for simple particle shapes such as spheres, spheroids, or cylindrical disks and fibres. To do the same for more complex particles shapes, one needs to first know how particle shape constrains the dependence of force and torque on flow velocity, its gradient, and on particle orientation. Here we use symmetry analysis and perturbation theory to determine the form of the hydrodynamic torque on a particle settling in a quiescent fluid at low but non-zero particle Reynolds numbers, for particle shapes with different point-group symmetries. The symmetry conclusions are verified by comparing with explicit calculations for nearly spherical particles.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Time Geodesics as a Universal Framework for Transport and Transition Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for irreversible transport phenomena in which macroscopic evolution equations arise from the combined structure of a thermodynamic state metric and an Onsager-based dissipation metric. The construction begins by defining a pseudo-Riemannian manifold from the Hessian of an appropriate thermodynamic potential. When the enthalpy is used and written in variables (S,P), the resulting metric possesses a Lorentzian-type signature: entropy acts as a time-like coordinate, while pressure forms a spatial-like coordinate associated with mechanical response. Local irreversible dynamics are incorporated through the inverse Onsager matrix, which defines a positive-definite dissipation metric on the space of fluxes and gradients. A thermodynamic action integrating these two geometric layers yields geodesic evolution equations. For a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity, the resulting Euler--Lagrange equations reproduce the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations without requiring an externally imposed constitutive closure.
  Within this framework, turbulence scaling emerges from competition between inertial curvature and dissipation metric stiffness. The Kolmogorov length scale appears as a minimum geometric resolution length where these contributions balance, providing a geometric interpretation of energy cascade termination and dissipation onset. Finite-time singularities in the classical PDE formulation correspond to curvature divergences in the transport geometry; however, the thermodynamic proper time diverges in such limits, suggesting that blow-up is dynamically suppressed in single-phase continua.
  Although derived explicitly for fluid flow, the framework is general: by choosing different thermodynamic potentials and Onsager matrices, the same geometric formulation applies to heat conduction, diffusion and other irreversible processes.</description>

      <title>A Favre-Averaged Shallow Water Framework for Aerated Flows with Friction Factor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow resistance in high-Froude-number aerated flows remains challenging due to air entrainment, which causes strong spatial variability in mixture density. In this work, we introduce a density-weighted (Favre) averaging approach to rigorously account for vertical distributions of air concentration and velocity. Favre averaging naturally captures variations in mixture density induced by air entrainment, thereby enabling a density-consistent Shallow Water Equation (SWE) formulation for aerated flows. Within this framework, we present a novel Darcy-Weisbach friction factor formulation that decomposes contributions associated with uniform flow, spatially varying flow, and temporally evolving flow, and incorporates momentum and pressure correction factors reflecting the vertical structure of the mixture. Application to experimental data from the literature demonstrates that the Favre-averaged SWE framework provides a physically consistent means of quantifying effective friction. Overall, this work establishes a mechanistic, density-weighted methodology for modelling resistance in high-Froude-number aerated flows, provides new physical insight into the role of aeration in frictional dissipation, and lays a rational foundation for future modelling of unsteady and rapidly varied aerated flows.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free online learning of subgrid-scale dynamics with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19385v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to train machine learning-based subgrid parametrizations online, i.e., with \textit{a posteriori} loss functions, but for non-differentiable numerical solvers. The proposed approach leverages a neural emulator to approximate the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allow gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. We apply this methodology on a chaotic two-timescales Lorenz-96 system and a single layer quasi-geostrophic system with zonal dynamics, known to be highly unstable with offline strategies. Using our algorithm, we are able to train a parametrization that recovers most of the benefits of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver. We found that training the neural emulator and parametrization components separately with different loss quantities is necessary in order to minimize the propagation of approximation biases. Experiments on emulator architectures with different complexities also indicates that emulator performance is key in order to learn an accurate parametrization. This work is a step towards learning parametrization with online strategies for climate models.</description>
