      <title>Bridging the Gap between Partially Observable Stochastic Games and Sparse POMDP Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world decision problems involve interaction of multiple self-interested agents with limited sensing ability. The partially observable stochastic game (POSG) provides a mathematical framework for posing these problems, however solving a POSG requires difficult reasoning about two critical factors: (1) information revealed by partial observations and (2) decisions other agents make. In the single agent case, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) planning can efficiently address partial observability with particle filtering. In the multi-agent case, imperfect information game solution methods account for other agent's decisions, but preclude belief approximation. We propose a unifying framework that combines POMDP-inspired state distribution approximation and game-theoretic equilibrium search on information sets. This approach enables online planning in POSGs with very large state spaces, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in real-world physical environments and complementing offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. Experiments in several zero-sum examples show that the new framework computes solutions for problems with both small and large state spaces.</description>

      <title>Pessimism of the Will, Optimism of the Intellect: Fair Protocols with Malicious but Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness is a desirable and crucial property of many protocols that handle, for instance, exchanges of message.
  It states that if at least one agent engaging in the protocol is honest, then either the protocol will unfold correctly and fulfill its intended goal for all participants, or it will fail for everyone.
  In this work, we present a game-based framework for the study of fairness protocols, that does not define a priori an attacker model.
  It is based on the notion of strong secure equilibria, and leverages the conceptual and algorithmic toolbox of game theory.
  In the case of finite games, we provide decision procedures with tight complexity bounds for determining whether a protocol is immune to nefarious attacks from a coalition of participants, and whether such a protocol could exist based on the underlying graph structure and objectives.</description>

      <title>Federated Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A citizens' assembly is a group of people who are randomly selected to represent a larger population in a deliberation. While this approach has successfully strengthened democracy, it has certain limitations that suggest the need for assemblies to form and associate more organically. In response, we propose federated assemblies, where assemblies are interconnected, and each parent assembly is selected from members of its child assemblies. The main technical challenge is to develop random selection algorithms that meet new representation constraints inherent in this hierarchical structure. We design and analyze several algorithms that provide different representation guarantees under various assumptions on the structure of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Feedback of AI Price Estimations on Actual Market Values</title>

Abstract: Public availability of Artificial Intelligence generated information can change the markets forever, and its factoring into economical dynamics may take economists by surprise, out-dating models and schools of thought. Real estate hyper-inflation is not a new phenomenon but its consistent and almost monotonous persistence over 12 years, coinciding with prominence of public estimation information from Zillow, a successful Mass Real Estate Estimator (MREE), could not escape unobserved. What we model is a repetitive theoretical game between the MREE and the home owners, where each player has secret information and expertise. If the intention is to keep housing affordable and maintain old American lifestyle with broad home-ownership, new challenges are defined. Simulations show that a simple restriction of MREE-style price estimation availability to opt-in properties may help partially reduce feedback loop by acting on its likely causes, as suggested by experimental simulation models. The conjecture that the MREE pressure on real estate inflation rate is correlated with the absolute MREE estimation errors, which is logically explainable, is then validated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Falsifiable Test Design in Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A principal can propose a project to an agent, who then decides whether to accept. Their payoffs from launching the project depend on an unknown binary state. The principal can obtain more precise information about the state through a test at no cost, but crucially, it is common knowledge that she can falsify the test result. In the most interesting case where players have conflicted interests, the optimal test is a binary lemon-detecting test. We also find that coordination is possible when the principal is pessimistic but not when the agent is pessimistic. Moreover, when the agent has private information about the state, a single binary lemon-detecting test remains optimal even though the principal has the option to screen the agent by providing a menu of tests. Our finding is consistent with observed tests in real practice.</description>

      <title>Inverse Concave-Utility Reinforcement Learning is Inverse Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query and sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as Lipschitz-continuity. Finally, we outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</description>

      <title>Dependency equilibria: Boundary cases and their real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a significant step forward in understanding dependency equilibria within the framework of real algebraic geometry encompassing both pure and mixed equilibria. We start by breaking down the concept for a general audience, using concrete examples to illustrate the main results. In alignment with Spohn's original definition of dependency equilibria, we propose three alternative definitions, allowing for an algebro-geometric comprehensive study of all dependency equilibria. We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a pure dependency equilibrium and show that every Nash equilibrium lies on the Spohn variety, the algebraic model for dependency equilibria. For generic games, the set of real points of the Spohn variety is Zariski dense. Furthermore, every Nash equilibrium in this case is a dependency equilibrium. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the geometric structure of dependency equilibria for $(2\times2)$-games.</description>

      <title>Computational bounds on randomized algorithms for online bin stretching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A frequently studied performance measure in online optimization is competitive analysis. It corresponds to the worst-case ratio, over all possible inputs of an algorithm, between the performance of the algorithm and the optimal offline performance. However, this analysis may be too pessimistic to give valuable insight on a problem. Several workarounds exist, such as randomized algorithms. This paper aims to propose computational methods to construct randomized algorithms and to bound their performance on the classical online bin stretching problem. A game theory method is adapted to construct lower bounds on the performance of randomized online algorithms via linear programming. Another computational method is then proposed to construct randomized algorithms which perform better than the best deterministic algorithms known. Finally, another lower bound method for a restricted class of randomized algorithm for this problem is proposed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Matching Bandit For Two-Sided Online Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-sided online matching platforms are employed in various markets. However, agents' preferences in the current market are usually implicit and unknown, thus needing to be learned from data. With the growing availability of dynamic side information involved in the decision process, modern online matching methodology demands the capability to track shifting preferences for agents based on contextual information. This motivates us to propose a novel framework for this dynamic online matching problem with contextual information, which allows for dynamic preferences in matching decisions. Existing works focus on online matching with static preferences, but this is insufficient: the two-sided preference changes as soon as one side's contextual information updates, resulting in non-static matching. In this paper, we propose a dynamic matching bandit algorithm to adapt to this problem. The key component of the proposed dynamic matching algorithm is an online estimation of the preference ranking with a statistical guarantee. Theoretically, we show that the proposed dynamic matching algorithm delivers an agent-optimal stable matching result with high probability. In particular, we prove a logarithmic regret upper bound $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ and construct a corresponding instance-dependent matching regret lower bound. In the experiments, we demonstrate that dynamic matching algorithm is robust to various preference schemes, dimensions of contexts, reward noise levels, and context variation levels, and its application to a job-seeking market further demonstrates the practical usage of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Competing Matching Recommendation Markets With Quota and Complementary Preferences Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new recommendation algorithm for addressing the problem of two-sided online matching markets with complementary preferences and quota constraints, where agents' preferences are unknown a priori and must be learned from data. The presence of mixed quota and complementary preferences constraints can lead to instability in the matching process, making this problem challenging to solve. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the problem as a bandit learning framework and propose the Multi-agent Multi-type Thompson Sampling (MMTS) algorithm. The algorithm combines the strengths of Thompson Sampling for exploration with a new double matching technique to provide a stable matching outcome. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of MMTS as it can achieve stability and has a total $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(Q{\sqrt{K_{\max}T}})$-Bayesian regret with high probability, which exhibits linearity with respect to the total firm's quota $Q$, the square root of the maximum size of available type workers $\sqrt{K_{\max}}$ and time horizon $T$. In addition, simulation studies also demonstrate MMTS's effectiveness in various settings. We provide code used in our experiments \url{https://github.com/Likelyt/Double-Matching}.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>
