      <title>Enumeration of spanning trees and resistance distances of generalized blow-up graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a graph with vertex set $V(H)=\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_k\}$. The generalized blow-up graph $H_{p_1,\ldots,p_k}^{q_1,\ldots,q_k}$ is constructed by replacing each vertex $v_i \in V(H)$ with the graph $G_i = p_iK_t \cup q_iK_1$$(i=1,2,\cdots,k)$, then connecting all vertices between $G_i$ and $G_j$ whenever $v_iv_j \in E(H)$.
  In this paper, we enumerate the spanning trees in generalized blow-up graphs $H_{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_k}^{q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_k}$, which extends the results of Ge [Discrete Appl. Math. 305 (2021) 145-153], Cheng, Chen and Yan [Discrete Appl. Math. 320 (2022) 259-269]. Furthermore, we determine the resistance distances and Kirchhoff indices of generalized blow-up graphs $H_{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_k}^{q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_k}$, which extends the results of Sun, Yang and Xu [Discrete Math. 348 (2025) 114327], Xu and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 362 (2025) 18-33], Ni, Pan and Zhou [Discrete Appl. Math. 362 (2025) 100-108].</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study highest weight vectors for symmetric and alternating spaces of tensors, whose dimensions are given by generalized Kronecker coefficients. We present a unified explicit construction for corresponding spanning sets of highest weight vectors and completely describe the linear relations among them. We prove that these highest weight vectors satisfy a natural yet nontrivial duality. As applications, we also give conceptual interpretations to power expansions of Cayley's first hyperdeterminant and its dual exterior Cayley form.</description>

      <title>The Ehrhart polynomial of a matroid specializes to the beta invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the linear coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomial of a matroid base polytope evaluated at $t-1$ is equal to, up to normalization, the $\beta$-invariant of the matroid. This yields a lattice-point counting formula for the $\beta$-invariant and establishes a new and unexpected positivity property of Ehrhart polynomials of matroid polytopes.</description>

      <title>Hypertrees and their host trees: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,\mathcal{E})$ is a hypertree if it admits a tree $T$ with vertex set $V$ such that every edge of $\mathcal{H}$ induces a subtree of $T$. A tree like that is called a host tree. Several characterizations and properties of hypertrees have been discovered over the years. However, the interest in the structure of their host trees was weaker and restricted to particular scenarios where they arise, like the clique tree of chordal graphs. In that special case, the proofs of most characteristics of clique trees that exist in the literature rely significantly on the structural properties of chordal graphs. The purpose of this work is the study of the properties of the host trees of hypertrees in a more general context and have them described in a single place, giving simpler proofs for known facts, generalizing others and introducing some new concepts that the author considers that are relevant for the study of the topic. Particularly, we will determine what edges can be found in some host tree of a hypertree, and how these edges must be combined to form a host tree, with an emphasis in tools like the basis and the completion of a hypergraph, and the concept of equivalent hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Forcibly unicyclic and bicyclic graphic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $D=(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)$ of non-negative integers is called a graphic sequence if there is a simple graph with vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ such that the degree of $v_i$ is $d_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Given a graph theoretical property $\mathcal{P}$, a graphic sequence $D$ is forcibly $\mathcal{P}$ graphic if each graph with degree sequence $D$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. A graph is acyclic if it contains no cycles. A connected acyclic graph is just a tree and has $n-1$ edges. A graph of order $n$ is unicyclic (resp. bicyclic) if it is connected and has $n$ (resp. $n+1$) edges. Bar-Noy, B\"{o}hnlein, Peleg and Rawitz [Discrete Mathematics 346 (2023) 113460] characterized forcibly acyclic and forcibly connected acyclic graphic sequences. In this paper, we aim to characterize forcibly unicyclic and forcibly bicyclic graphic sequences.</description>

      <title>A study of two Ramsey numbers involving odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any two graphs $G$ and $H$, the \emph{Ramsey number} $R(G,H)$ is the minimum integer $n$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices either contains a copy of $G$ or its complement contains a copy of $H$ as a subgraph. The \emph{book graph} of order $(n+2)$ denoted by $B_{n}$ is the graph with $n$ distinct copies of triangles sharing a common edge called the `base'. A cycle of order $m$ is denoted by $C_{m}$. For any two positive integers $n$ and $m$, the value of $R(B_{n},C_{m})$ is still unknown, if $n\in [ \frac{9m}{8}-125, 4m-14]$. In this article, we have obtained a bound of $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$, if $n\in [2m-3, 4m-14]$ and $m\geq 7$ is an odd. This is an improvement on an earlier result. A connected graph $G$ is said to be \emph{$H$-good} if the formula, \begin{equation*} R(G,H)= (|G|-1)(\chi(H)-1)+\sigma(H) \end{equation*} holds, where $\chi(H)$ is the chromatic number of $H$ and $\sigma(H)$ is the size of the smallest colour class for the $\chi(H)$-colouring. In this article, we have studied the \emph{Ramsey goodness} of the graph pair $(C_{m}, \mathbb{K}_{2,n})$, where $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is the complete biparite graph. We have obtained an exact value of $R(\mathbb{K}_{2,n},C_{m})$, which shows that $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is $C_{m}$-good if $n\geq 2m+499$ is an integer and $m\geq 7$ is an odd integer. This extends a previous result on the Ramsey goodness of $(C_{m}, \mathbb{K}_{2,n})$.</description>

      <title>Laplacian eigenvalue distribution and girth of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices with girth $g$. Let $m_GI$ denote the number of Laplacian eigenvalues of graph $G$ in an interval $I$. In this paper, we show that $m_G(n-g+3,n]\leq n-g$. Moreover, we prove that $m_G(n-g+3,n]= n-g$ if and only if $G\cong K_{3,2}$ or $G\cong U_1$, where $U_1$ is obtained from a cycle by joining a single vertex with a vertex of this cycle.</description>

      <title>Construction of Butson matrices using Fourier matrices as input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Butson matrices are square orthogonal matrices, denoted by $BH(m,n)$, whose entries are the complex $m$th roots of unity and satisfy the condition\\ $BH(m,n)\cdot{BH(m,n)}^*=nI_n$, where ${BH(m,n)}^*$ is the conjugate transpose of $BH(m,n)$ and $I_n$ is the identity matrix. In this work, we propose constructions for $BH(m,(n-1)n)$ then $BH(m,(\frac{n}{2}-1)n)$, when $n$ and $m$ are even numbers, using the existing $BH(m,n)$. For each case, we provide two construction methods: one uses a single input Butson matrix, and another uses two input Butson matrices. Moreover, we present some results about the construction of Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>Contracting elements and conjugacy growth in Coxeter groups, graph products, and further groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we construct contracting elements in the standard Cayley graphs of the so-called periagroups, a family of groups introduced by the second-named author which include Coxeter groups, graph products, and Dyer groups. As a consequence, we deduce that, unless they virtually split as direct products, periagroups are acylindrically hyperbolic and their conjugacy growth series, with respect to standard generating sets, are transcendental.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $d, N \in \mathbb{N}$, we define $\mathfrak{C}_d(N)$ to be the number of pairs of $d\times d$ matrices $A,B$ with entries in $[-N,N] \cap \mathbb{Z}$ such that $AB = BA$. We prove that $$ N^{10} \ll \mathfrak{C}_3(N) \ll N^{10},$$ thus confirming a speculation of Browning-Sawin-Wang. We further establish that $$ \mathfrak{C}_2(N) = K(2N+1)^5 (1 + o(1)),$$ where $K&gt;0$ is an explicit constant. Our methods are completely elementary and rely on upper bounds of the correct order for restricted divisor correlations with high uniformity.</description>

      <title>Geometry of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lusztig varieties are subvarieties in flag manifolds $G/B$ associated to an element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ and an element $x$ in $G$, introduced in Lusztig's papers on character sheaves. We study the geometry of these varieties when $x$ is regular semisimple.
  In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure expected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the cohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary characteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has characteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we prove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and that their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in Deligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open since the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig.
  In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on their (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a Hessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with $w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig varieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations when they are smooth.
  This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat degeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. In particular, this proves a conjecture of Abreu and Nigro on the homeomorphism types of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties in type $A$, and generalizes it to arbitrary Lie types.</description>

      <title>Comparing Width Parameters on Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the relationship between non-equivalent width parameters changes once we restrict to some special graph class. As width parameters, we consider treewidth, clique-width, twin-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number, whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs and their common superclass, for $t \geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs.
  We first provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs.
  Next, we provide a complete comparison when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has bounded treewidth. This extends a result of Gurski and Wanke (2007) stating that a class of graphs ${\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class of line graphs of graphs in ${\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width.
  We then provide an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing case. Our main result is that $K_{t,t}$-free graphs of bounded mim-width have bounded tree-independence number. This result has structural and algorithmic consequences. In particular, it proves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and \v{S}torgel.
  Finally, we consider the question of whether boundedness of a certain width parameter is preserved under graph powers. We show that the question has a positive answer for sim-width precisely in the case of odd powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the smallest $\alpha$ so that $\alpha D + (1-\alpha)A \succcurlyeq 0$ is at least $1/\vartheta(\overline{G})$, significantly improving upon a result due to Nikiforov and Rojo (2017). In fact, we display an even stronger connection: if the nonzero entries of $A$ are allowed to vary and those of $D$ vary accordingly, then we show that this smallest $\alpha$ is in fact equal to $1/\vartheta(\overline{G})$. We also show other results obtained as an application of this optimization framework, including a connection to the well-known quadratic formulation for $\omega(G)$ due to Motzkin and Straus (1964).</description>

Abstract: This paper is the sequel of the paper under the same title with part 1, where we introduced refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials and their duals with two families of infinite parameters. In this paper we give combinatorial interpretations for these polynomials using generalizations of set-valued tableaux and reverse plane partitions, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2404.04246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials due to Lusztig and to Dyer, its parabolic analog due to Marietti, and a refined parabolic version that we introduce, are equivalent. We use this to give a new proof of Marietti's conjecture in the case of lower Bruhat intervals and to prove several new cases of the parabolic conjectures.</description>

      <title>Interlacing triangles, Schubert puzzles, and graph colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>Linear dependencies, polynomial factors in the Duke--Erd\H os forbidden sunflower problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a family of $s$ sets $\{F_1, \ldots, F_s\}$ a \textit{sunflower with $s$ petals} if, for any distinct $i, j \in [s]$, one has $F_i \cap F_j = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$. The set $C = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$ is called the {\it core} of the sunflower. It is a classical result of Erd\H os and Rado that there is a function $\phi(s,k)$ such that any family of $k$-element sets contains a sunflower with $s$ petals. In 1977, Duke and Erd\H os asked for the size of the largest family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ that contains no sunflower with $s$ petals and core of size $t-1$. In 1987, Frankl and F\" uredi asymptotically solved this problem for $k\ge 2t+1$ and $n&gt;n_0(s,k)$. This paper is one of the pinnacles of the so-called Delta-system method.
  In this paper, we extend the result of Frankl and F\"uredi to a much broader range of parameters: $n&gt;f_0(s,t) k$ with $f_0(s,t)$ polynomial in $s$ and $t$. We also extend this result to other domains, such as $[n]^k$ and ${n\choose k/w}^w$ and obtain even stronger and more general results for forbidden sunflowers with core at most $t-1$ (including results for families of permutations and subfamilies of the $k$-th layer in a simplicial complex).
  The methods of the paper, among other things, combine the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the first author, with the Delta-system approach of Frankl and F\"uredi and the hypercontractivity approach for global functions, developed by Keller, Lifshitz and coauthors. Previous works in extremal set theory relied on at most one of these methods. Creating such a unified approach was one of the goals for the paper.</description>

      <title>Functional tilings and the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are convex polytopes, which are the closure of a union of alcoves in an affine Coxeter arrangement. They are rational polytopes and, therefore, have Ehrhart quasipolynomials. Here we describe a method for computing the generating function of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial, or Ehrhart series, of any alcoved polytope via a particular shelling order of its alcoves. We also show a connection between Early's decorated ordered set partitions and this shelling order for the hypersimplex $\Delta_{2,n}$.</description>

      <title>On total transitivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say that $A$ \emph{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq k$. In this article, we study a variation of the transitive partition, namely the \emph{total transitive partition}. The total transitivity $Tr_t(G)$ is defined as the maximum order of a vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ obtained by repeatedly removing a total dominating set from $G$ until no vertices remain. Thus, $V_1$ is a total dominating set of $G$, $V_2$ is a total dominating set of the graph $G_1 = G - V_1$, and, for $2 \leq i \leq k - 1$, $V_{i+1}$ is a total dominating set in the graph $G_i = G - \bigcup_{j=1}^i V_j$. A vertex partition of order $Tr_t(G)$ is called a $Tr_t$-partition. The \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} is to find a total transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. First, we characterize split graphs with total transitivity equal to $1$ and $\omega(G) - 1$. Moreover, for a split graph $G$ and $1 \leq p \leq \omega(G) - 1$, we provide necessary conditions for $Tr_t(G) = p$. Furthermore, we show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for bipartite chain graphs. Finally, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} in trees.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Critical Multiplicity of Ramsey Numbers with Many Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the least integer $n$ such that any coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with two colors produces either a monochromatic $K_s$ in one color or a monochromatic $K_t$ in the other. If $s=t$, we say that the Ramsey number $R(s,s)$ is diagonal. The critical multiplicity of a diagonal Ramsey number $R(s,s)$, denoted $m(s,s)$ or $m_2(s)$, is the smallest number of copies of a monochromatic $K_s$ that can be found in any coloring of the edges of $K_{R(s,s)}$. For instance, $m_2(2)=1$, $m_2(3)=2$, and $m_2(4)=9$. In this short note, we produce some new upper bounds for the general non-diagonal case of $m(s_1,...,s_k)$ and improve the bounds on $m_2(s)$ for small $s$. This appears to be the first progress on bounding the critical multiplicity of Ramsey numbers since Piwakowski and Radziszowski's 2001 determination that $m_2(4)=9$, and we are not aware of any subsequent improvements on this quantity in the literature. We conclude by outlining a reasonably clear path to further improvements.</description>

      <title>The saturation number of wheels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $F$-free, if $G$ does not contain any copy of $F$. $G$ is said to be $F$-semi-saturated, if the addition of any nonedge $e \not \in E(G)$ would create a new copy of $F$ in $G+e$. $G$ is said to be $F$-saturated, if $G$ is $F$-free and $F$-semi-saturated. The saturation number $sat(n,F)$ (resp. semi-saturation number $ssat(n,F)$) is the minimum number of edges in an $F$-saturated (resp. $F$-semi-saturated) graph of order $n$. In this paper we proved several results on the (semi)-saturation number of the wheel graph $W_k=K_1 \vee C_k$. Let $k,n$ be positive integers with $k \geq 8$ and $n \geq 56k^3$, we showed that $(s)sat(n,W_k)=n-1+(s)sat(n-1,C_k)$. We also establish the lower bound of semi-saturation number of $W_k$ with restriction on maximum degree.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Lower Bound on the Chromatic Number using $p$-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_G $ be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $ G $, and let $ \chi(G) $, $ \chi_q(G) $, and $ \chi_f(G) $ denote its chromatic number, quantum chromatic number, and fractional chromatic number, respectively. For $ p \geq 0 $, we define the positive and negative $ p $-energies of $ G $ as $$ \mathcal{E}_p^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p, \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &lt; 0} |\lambda_i|^p, $$ where $ \lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n $ are the eigenvalues of $A_G $. We prove that for all $ p \geq 0 $, $$ \min\left\{\chi(G), \chi_q(G), \chi_f(G)\right\} \geq 1 + \max\left\{ \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)} \right\}^{\frac{1}{|p - 1|}}. $$ This result unifies and strengthens a series of existing bounds corresponding to the cases $ p \in \{0, 2, \infty\} $. In particular, the case $ p = 0 $ yields the inertia bound $$ \chi_f(G) \geq 1 + \max\left\{\frac{n^+}{n^-}, \frac{n^-}{n^+}\right\}, $$ where $ (n^+, n^0, n^-) $ is the inertia of $A_G $, thus resolving a conjecture of Elphick and Wocjan.
  We also demonstrate that for certain graphs, non-integer values of $ p $ provide sharper lower bounds than existing spectral bounds. As an example, we determine $ \chi_q(G) $ for the Tilley graph, which cannot be achieved using existing $ p $-energy bounds.</description>

      <title>Eigenspace embeddings of imprimitive association schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given symmetric association scheme $\mathcal{A}$ and its eigenspace $S_j$ there exists a mapping of vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ to unit vectors of $S_j$, known as the spherical representation of $\mathcal{A}$ in $S_j$, such that the inner products of these vectors only depend on the relation between the corresponding vertices; furthermore, these inner products only depend on the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$. We consider parameters of imprimitive association schemes listed as open cases in the list of parameters for quotient-polynomial graphs recently published by Herman and Maleki, and study embeddings of their substructures into some eigenspaces consistent with spherical representations of the putative association schemes. Using this, we obtain nonexistence for two parameter sets for $4$-class association schemes and one parameter sets for a $5$-class association scheme passing all previously known feasibility conditions, as well as uniqueness for two parameter sets for $5$-class association schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $t \in [-1, 1)$, a set of points on the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere is called $t$-almost equiangular if among any three distinct points there is a pair with inner product $t$. We propose a semidefinite programming upper bound for the maximum cardinality $\alpha(n, t)$ of such a set based on an extension of the Lov\'asz theta number to hypergraphs. This bound is at least as good as previously known bounds and for many values of $n$ and $t$ it is better.
  We also refine existing spectral methods to show that $\alpha(n, t) \leq 2(n+1)$ for all $n$ and $t \leq 0$, with equality only at $t = -1/n$. This allows us to show the uniqueness of the optimal construction at $t = -1/n$ for $n \leq 5$ and to enumerate all possible constructions for $n \leq 3$ and $t \leq 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated union-closed conjecture is concerned with the cardinalities of various subsets of the Boolean $d$-cube. The cardinality of such a set is equivalent, up to a constant, to its measure under the uniform distribution, so we can pose more general conjectures by choosing a different probability distribution on the cube. In particular, for any sequence of probabilities $(p_i)_{i=1}^d$ we can consider the product of $d$ independent Bernoulli random variables, with success probabilities $p_i$. In this short note, we find a generalised form of Karpas' special case of the union-closed conjecture for families $\mathcal{F}$ with density at least half. We also generalise Knill's logarithmic lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fork is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ (usually called claw) by subdividing an edge once. A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B]) &lt; \omega(H)$. In this paper, we prove that the perfect divisibility of fork-free graphs is equivalent to that of claw-free graphs. We also prove that, for $F\in \{P_7, P_6\cup K_1\}$, each (fork, $F$)-free graph $G$ is perfectly divisible and hence $\chi(G)\leq \binom{\omega(G)+1}{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We show that in any $d$-dimensional real normed space, unit balls can be packed with density at least \[\frac{(1-o(1))d\log d}{2^{d+1}},\] improving a result of Schmidt from 1958 by a logarithmic factor and generalizing the recent result of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen, and Sahasrabudhe in the $\ell_2$ norm. Our main tools are the graph-theoretic result used in the $\ell_2$ construction and volume bounds from convex geometry due to Petty and Schmuckenschl\"ager.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Sparse induced subgraphs in $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems, including e.g. Max Weight Independent Set, Feedback Vertex Set, or Vertex Planarization, can be unified under an umbrella of finding the largest sparse induced subgraph, that satisfies some property definable in CMSO$_2$ logic.
  It is believed that each problem expressible with this formalism can be solved in polynomial time in graphs that exclude a fixed path as an induced subgraph.
  This belief is supported by the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm by Gartland, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [STOC 2021], and a recent polynomial-time algorithm for $P_6$-free graphs by Chudnovsky, McCarty, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [SODA 2024].
  In this work we extend polynomial-time tractability of all such problems to $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of Generalized Abelian Complexity for Pisot Type Substitutive Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized abelian equivalence compares words by their factors up to a certain bounded length. The associated complexity function counts the equivalence classes for factors of a given size of an infinite sequence. How practical is this notion? When can these equivalence relations and complexity functions be computed efficiently? We study the fixed points of substitution of Pisot type. Each of their $k$-abelian complexities is bounded and the Parikh vectors of their length-$n$ prefixes form synchronized sequences in the associated Dumont--Thomas numeration system. Therefore, the $k$-abelian complexity of Pisot substitution fixed points is automatic in the same numeration system. Two effective generic construction approaches are investigated using the \texttt{Walnut} theorem prover and are applied to several examples. We obtain new properties of the Tribonacci sequence, such as a uniform bound for its factor balancedness together with a two-dimensional linear representation of its generalized abelian complexity functions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Laws for Extensions of First-Order Logic with Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many standard models of random structure, first-order logic sentences exhibit a convergence phenomenon on random inputs. The most well-known example is for random graphs with constant edge probability, where the probabilities of first-order sentences converge to 0 or 1. In other cases, such as certain ``sparse random graph'' models, the probabilities of sentences converge, although not necessarily to 0 or 1. In this work we deal with extensions of first-order logic with aggregate operators, variations of averaging. These logics will consist of real-valued terms, and we allow arbitrary Lipschitz functions to be used as ``connectives''. We show that some of the well-known convergence laws extend to this setting.</description>
