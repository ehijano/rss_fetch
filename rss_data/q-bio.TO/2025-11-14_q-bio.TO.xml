      <title>Diversity Over Scale: Whole-Slide Image Variety Enables H&amp;E Foundation Model Training with Fewer Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in computational pathology is increasingly driven by vision foundation models pretrained on vast histopathology datasets. While recent efforts have prioritized training on an ever-larger amount of patches, we take an alternative approach focused on data diversity. Our foundation model, Athena, was initialized from a pretrained model and trained on just 115 million tissue patches, several times fewer than recent histopathology foundation models. Rather than relying on patch volume or complex sampling heuristics, we maximize data diversity by randomly selecting only a moderate number of patches per whole-slide image from our diverse internal repository, which spans multiple countries, institutions, and scanner types. Evaluated on a single patch-level benchmark and four slide-level downstream tasks (two molecular and two morphological), Athena approaches the state-of-the-art and even surpasses several models trained on substantially larger datasets. This indicates that diversity across whole-slide images, rather than patch quantity alone, drives learning in histopathology foundation models.</description>

      <title>Histology-informed tiling of whole tissue sections improves the interpretability and predictability of cancer relapse and genetic alterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of menopause from deconvolution of millions of lab tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Menopause reshapes female physiology, yet its full temporal footprint is obscured by uncertainty in the age of the final menstrual period (FMP). Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image "de-blurring" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of metamodels for 0D cardiovascular models, and pipeline for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-dimensional (0D) cardiovascular models are reduced-order models used to study global circulation dynamics and transport. They provide estimates of biomarkers (such as pressure, flow rates, and concentrations) for surgery planning and boundary conditions for high-fidelity 3D models. Although their computational cost is low, tasks like parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification require many model evaluations, making them computationally expensive. This motivates building metamodels. In this work, we propose a pipeline from 0D models to metamodel building for tasks such as sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification. Three strategies are explored: Neural Networks, Polynomial Chaos Expansion, and Gaussian Processes, applied to three different 0D models. The first model predicts portal vein pressure after surgery, considering liver hemodynamics and global circulation. The second simulates whole-body circulation under pulmonary arterial hypertension before and after shunt insertion. The third assesses organ blood perfusion after revascularization surgery, focusing on contrast agent transport, requiring specific metamodel treatment. Metamodels are trained and tested on synthetic data. Neural networks proved the most efficient in terms of result quality, computational time, and ease for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we demonstrate the full pipeline with a neural network as the emulator.</description>
