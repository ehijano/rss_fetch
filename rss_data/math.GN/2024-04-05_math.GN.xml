      <title>On the Theoretical Expressive Power and the Design Space of Higher-Order Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph transformers have recently received significant attention in graph learning, partly due to their ability to capture more global interaction via self-attention. Nevertheless, while higher-order graph neural networks have been reasonably well studied, the exploration of extending graph transformers to higher-order variants is just starting. Both theoretical understanding and empirical results are limited. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of the theoretical expressive power of order-$k$ graph transformers and sparse variants. We first show that, an order-$k$ graph transformer without additional structural information is less expressive than the $k$-Weisfeiler Lehman ($k$-WL) test despite its high computational cost. We then explore strategies to both sparsify and enhance the higher-order graph transformers, aiming to improve both their efficiency and expressiveness. Indeed, sparsification based on neighborhood information can enhance the expressive power, as it provides additional information about input graph structures. In particular, we show that a natural neighborhood-based sparse order-$k$ transformer model is not only computationally efficient, but also expressive -- as expressive as $k$-WL test. We further study several other sparse graph attention models that are computationally efficient and provide their expressiveness analysis. Finally, we provide experimental results to show the effectiveness of the different sparsification strategies.</description>

      <title>Chain union closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spherical completeness of ball spaces and its stability under expansions. We give some criteria for ball spaces that guarantee that spherical completeness is preserved when the ball space is closed under unions of chains. This applies in particular to the spaces of closed ultrametric balls in ultrametric spaces with linearly ordered value sets, or more generally, with countable narrow value sets. We show that in general, chain union closures of ultrametric spaces with partially ordered value sets do not preserve spherical completeness. Further, we introduce and study the notions of chain union stability and of chain union rank, which measure how often the process of closing a ball space under all unions of chains has to be iterated until a ball space is obtained that is closed under unions of chains.</description>

      <title>Topological spaces satisfying a closed graph theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss topological versions of the closed graph theorem, where continuity is inferred from near continuity in tandem with suitable conditions on source or target spaces. We seek internal characterizations of spaces satisfying a closed graph theorem, and we compare closed graph and open mapping spaces.</description>
