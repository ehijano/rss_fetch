      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds Parameter Estimation in Pulsar Timing Arrays with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are essential tools for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), but their analysis faces significant computational challenges. Traditional methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces where noise parameters often dominate, while existing deep learning approaches fail to model the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation or are validated only on synthetic datasets. We propose a flow-matching-based continuous normalizing flow (CNF) for efficient and accurate PTA parameter estimation. By focusing on the 10 most contributive pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, our method achieves posteriors consistent with MCMC, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence below \(10^{-2}\) nat, while reducing sampling time from 50 hours to 4 minutes. Powered by a versatile embedding network and a reweighting loss function, our approach prioritizes the SGWB parameters and scales effectively for future datasets. It enables precise reconstruction of SGWB and opens new avenues for exploring vast observational data and uncovering potential new physics, offering a transformative tool for advancing gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are crucial for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. We present a proton flux measurement method based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and machine learning techniques. After preprocessing the NM data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simulate the relationship between the NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02). We obtain daily proton flux data ranging from 1GV to 100GV for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing that the measured values are in good agreement with the observed ones. In particular, we provide daily proton flux measurements for periods when AMS-02 data are unavailable due to operational reasons. We also perform wavelet analyses on the continuous proton flux data to investigate the relationship between proton flux and solar activity variations, particularly during late 2014 when AMS-02 measurements were missing.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

      <title>Position reconstruction using deep learning for the HERD PSD beam test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is a dedicated high energy astronomy and particle physics experiment planned to be installed on the Chinese space station, aiming to detect high-energy cosmic rays (GeV $\sim$ PeV) and high-energy gamma rays ($&gt;$ 500 MeV). The Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) is one of the sub-detectors of HERD, with its main function of providing real-time anti-conincidence signals for gamma-ray detection and the secondary function of measuring the charge of cosmic-rays. In 2023, a prototype of PSD was developed and tested at CERN PS&amp;SPS. In this paper, we investigate the position response of the PSD using two reconstruction algorithms: the classic dual-readout ratio and the deep learning method (KAN &amp; MLP neural network). With the latter, we achieved a position resolution of 2 mm (1$\sigma$), which is significantly better than the classic method.</description>

      <title>Computing Classical Orbital Elements with Improved Efficiency and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to the implementation to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a simple and robust way. It presents two coding strategies that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>
