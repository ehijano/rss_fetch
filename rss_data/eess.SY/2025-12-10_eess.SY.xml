      <title>Sensor Attack Detection Method for Encrypted State Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an encrypted state observer that is capable of detecting sensor attacks without decryption. We first design a state observer that operates over a finite field of integers with the modular arithmetic. The observer generates a residue signal that indicates the presence of attacks under sparse attack and sensing redundancy conditions. Then, we develop a homomorphic encryption scheme that enables the observer to operate over encrypted data while automatically disclosing the residue signal. Unlike our previous work restricted to single-input single-output systems, the proposed scheme is applicable to general multi-input multi-output systems. Given that the disclosed residue signal remains below a prescribed threshold, the full state can be recovered as an encrypted message.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics from Infrequent Output Measurements for Uncertainty-Aware Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable optimal control is challenging when the dynamics of a nonlinear system are unknown and only infrequent, noisy output measurements are available. This work addresses this setting of limited sensing by formulating a Bayesian prior over the continuous-time dynamics and latent state trajectory in state-space form and updating it through a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler equipped with a numerical ODE integrator. The resulting posterior samples are used to formulate a scenario-based optimal control problem that accounts for both model and measurement uncertainty and is solved using standard nonlinear programming methods. The approach is validated in a numerical case study on glucose regulation using a Type 1 diabetes model.</description>

      <title>Cabin Layout, Seat Density, and Passenger Segmentation in Air Transport: Implications for Prices, Ancillary Revenues, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and density of seats in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Datacenter Demand Ramping and Fluctuation using Hybrid ESS and Supercapacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Coding Scheme to Prevent Covert Cyber-Attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two main problems in the context of covert cyber-attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS). First, we aim to investigate and develop necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of disruption resources of the CPS that enable adversaries to execute covert cyber-attacks. These conditions can be utilized to identify the input and output communication channels that are needed by adversaries to execute these attacks. Second, this paper introduces and develops a dynamic coding scheme as a countermeasure against covert cyber-attacks. Under certain conditions and assuming the existence of one secure input and two secure output communication channels, the proposed dynamic coding scheme prevents adversaries from executing covert cyber-attacks. A numerical case study of a flight control system is provided to demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed and developed dynamic coding scheme.</description>

      <title>Integrating Delay-Absorption Capability into Flight Departure Delay Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting flight departure delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and mitigating the cascading disruptions that propagate through tightly coupled aircraft rotations. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat upstream delays as static variables, overlooking the dynamic recovery processes that determine whether a delay is absorbed or transmitted to subsequent legs. This study introduces a two-stage machine learning framework that explicitly models delay-absorption behavior and incorporates it into downstream delay prediction. In Stage I, a CatBoost classifier estimates the probability that a flight successfully absorbs an upstream delay based on operational, temporal, and meteorological features. This probability, termed AbsorbScore, quantifies airport- and flight-specific resilience to delay propagation. In Stage II, an XGBoost classifier integrates AbsorbScore with schedule, weather, and congestion indicators to predict whether a flight will depart more than 15 minutes late. Using U.S. domestic flight and NOAA weather data from Summer 2023, the proposed framework achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, increasing ROC-AUC from 0.865 to 0.898 and enhancing precision to 89.2% in identifying delayed flights. The results demonstrate that modeling delay absorption as an intermediate mechanism significantly improves predictive performance and yields interpretable insights into airport recovery dynamics, offering a practical foundation for data-driven delay management and proactive operational planning.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Minimal Current Harmonic Distortion in Optimal Modulation of Single-Phase Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs</description>

      <title>Theoretical Studies of Sub-THz Active Split-Ring Resonators for Near-Field Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for the design of Active Split-Ring Resonators (ASRRs). An ASRR is a Split-Ring Resonator (SRR) equipped with a tunable negative resistor, enabling both switchability and quality factor boosting and tuning. These properties make ASRRs well-suited for integration into dense arrays on silicon chips, where pixelated near-fields are generated and leveraged for high-resolution 2D imaging of samples. Such imagers pave the way for real-time, non-invasive, and low-cost imaging of human body tissue. The paper investigates ASRR coupling to host transmission lines, nonlinear effects, signal flow, and the influence of various noise sources on detection performance. Verified through simulations, these studies provide design guidelines for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and power consumption of a single pixel, while adhering to the constraints of a scalable array.</description>

      <title>Formation and Investigation of Cooperative Platooning at the Early Stage of Connected and Automated Vehicles Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative platooning, enabled by cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), is a cornerstone technology for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), offering significant improvements in safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency over traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI into CAD systems transforms how engineers plan and develop infrastructure projects involving water and power transportation across industrial and remote landscapes. This paper discusses how AI-driven CAD systems improve the efficient, effective, and sustainable design of infrastructure by embedding automation, predictive modeling, and real-time data analytics. This study examines how AI-supported toolsets can enhance design workflows, minimize human error, and optimize resource allocation for projects in underdeveloped environments. It also addresses technical and organizational challenges to AI adoption, including data silos, interoperability issues, and workforce adaptation. The findings demonstrate that AI-powered CAD enables faster project delivery, enhanced design precision, and increased resilience to environmental and logistical constraints. AI helps connect CAD, GIS, and IoT technologies to develop self-learning, adaptive design systems that are needed to meet the increasing global demand for sustainable infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wave Variables: A Data-Driven Ensemble Approach for Enhanced Teleoperation Transparency and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delays in communication channels present significant challenges for bilateral teleoperation systems, affecting both transparency and stability. Although traditional wave variable-based methods for a four-channel architecture ensure stability via passivity, they remain vulnerable to wave reflections and disturbances like variable delays and environmental noise. This article presents a data-driven hybrid framework that replaces the conventional wave-variable transform with an ensemble of three advanced sequence models, each optimized separately via the state-of-the-art Optuna optimizer, and combined through a stacking meta-learner. The base predictors include an LSTM augmented with Prophet for trend correction, an LSTM-based feature extractor paired with clustering and a random forest for improved regression, and a CNN-LSTM model for localized and long-term dynamics. Experimental validation was performed in Python using data generated from the baseline system implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that our optimized ensemble achieves a transparency comparable to the baseline wave-variable system under varying delays and noise, while ensuring stability through passivity constraints.</description>

      <title>MPC for tracking for anesthesia dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an MPC for tracking formulation is proposed for the control of anesthesia dynamics. It seamlessly enables the optimization of the steady-states pair that is not unique due to the MISO nature of the model. Anesthesia dynamics is a multi-time scale system with two types of states characterized, respectively, by fast and slow dynamics. In anesthesia control, the output equation depends only on the fast dynamics. Therefore, the slow states can be treated as disturbances, and compensation terms can be introduced. Subsequently, the system can be reformulated as a nominal one allowing the design of an MPC for tracking strategy. The presented framework ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability, through the design of appropriate terminal ingredients in the MPC for tracking framework. The controller performance is then assessed on a patient in a simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Quantization and Security Parameter Design for Overflow-Free Confidential FRIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a systematic design procedure for determining the quantization gain and the security parameter in the Confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (CFRIT), enabling overflow-free and accuracy-guaranteed encrypted controller tuning. Within an encrypted data-driven gain tuning, the range of quantization errors induced during the encoding (encryption) process can be estimated from operational data. Based on this insight, explicit analytical conditions on the quantization gain and the security parameter are derived to prevent overflow in computing over encrypted data. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a quantitative relationship between quantization-induced errors and the deviation between the gains obtained by CFRIT and non-confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT), clarifying how parameter choice affects tuning accuracy. A numerical example verifies the proposed procedure by demonstrating that the designed parameters achieve accurate encrypted tuning within a prescribed tolerance while preventing overflow. In addition, the admissible region of parameter combinations is visualized to examine the characteristics of feasible and infeasible regions, providing practical insights into parameter design for encrypted data-driven control.</description>

      <title>High-performance computing enabled contingency analysis for modern power networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Behavioral-Feedback SIR Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a behavioral-feedback SIR epidemic model, in which the infection rate depends in feedback on the fractions of susceptible and infected agents, respectively. The considered model allows one to account for endogenous adaptation mechanisms of the agents in response to the epidemics, such as voluntary social distancing, or the adoption of face masks. For this model, we formulate an optimal control problem for a social planner that has the ability to reduce the infection rate to keep the infection curve below a certain threshold within an infinite time horizon, while minimizing the intervention cost. Based on the dynamic properties of the model, we prove that, under quite general conditions on the infection rate, the \emph{filling the box} strategy is the optimal control. This strategy consists in letting the epidemics spread without intervention until the threshold is reached, then applying the minimum control that leaves the fraction of infected individuals constantly at the threshold until the reproduction number becomes less than one and the infection naturally fades out. Our result generalizes one available in the literature for the equivalent problem formulated for the classical SIR model, which can be recovered as a special case of our model when the infection rate is constant. Our contribution enhances the understanding of epidemic management with adaptive human behavior, offering insights for robust containment strategies.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Design of Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions via Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a systematic method for designing time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBF) composed of a time-invariant component and multiple time-dependent components, leveraging structural properties of the system dynamics. The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>NLoS Localization with Single Base Station Based on Radio Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate outdoor localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge for wireless communication and sensing systems. Existing methods, including positioning based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and triple Base Stations (BSs) techniques, cannot provide reliable performance under NLoS conditions, particularly in dense urban areas with strong multipath effects. To address this limitation, we propose a single BS localization framework that integrates sequential signal measurements with prior radio information embedded in the Radio Map (RM). Using temporal measurement features and matching them with radio maps, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse impact of multipath propagation and reduces the dependence on LoS paths. Simulation experiments further evaluate the impact of different radio map construction strategies and the varying lengths of the measurement sequence on localization accuracy. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in typical NLoS environments, highlighting its potential as a practical and robust solution for single-base-station deployment.</description>

      <title>Direct transfer of optimized controllers to similar systems using dimensionless MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled model experiments are commonly used in various engineering fields to reduce experimentation costs and overcome constraints associated with full-scale systems. The relevance of such experiments relies on dimensional analysis and the principle of dynamic similarity. However, transferring controllers to full-scale systems often requires additional tuning. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a direct controller transfer using dimensionless model predictive control, tuned automatically for closed-loop performance. With this reformulation, the closed-loop behavior of an optimized controller transfers directly to a new, dynamically similar system. Additionally, the dimensionless formulation allows for the use of data from systems of different scales during parameter optimization. We demonstrate the method on a cartpole swing-up and a car racing problem, applying either reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization for tuning the controller parameters. Software used to obtain the results in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/josipkh/dimensionless-mpcrl.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Informed Monte Carlo Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.</description>

      <title>LaMoSys3.5D: Enabling 3.5D-IC-Based Large Language Model Inference Serving Systems via Hardware/Software Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models LLMs amplifies the need for highthroughput energyefficient inference at scale. 3DDRAMbased accelerators provide high memory bandwidth and therefore an opportunity to accelerate the bandwidthbound decode phase. However, how to adequately balance compute density for prefill with bandwidthcapacity for decode remains open. Moreover, most prior designs do not target endtoend serving, leaving the codesign of dataflow, parallel mapping, and scheduling underexplored. To bridge the gap, we present LaMoSys3.5D, to our knowledge the first scalable 3.5DIC architecture for LLM serving. LaMoSys3.5D composes heterogeneous 3DDRAM chiplets on a 2.5D interposer: computerich chiplets for prefill and bandwidthcapacityrich chiplets for decode. To realize efficient serving, we adopt a hardwaresoftware codesign spanning dataflow, parallel mapping, and introduce a thermalaware modeling and hierarchical designspace exploration framework. Across diverse LLMs and workloads, LaMoSys3.5D improves throughputperwatt over DGXA100 systems by 62 and achieves a 4.87 better endtoend latency geomean versus prior 3D designs. We further distill intriguing design guidelines for 3.5DIC architectures and endtoend inference serving.</description>

      <title>IoT-based Cost-Effective Fruit Quality Monitoring System using Electronic Nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-harvest losses due to subjective quality assessment cause significant damage to the economy and food safety, especially in countries like Bangladesh. To mitigate such damages, objective decision-making backed by scientific methods is necessary. An IoT-based, cost-effective quality monitoring system can provide a solution by going beyond subjective quality monitoring and decision-making practices. Here, we propose a low-power, cost-effective fruit quality monitoring system with an array of MQ gas sensors, which can be used as an electronic nose. We track the volatile gas emissions, specifically ethanol, methane, and ammonia, encompassing both ripening and decomposition for a set of bananas. Based on the gas concentration thresholds, we develop a mathematical model to accurately assess fruit quality. We also integrate this information into a dashboard for prompt decision-making and monitoring to make it useful to the farmers. This approach has the potential to reduce economic losses, enhance food safety, and provide scalable solutions for the supply chain.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Tightly-Coupled Observer Design for Single-Range-Aided Inertial Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a single-range-aided navigation observer that reconstructs the full state of a rigid body using only an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a body-frame vector measurement (e.g., magnetometer), and a distance measurement from a fixed anchor point. The design first formulates an extended linear time-varying (LTV) system to estimate body-frame position, body-frame velocity, and the gravity direction. The recovered gravity direction, combined with the body-frame vector measurement, is then used to reconstruct the full orientation on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, resulting in a cascaded observer architecture. Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) of the cascaded design is established under a uniform observability condition, ensuring robustness to sensor noise and trajectory variations. Simulation studies on three-dimensional trajectories demonstrate accurate estimation of position, velocity, and orientation, highlighting single-range aiding as a lightweight and effective modality for autonomous navigation.</description>

      <title>Signal and Noise Classification in Bio-Signals via unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world biosignal data is frequently corrupted by various types of noise, such as motion artifacts, and baseline wander. Although digital signal processing techniques exist to process such signals; however, heavily degraded signals cannot be recovered. In this study, we aim to classify two things: first, a binary classification of noisy and clean biosignals, and next, to categorize various kinds of noise such as motion artifacts, sensor failure, etc. We implemented K-means clustering, and our results indicate that the algorithm can most reliably group clean segments from noisy ones, particularly strong performance in identifying clean data compared to various categories of noise. This approach enables the selection of only high-quality bio-signal segments and provides accurate results for feature engineering that may enhance the precision of machine learning models trained on biosignals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint activity describes when more than one agent (human or machine) contributes to the completion of a task or activity. Designing for joint activity focuses on explicitly supporting the interdependencies between agents necessary for effective coordination among agents engaged in the joint activity. This builds and expands upon designing for usability to further address how technologies can be designed to act as effective team players. Effective joint activity requires supporting, at minimum, five primary macrocognitive functions within teams: Event Detection, Sensemaking, Adaptability, Perspective-Shifting, and Coordination. Supporting these functions is equally as important as making technologies usable. We synthesized fourteen heuristics from relevant literature including display design, human factors, cognitive systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science to aid the design, development, and evaluation of technologies that support joint human-machine activity.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline decision-making requires synthesizing reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without further interaction, yet existing generative approaches often yield trajectories that are dynamically infeasible. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Finally, we deploy our method on a real quadrupedal robot, showcasing its practicality for real-world control.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Transformations and the Analytic--Geometric Reconstruction of the Induction--Machine Circle Diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heyland circle diagram is a classical graphical method for representing the steady--state behavior of induction machines using no--load and blocked--rotor test data. Despite its long pedagogical history, the traditional geometric construction has not been formalized within a closed analytic framework. This note develops a complete Euclidean reconstruction of the diagram using only the two measured phasors and elementary geometric operations, yielding a unique circle, a torque chord, a slip scale, and a maximum--torque point. We prove that this constructed circle coincides precisely with the analytic steady--state current locus obtained from the per--phase equivalent circuit. A M\"obius transformation interpretation reveals the complex--analytic origin of the diagram's circularity and offers a compact explanation of its geometric structure.</description>

      <title>Using reinforcement learning to probe the role of feedback in skill acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.</description>

      <title>The SMART+ Framework for AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are now an integral part of multiple industries. In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy &amp; Security, Data Governance, Fairness &amp; Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research.</description>

      <title>Saturation-based robustly optimal hierarchical operation control of microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of robustly optimal operation control of microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. The main goal is to ensure optimal operation under a wide range of circumstances, given the highly intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable sources and load demand. We formally state this problem, and, in order to solve it, we make effective use of the hierarchical power system control approach. We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework. Finally, a case study demonstrates the viability of the control design.</description>

      <title>Fast Switching in Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deduce stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control with a downstream oversampling phase. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness of model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We deduce nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility on an oversampling time grid. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments illustrate practical relevance of fast control switching.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacecraft must operate under environmental and actuator uncertainties while meeting strict safety requirements. Traditional approaches rely on scenario-based heuristics that fail to account for stochastic influences, leading to suboptimal or unsafe plans. We propose a finite-horizon, chance-constrained Markov decision process for mission planning, where states represent mission and vehicle parameters, actions correspond to operational adjustments, and temporal logic specifications encode operational reach-avoid constraints. We synthesize policies that optimize mission objectives while ensuring constraints are met with high probability. Applied to the GRACE-FO mission, the approach accounts for stochastic solar activity and uncertain thrust performance, yielding maneuver schedules that maximize scientific return and provably satisfy safety requirements. We demonstrate how Markov decision processes can be applied to space missions, enabling autonomous operation with formal guarantees.</description>

      <title>Online Energy Storage Arbitrage under Imperfect Predictions: A Conformal Risk-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risk arising from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate - based on the theory of upper-C1 functions - the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. In particular, we prove that the sequential quadratic programming algorithm converges to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points, and that such conditions are satisfied by any subgradient at a local minimum. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. From a practical point of view, we combine the local exploitation proposed above with a global exploration using either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization. We show that the proposed constrained optimization effectively complements Monte-Carlo sampling by enabling fast detection of rare worst-case configurations, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations.</description>

Abstract: The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community. This competition will be hosted at the 4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026. This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: "Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."
  The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages. For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence. The solutions will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable open-source evaluation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a symmetry-based framework for formation control on cycle graphs using Dihedral point-group constraints. We show that enforcing inter-agent reflection symmetries, together with anchoring a single designated agent to its prescribed mirror axis, is sufficient to realize every $\mathcal{C}_{nv}$-symmetric configuration using only $n-1$ communication links. The resulting control laws have a matrix-weighted Laplacian structure and guarantee exponential convergence to the desired symmetric configuration. Furthermore, we extend the method to enable coordinated maneuvers along a time-varying reference trajectory. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Avoidance of UAV in Dynamic Environments Using Direction and Velocity-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $\omega(\theta,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers. The system ensures superior path integrity and reliable performance, confirming its viability for autonomous navigation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of 3D rotations poses well-known challenges in generalizing planar problems to three-dimensional ones, even more so in contact-rich tasks where haptic information (i.e., forces/torques) is involved. In this sense, not all learning-based algorithms that are currently available generalize to 3D orientation estimation. Non-linear filters defined on $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$ are widely used with inertial measurement sensors; however, none of them have been used with haptic measurements. This paper presents a unique complementary filtering framework that interprets the geometric shape of objects in the form of superquadrics, exploits the symmetry of $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$, and uses force and vision sensors as measurements to provide an estimate of orientation. The framework's robustness and almost global stability are substantiated by a set of experiments on a dual-arm robotic setup.</description>

      <title>Beyond Formal Semantics for Capabilities and Skills: Model Context Protocol in Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies, Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven production systems.</description>

      <title>TenonOS: A Self-Generating LibOS-on-LibOS Framework for Time-Critical Embedded Operating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of embedded systems creates tension between rich functionality and strict resource and real-time constraints. Traditional monolithic operating system and hypervisor designs suffer from resource bloat and unpredictable scheduling, making them unsuitable for time-critical workloads where low latency and low jitter are essential. We propose TenonOS, a demand-driven, self-generating, lightweight operating system framework for time-critical embedded systems that rethinks both hypervisor and operating system architectures. TenonOS introduces a LibOS-on-LibOS model that decomposes hypervisor and operating system functionality into fine-grained, reusable micro-libraries. A generative orchestration engine dynamically composes these libraries to synthesize a customized runtime tailored to each application's criticality, timing requirements, and resource profile. TenonOS consists of two core components: Mortise, a minimalist micro-hypervisor, and Tenon, a real-time library operating system. Mortise provides lightweight isolation and removes the usual double-scheduler overhead in virtualized setups, while Tenon provides precise and deterministic task management. By generating only the necessary software stack per workload, TenonOS removes redundant layers, minimizes the trusted computing base, and maximizes responsiveness. Experiments show a 40.28 percent reduction in scheduling latency, an ultra-compact 361 KiB memory footprint, and strong adaptability.</description>

      <title>Unifying Entropy Regularization in Optimal Control: From and Back to Classical Objectives via Iterated Soft Policies and Path Integral Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified perspective on several stochastic optimal control formulations through the lens of Kullback-Leibler regularization. We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems.</description>
