      <title>Optimally stopping multidimensional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve optimal stopping for multidimensional Brownian motion in a bounded domain, a question raised in Dynkin and Yushkevich (1967), where the one-dimensional case was presented. Taking a geometric approach, under regularity conditions we construct the optimal stopping free boundary in the multidimensional case. We characterise the value function as the pointwise infimum of potentials with recursive extensions dominating the gain function, and obtain its continuity. Explicit examples illustrate the result.</description>

      <title>Density Frankl-R\"{o}dl on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a density variant of the Frankl-R\"{o}dl theorem on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, which concerns avoiding pairs of vectors with a specific distance, or equivalently, a prescribed inner product. In particular, we establish lower bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen pair of such vectors lies entirely within a measurable subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ of sufficiently large measure. Additionally, we prove a density version of spherical avoidance problems, which generalize from pairwise avoidance to broader configurations with prescribed pairwise inner products. Our framework encompasses a class of configurations we call inductive configurations, which include simplices with any prescribed inner product $-1 &lt; r &lt; 1$. As a consequence of our density statement, we show that all inductive configurations are sphere Ramsey.</description>

      <title>Results related to the Gaussian product inequality conjecture for mixed-sign exponents in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note establishes that the opposite Gaussian product inequality (GPI) of the type proved by Russell &amp; Sun (2022a) in two dimensions, and partially extended to higher dimensions by Zhou et al. (2024), continues to hold for an arbitrary mix of positive and negative exponents. A general quantitative lower bound is also obtained conditionally on the GPI conjecture being true.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary nonzero-sum Markov games under a probability criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with N-person nonzero-sum discrete-time Markov games under a probability criterion, in which the transition probabilities and reward functions are allowed to vary with time. Differing from the existing works on the expected reward criteria, our concern here is to maximize the probabilities that the accumulated rewards until the first passage time to any target set exceed a given goal, which represent the reliability of the players income. Under a mild condition, by developing a comparison theorem for the probability criterion, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium over history-dependent policies. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm for computing epsilon-Nash equilibria. Finally, we illustrate our main results by a nonstationary energy management model and take a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>From Combinatorics to Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal matching of point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a combinatorial problem; applications in statistics motivate to consider random point clouds, like the Poisson point process. There is a crucial dependance on dimension $d$, with $d=2$ being the critical dimension. This is revealed by adopting an analytical perspective, connecting e.\,g.~to Optimal Transportation. These short notes provide an introduction to the subject. The material presented here is based on a series of lectures held at the International Max Planck Research School during the summer semester 2022. Recordings of the lectures are available at https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/event/imprs-ringvorlesung-summer-semester-2022.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak convergence rates for fully coupled multiscale stochastic differential equations driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first establish strong convergence rates for multiscale systems driven by $\alpha$-stable processes, with analyses constructed in two distinct scaling regimes. When addressing weak convergence rates of this system, we derive four averaged equations with respect to four scaling regimes. Notably, under sufficient H\"{o}lder regularity conditions on the time-dependent drifts of slow process, the strong convergence orders are related to the known optimal strong convergence order $1-\frac{1}{\alpha}$, and the weak convergence orders are 1. Our primary approach involves employing nonlocal Poisson equations to construct ``corrector equations" that effectively eliminate inhomogeneous terms.</description>

      <title>Stochastic oscillators out of equilibrium: scaling limits and correlation estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a purely harmonic chain of oscillators which is perturbed by a stochastic noise. Under this perturbation, the system exhibits two conserved quantities: the volume and the energy. At the level of the hydrodynamic limit, under diffusive scaling, we show that depending on the strength of the Hamiltonian dynamics, energy and volume evolve according to either a system of autonomous heat equations or a non-linear system of coupled parabolic equations. Moreover, for general initial measures, under diffusive scaling, we can characterize the non-equilibrium volume fluctuations. The proofs are based on precise bounds on the two-point volume correlation function and a uniform fourth-moment estimate.</description>

      <title>Separating balls with partly random hyperplanes with a view to partly random neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact expressions for the probabilities that partly random hyperplanes separate two Euclidean balls. The probability that a fully random hyperplane separates two balls turns out to be significantly smaller than the corresponding probabilities for hyperplanes which are not fully random in certain cases. Our results motivate studying partially random neural networks and provide a first step in this direction.</description>

      <title>Spectra of contractions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Tensor Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the spectra of matrix-valued contractions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Tensor Ensemble (GOTE). Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote a random tensor of order $r$ and dimension $n$ drawn from the density \[
  f(\mathcal{G}) \propto \exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2r}\|\mathcal{G}\|^2_{\mathrm{F}}\bigg). \] For $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$, the unit-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the matrix-valued contraction $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ when both $r$ and $n$ go to infinity such that $r / n \to c \in [0, \infty]$. We obtain semi-circle bulk-limits in all regimes, generalising the works of Goulart et al. (2022); Au and Garza-Vargas (2023); Bonnin (2024) in the fixed-$r$ setting.
  We also study the edge-spectrum. We obtain a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'{e}ch\'{e} phase-transition for the largest and the smallest eigenvalues at $r = 4$, generalising a result of Mukherjee et al. (2024) in the context of adjacency matrices of random hypergraphs. We also show that the extreme eigenvectors of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ contain non-trivial information about the contraction direction $\mathbf{w}$.
  Finally, we report some results, in the case $r = 4$, on mixed contractions $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$. While the total variation distance between the joint distribution of the entries of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ and that of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}$ goes to $0$ when $\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = o(n^{-1})$, the bulk and the largest eigenvalues of these two matrices have the same limit profile as long as $\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = o(1)$. Furthermore, it turns out that there are no outlier eigenvalues in the spectrum of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ when $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = o(1)$.</description>

      <title>On Unbiased Low-Rank Approximation with Minimum Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best approximates a fixed target matrix $P\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ in the following sense: $Q$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q] = P$; $\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient unbiased sparsification problem for vectors, except applied to the singular components of the matrix $P$. Optimality is proven by showing that our algorithm matches the error from an existing lower bound.</description>

      <title>Information Spreading in Random Graphs Evoving by Norros-Reittu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the spreading of a message within the random graph evolving by the Norros-Reittu preferential attachment model. The latter model forms random Poissonian numbers of edges between newly added nodes and existing ones. For a pre-fixed time $T^*$, the probability mass functions of the number of nodes obtained the message and the total number of nodes in the graph, as well as the distribution function of their ratio are derived. To this end, the success probability to disseminate the message from the node with the message to the node without message is proved. The exposition is illustrated by the simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees which are metric spaces locally isometric to real trees. Such spaces are equipped with a Radon measure satisfying a locally uniform volume growth condition. Using the intrinsic geodesic structure, we define weak gradients and develop from it a coherent theory of Sobolev and BV spaces. We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>SIR Epidemics on Evolving Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard SIR model, infected vertices infect their neighbors at rate $\lambda$ independently across each edge. They also recover at rate $\gamma$. In this work we consider the SIR-$\omega$ model where the graph structure itself co-evolves with the SIR dynamics. Specifically, $S-I$ connections are broken at rate $\omega$. Then, with probability $\alpha$, $S$ rewires this edge to another uniformly chosen vertex; and with probability $1-\alpha$, this edge is simply dropped. When $\alpha=1$ the SIR-$\omega$ model becomes the evoSIR model. Jiang et al. proved in \cite{DOMath} that the probability of an outbreak in the evoSIR model converges to 0 as $\lambda$ approaches the critical infection rate $\lambda_c$. On the other hand, numerical experiments in \cite{DOMath} revealed that, as $\lambda \to \lambda_c$, (conditionally on an outbreak) the fraction of infected vertices may not converge to 0, which is referred to as a discontinuous phase transition. In \cite{BB} Ball and Britton give two (non-matching) conditions for continuous and discontinuous phase transitions for the fraction of infected vertices in the SIR-$\omega$ model. In this work, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of a discontinuous phase transition of the final epidemic size of the SIR-$\omega$ model on \ER\, graphs, thus closing the gap between these two conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-local operators with low singularity kernels: regularity estimates and martingale problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14056v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the linear non-local operator $\mathcal{L}$ denoted by \[ \mathcal{L} u (x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \left(u(x+z)-u(x)\right) a(x,z)J(z)\,d z. \] Here $a(x,z)$ is bounded and $J(z)$ is the jumping kernel of a L\'evy process, which only has a low-order singularity near the origin and does not allow for standard scaling. The aim of this work is twofold. Firstly, we introduce generalized Orlicz-Besov spaces tailored to accommodate the analysis of elliptic equations associated with $\mathcal{L}$, and establish regularity results for the solutions of such equations in these spaces. Secondly, we investigate the martingale problem associated with $\mathcal{L}$. By utilizing analytic results, we prove the well-posedness of the martingale problem under mild conditions. Additionally, we obtain a new Krylov-type estimate for the martingale solution through the use of a Morrey-type inequality for generalized Orlicz-Besov spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogous to Kolmogorov's theorem for the existence of stochastic processes describing random functions, we consider theorems for the existence of stochastic processes describing random measures, as limits of inverse measure systems. Specifically, given a coherent inverse system of random (bounded/signed/positive/probability) histograms on refining partitions, we study conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a corresponding random inverse limit, a Radon probability measure on the space of (bounded/signed/positive/probability) measures. Depending on the topology (vague/tight/weak/total-variational) and Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random measure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of concentration (support/domination/discreteness). Results are applied in the well-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and in a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three families, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding conditions on defining parameters.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify the limit in a high temperature regime of classical beta ensembles on the real line and related eigenvalue processes by using the Markov--Krein transform. We show that the limiting measure of Gaussian beta ensembles (resp.\ beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles) is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of the Gaussian distribution (resp.\ the gamma distribution and the beta distribution). At the process level, we show that the limiting probability measure-valued process is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of a certain 1d stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity and Learning Lower Bounds for Hierarchical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs. We show that if each function in the hierarchy is $\varepsilon$-far from linear, the noise stability is exponentially small in the depth of the hierarchy.
  Our results have immediate applications for learning. In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014) our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions. Similarly, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021) our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for SQ learning under the Gaussian measure. Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022) our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the jump-size distribution for an M/G/1 storage system with Poisson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a non-parametric estimator for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the jump-size distribution for a storage system with compound Poisson input. The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\frac{\eta}{1+\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions. A heuristic method is further developed to address the case of an unknown rate of the compound Poisson input process.</description>

      <title>On the Aldous-Caputo Spectral Gap Conjecture for Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their celebrated paper (arXiv:0906.1238), Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer proved Aldous' conjecture and showed that for an arbitrary finite graph, the spectral gap of the interchange process is equal to the spectral gap of the underlying random walk. A crucial ingredient in the proof was the Octopus Inequality - a certain inequality of operators in the group ring $\mathbb{R}[\mathrm{Sym}_n]$ of the symmetric group. Here we generalize the Octopus Inequality and apply it to generalize the Caputo-Liggett-Richthammer Theorem to certain hypergraphs, proving some cases of a conjecture of Caputo.</description>

      <title>Free energy expansions of a conditional GinUE and large deviations of the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a planar Coulomb gas ensemble of size $N$ with the inverse temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Symbolic Correlation Integral and the Renyi-2 Entropy under Short-range Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Execution Strategies Incorporating Internal Liquidity Through Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithmic execution model that integrates interbank limit and market orders with internal liquidity generated through market making. Based on the Cartea et al.\cite{cartea2015algorithmic} framework, we incorporate market impact in interbank orders while excluding it for internal market-making transactions. Our model aims to optimize the balance between interbank and internal liquidity, reducing market impact and improving execution efficiency.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for Score-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework based on Malliavin calculus to derive exact analytical expressions for the score function $\nabla \log p_t(x)$, i.e., the gradient of the log-density associated with the solution to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our approach combines classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern stochastic analysis tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, and it works for both linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint, the Malliavin divergence (Skorokhod integral), and diffusion generative models, thereby providing a systematic method for computing $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. In the linear case, we present a detailed analysis showing that our formula coincides with the analytical score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation. For nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients, we derive a closed-form expression for $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. We evaluate the proposed framework across multiple generative tasks and find that its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These results can be generalised to broader classes of SDEs, paving the way for new score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Loss-Versus-Rebalancing under Deterministic and Generalized block-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although modern blockchains almost universally produce blocks at fixed intervals, existing models still lack an analytical formula for the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) incurred by Automated Market Makers (AMMs) liquidity providers in this setting. Leveraging tools from random walk theory, we derive the following closed-form approximation for the per block per unit of liquidity expected LVR under constant block time:
  \[ \overline{\mathrm{ARB}}= \frac{\,\sigma_b^{2}} {\,2+\sqrt{2\pi}\,\gamma/(|\zeta(1/2)|\,\sigma_b)\,}+O\!\bigl(e^{-\mathrm{const}\tfrac{\gamma}{\sigma_b}}\bigr)\;\approx\; \frac{\sigma_b^{2}}{\,2 + 1.7164\,\gamma/\sigma_b}, \] where $\sigma_b$ is the intra-block asset volatility, $\gamma$ the AMM spread and $\zeta$ the Riemann Zeta function. Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in fact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.
  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we demonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability that a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and that only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This shows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection against arbitrage for liquidity providers.</description>
