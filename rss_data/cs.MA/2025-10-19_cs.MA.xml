      <title>Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07829v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.</description>

      <title>TranSimHub:A Unified Air-Ground Simulation Platform for Multi-Modal Perception and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-ground collaborative intelligence is becoming a key approach for next-generation urban intelligent transportation management, where aerial and ground systems work together on perception, communication, and decision-making. However, the lack of a unified multi-modal simulation environment has limited progress in studying cross-domain perception, coordination under communication constraints, and joint decision optimization. To address this gap, we present TranSimHub, a unified simulation platform for air-ground collaborative intelligence. TranSimHub offers synchronized multi-view rendering across RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation modalities, ensuring consistent perception between aerial and ground viewpoints. It also supports information exchange between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles. We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground traffic scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TranSimHub.</description>

      <title>Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</description>

      <title>Build Your Personalized Research Group: A Multiagent Framework for Continual and Interactive Science Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context management that hinders long-horizon research. We present \texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring \textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a \coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization -- users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including \textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication} to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research -- from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.</description>

      <title>AURA: An Agent Autonomy Risk Assessment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score, evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents, synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H) communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise environments.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Logic Programs: A Secure, Multiagent, Concurrent, Logic Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms are distributed applications run by\linebreak cryptographically-identified people on their networked personal devices, where multiple disjoint platform instances emerge independently and coalesce when they interoperate. Their foundation is the grassroots social graph, upon which grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations can be built.
  Grassroots platforms have yet to be implemented, the key challenge being faulty and malicious participants: without secure programming support, correct participants cannot reliably identify each other, establish secure communication, or verify each other's code integrity.
  We present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a secure, multiagent, concurrent, logic programming language for implementing grassroots platforms. GLP extends logic programs with paired single-reader/single-writer (SRSW) logic variables, providing secure communication channels among cryptographically-identified people through encrypted, signed and attested messages, which enable identity and code integrity verification. We present GLP progressively: logic programs, concurrent GLP, multiagent GLP, augmenting it with cryptographic security, and providing smartphone implementation-ready specifications. We prove safety properties including that GLP computations are deductions, SRSW preservation, acyclicity, and monotonicity. We prove multiagent GLP is grassroots and that GLP streams achieve blockchain security properties. We present a grassroots social graph protocol establishing authenticated peer-to-peer connections and demonstrate secure grassroots social networking applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure Learning Should Be A Research Priority for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. However, the topology of these systems--how agents in MASs should be configured, connected, and coordinated--remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we call for a paradigm shift toward \emph{topology-aware MASs} that explicitly model and dynamically optimize the structure of inter-agent interactions. We identify three fundamental components--agents, communication links, and overall topology--that collectively determine the system's adaptability, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. To operationalize this vision, we introduce a systematic three-stage framework: 1) agent selection, 2) structure profiling, and 3) topology synthesis. This framework not only provides a principled foundation for designing MASs but also opens new research frontiers across language modeling, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling to ultimately unleash their full potential in complex real-world applications. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities in MASs evaluation. We hope our framework and perspectives offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Ego-graph inference for Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (Networked-MARL), decentralized agents must act under local observability and constrained communication over fixed physical graphs. Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.</description>

      <title>LayerCraft: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with CoT Reasoning and Layered Object Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has made remarkable progress, yet existing systems still lack intuitive control over spatial composition, object consistency, and multi-step editing. We present $\textbf{LayerCraft}$, a modular framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to orchestrate structured, layered image generation and editing. LayerCraft supports two key capabilities: (1) $\textit{structured generation}$ from simple prompts via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling it to decompose scenes, reason about object placement, and guide composition in a controllable, interpretable manner; and (2) $\textit{layered object integration}$, allowing users to insert and customize objects -- such as characters or props -- across diverse images or scenes while preserving identity, context, and style. The system comprises a coordinator agent, the $\textbf{ChainArchitect}$ for CoT-driven layout planning, and the $\textbf{Object Integration Network (OIN)}$ for seamless image editing using off-the-shelf T2I models without retraining. Through applications like batch collage editing and narrative scene generation, LayerCraft empowers non-experts to iteratively design, customize, and refine visual content with minimal manual effort. Code will be released at https://github.com/PeterYYZhang/LayerCraft.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bargaining Games Without Utilities: Mediated Solutions from Direction Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative bargaining games are widely used to model resource allocation and conflict resolution. Traditional solutions assume the mediator can access agents utility function values and gradients. However, there is an increasing number of settings, such as human AI interactions, where utility values may be inaccessible or incomparable due to unknown, nonaffine transformations. To model such settings, we consider that the mediator has access only to agents most preferred directions, i.e., normalized utility gradients in the decision space. To this end, we propose a cooperative bargaining algorithm where a mediator has access to only the direction oracle of each agent. We prove that unlike popular approaches such as the Nash and Kalai Smorodinsky bargaining solutions, our approach is invariant to monotonic nonaffine transformations, and that under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, this approach enjoys global asymptotic convergence to Pareto stationary solutions. Moreover, we show that the bargaining solutions found by our algorithm also satisfy the axioms of symmetry and (under slightly stronger conditions) independence of irrelevant alternatives, which are popular in the literature. Finally, we conduct experiments in two domains, multi agent formation assignment and mediated stock portfolio allocation, which validate these theoretic results. All code for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/suryakmurthy/dibs_bargaining.</description>

      <title>VLMLight: Safety-Critical Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>Where Did It All Go Wrong? A Hierarchical Look into Multi-Agent Error Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems. Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error attribution in multi-agent systems.</description>
