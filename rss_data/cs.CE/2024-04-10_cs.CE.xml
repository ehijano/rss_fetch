      <title>An adaptive acceleration scheme for phase-field fatigue computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field models of fatigue are capable of reproducing the main phenomenology of fatigue behavior. However, phase-field computations in the high-cycle fatigue regime are prohibitively expensive, due to the need to resolve spatially the small length scale inherent to phase-field models and temporally the loading history for several millions of cycles. As a remedy, we propose a fully adaptive acceleration scheme based on the cycle jump technique, where the cycle-by-cycle resolution of an appropriately determined number of cycles is skipped while predicting the local system evolution during the jump. The novelty of our approach is a cycle-jump criterion to determine the appropriate cycle-jump size based on a target increment of a global variable which monitors the advancement of fatigue. We propose the definition and meaning of this variable for three general stages of the fatigue life. In comparison to existing acceleration techniques, our approach needs no parameters and bounds for the cycle-jump size, and it works independently of the material, specimen or loading conditions. Since one of the monitoring variables is the fatigue crack length, we introduce an accurate, flexible and efficient method for its computation, which overcomes the issues of conventional crack tip tracking algorithms and enables the consideration of several cracks evolving at the same time. The performance of the proposed acceleration scheme is demonstrated with representative numerical examples, which show a speedup reaching four orders of magnitude in the high-cycle fatigue regime with consistently high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Temperature Prediction for Stored Grain: A Multi-model Fusion Strategy Based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature fluctuations significantly affect microorganism growth and pest activity in grain stacks. Thus, precise monitoring and forecasting of grain stack temperature are essential for maintaining the quality and safety of grain storage. This paper proposes a multi-model fusion approach to predict grain temperature using historical temperature data of stored grains and meteorological data from the region. Based on the proposed approaches, four distinct machine learning models, namely Adaboost, decision tree, extra trees, and random forest, are first developed. These models are then fine-tuned through parameter optimization to enhance their predictive capabilities. Subsequently, the optimized models are combined to form different ensemble models. In essence, the fusion process integrates the predictions of each individual model as new feature inputs into the prediction model. Furthermore, the study utilizes the random forest to identify the key factors influencing grain temperature, providing insights into the importance of different influencing factors. The experimental results demonstrate that the fusion models proposed in this paper have achieved higher prediction accuracy and robustness compared with the traditional prediction methods (i.e., single-model prediction). Additionally, the analysis of feature importance also offers empirical evidence for understanding the factors influencing grain temperature.</description>

      <title>Model-based deep reinforcement learning for accelerated learning from flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a technique to solve closed-loop flow control problems. Employing simulation-based environments in reinforcement learning enables a priori end-to-end optimization of the control system, provides a virtual testbed for safety-critical control applications, and allows to gain a deep understanding of the control mechanisms. While reinforcement learning has been applied successfully in a number of rather simple flow control benchmarks, a major bottleneck toward real-world applications is the high computational cost and turnaround time of flow simulations. In this contribution, we demonstrate the benefits of model-based reinforcement learning for flow control applications. Specifically, we optimize the policy by alternating between trajectories sampled from flow simulations and trajectories sampled from an ensemble of environment models. The model-based learning reduces the overall training time by up to $85\%$ for the fluidic pinball test case. Even larger savings are expected for more demanding flow simulations.</description>

      <title>A dataset of over one thousand computed tomography scans of battery cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery technology is increasingly important for global electrification efforts. However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.</description>
