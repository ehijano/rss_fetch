      <title>Kamp Theorem for Pomset Languages of Higher Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logics are a powerful tool to specify properties of computational systems. For concurrent programs, Higher Dimensional Automata (HDA) are a very expressive model of non-interleaving concurrency. HDA recognize languages of partially ordered multisets, or pomsets. Recent work has shown that Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic is as expressive as HDA for pomset languages. In the case of words, Kamp's theorem states that First Order (FO) logic is as expressive as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). In this paper, we extend this result to pomsets. To do so, we first investigate the class of pomset languages that are definable in FO. As expected, this is a strict subclass of MSO-definable languages. Then, we define a Linear Temporal Logic for pomsets, and show that it is equivalent to FO.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Global Optimization: From Theory to Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract measure___theoretic framework that serves as a tool to rigorously study stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms as a unified class. The framework is formulated in terms of probability kernels, which, via the Ionescu--Tulcea theorem, induce probability measures on the space of sequences of algorithm iterations, endowed with two intuitive properties. This framework answers the need for a general, implementation___independent formalism in the analysis of such algorithms, providing a starting point for formalizing general results in proof-assistants. To illustrate the relevance of our tool, we show that common algorithms fit naturally in the framework, and we also use it to give a rigorous proof of a general consistency theorem for stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms (Proposition 3 of (Malherbe, et al., 2017). This proof and the entire framework are formalized in the Lean proof assistant. This formalization both ensures the correctness of the definitions and proofs, and provides a basis for future machine-assisted formalizations in the field.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalization in the Lean4 theorem prover of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, which characterizes regular local rings as those Noetherian local rings with finite global dimension. Rather than following the well-known proof that computes the projective dimension of the residue field via quotient by regular sequences and uses the Koszul complex to bound the cotangent space dimension by the global dimension, our approach is built systematically on the formalization of depth defined via the vanishing of Ext functors. We establish key homological results including Rees' theorem, the Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, and Ischebeck's theorem, and further develop the theories of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, including a complete formalization of the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings. To prove the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, we show that maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over regular local rings are free and establish a weakened form of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem specific for the unique maximal ideal. As corollaries, we deduce that regularity can be checked at maximal ideals and formalize Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem. This work demonstrates how homological algebra can be effectively employed in the formalization of commutative algebra, providing extensive infrastructure for future developments in the field.</description>
