      <title>A P-theorem for Inverse Semigroupoids through Ordered Globalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every ordered partial action of an inverse semigroupoid on a partially ordered set admits a globalization. This result is used to establish a connection between ordered partial actions of groupoids and a multi-object analogue of McAlister triples. As a consequence, we obtain a multi-object version of the P-theorem: every E-unitary inverse semigroupoid is isomorphic to a semidirect product arising from an ordered partial action of a groupoid on a multi-object version of a semilattice.</description>

      <title>Representable tangent structures for affine schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category of affine schemes is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by K\"ahler differentials, providing a direct link between algebraic geometry and tangent category theory. Moreover, this tangent bundle functor is represented by the ring of dual numbers. How special is this tangent structure? Is there any other (non-trivial) tangent structure on the category of affine schemes? In this paper, we characterize the representable tangent structures on the category of affine schemes. To do so, we introduce a useful tool, the notion of tangentoids, which are the precisely the objects in a monoidal category that when tensoring with said objects give tangent structures. Therefore, coexponentiable tangentoids induce tangent structures on the opposite category. As such, we first prove that tangentoids in the category of commutative unital algebras are equivalent to commutative associative solid non-unital algebras, that is, commutative associative non-unital algebras whose multiplication is an isomorphism. From here, we then explain how representable tangent structures on affine schemes correspond to finitely generated projective commutative associative solid algebras. In particular, for affine schemes over a principal ideal domain, we show that there are precisely two representable tangent structures: the trivial one and the one given by K\"ahler differentials.</description>

      <title>Excellent metrics on triangulated categories, and the involutivity of the map taking $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathfrak{S}({\mathcal{S})^{\mathrm{op}}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article arXiv:1806.06471 we defined good metrics on triangulated categories, and then studied the construction, that began with a triangulated category $\mathcal{S}$ together with a good metric $\{\mathcal{M}_i,\,i\in\mathbb{N}\}$, and out of it cooked up another triangulated category $\mathfrak(\mathcal{S})$. We went on to study examples, and produced many for which the construction is involutive. By this we mean that, if you let $\mathcal{T}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{S})^{\mathrm{op}}$, then there is a choice of metric on $\mathcal{T}$ for which $\mathcal{S}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{T})^{\mathrm{op}}$. In this article we study this phenomenon much more carefully, with the focus being on understanding the metrics for which involutivity occurs. As it turns out there is a large class of them, the excellent metrics on triangulated categories. At the end we will produce a few new examples of excellent metrics. And our reason for going to all this trouble is that the results of this article will permit us to prove new and surprising statements about uniqueness of enhancements. Those results will come in a sequel to this article, which is joint with Canonaco and Stellari.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Machine Learning Systems via Category Theory: Applications to Spherical Attention for Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence architectures.</description>

Abstract: We revisit an old assertion due to Rouquier, characterizing the perfect complexes as bounded homological functors on the bounded complexes of coherent sheaves. The new results vastly generalize the old statement---first of all the ground ring is not restricted to be a field, any commutative, noetherian ring will do. But the generalization goes further, to the abstract world of approximable triangulated categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.06471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an essentially small triangulated category it is possible to give a metric on it, to complete it with respect to the metric, and to look at the subcategory of objects in the completion which are compactly supported with respect to the metric. The main theorem says that this procedure produces a new triangulated category. And then we give examples: for example we learn that it is possible, for suitable choices of metrics, to produce the categories $D^b(R-\text{mod})$ and $K^b(R-\text{proj})$ out of each other.</description>

      <title>Naturality for higher-dimensional path types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a naturality construction for the operations of weak omega-categories, as a meta-operation in a dependent type theory. Our construction has a geometrical motivation as a local tensor product with a directed interval, and behaves logically as a globular analogue of Reynolds parametricity. Our construction operates as a ``power tool'' to support construction of terms with geometrical structure, and we use it to define composition operations for cylinders and cones in omega-categories. The machinery can generate terms of high complexity, and we have implemented our construction in a proof assistant, which verifies that the generated terms have the correct type. All our results can be exported to homotopy type theory, allowing the explicit computation of complex path type inhabitants.</description>

      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. We show the complete prime spectrum is functorial and give a characterization of when a monoidal exact functor induces a well-defined map on noncommutative Balmer spectra. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Extriangulated length categories: torsion classes and $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of extriangulated length categories, whose prototypical examples include abelian length categories and bounded derived categories of finite dimensional algebras with finite global dimension. We prove that an extriangulated category $\mathcal{A}$ is a length category if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ admits a simple-minded system. Subsequently, we study the partially ordered set ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ of torsion classes in an extriangulated length category $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ from the perspective of lattice theory. It is shown that ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ forms a complete lattice, which is further proved to be completely semidistributive and algebraic. Moreover, we describe the arrows in the Hasse quiver of ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ using brick labeling. Finally, we introduce the concepts of support torsion classes and support $\tau$-tilting subcategories in extriangulated length categories and establish a bijection between these two notions, thereby generalizing the Adachi-Iyama-Reiten bijection for functorially finite torsion classes.</description>
