      <title>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust surface states are a defining feature of topological photonic and acoustic systems. Although the supercell technique is commonly used for studying their surface effects, it falls short in sorting the states at two boundaries, differentiating surface states from bulk states, and demanding large computational resources. To overcome the limitations, we employ surface Green's functions combined with two efficient algorithms to obtain the ideal surface states for a semi-infinite system. They are further extended to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. Photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are taken as examples for demonstration and verification. The surface spectra obtained from our approach can be directly used for comparison with experimental observables. Our approach enriches the efficient computational tools for topological photonics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Optimized waveguides for mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems: A rigorous design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy is a well-established technique for non-destructive quantitative molecular analysis. Waveguide-integrated sensors provide a particularly compact solution operating with reduced sample volumes while exhibiting exquisite molecular selectivity, sensitivity, and ultra-low limits of detection. Recent advances in mid-infrared technologies along with the integration of on-chip sources, detectors and microfluidics, have brought mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems closer to reality. A variety of material platforms has been proposed for the implementation of such systems. However, the lack of a consistent waveguide design approach renders a fair comparison between different alternatives - and a deliberate material selection - challenging, limiting the development of optimized on-chip spectroscopic devices. In the present study, a systematic waveguide design approach has been developed, facilitating evanescent field absorption-based sensing, in particular for aqueous analytes. Our strategy enables a rigorous comparison of several state-of-the-art thin-film waveguides using parametric expressions to predict the achievable limits of detection of the sensing system, while indicating optimum waveguide dimensions and absorption pathlengths, pivotal for the development of next-generation mid-infrared lab-on-chip devices.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for resonant states near a bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states near a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix is subject to a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of cylinders on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.</description>

      <title>General theory of moving Fabry-Perot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a follow-up effort to our prior report on the optical transmission of a moving Fabry-Perot \cite{Pyvovar}, this work seeks to establish a general framework that describes the transmission and reflection properties of a Fabry-Perot interferometer when key components in its operation system, including the light source, the detector and the interferometer itself, have relative motions against each other along their common optical axis. Our analysis indicates that these movements result in various new factors in the transmission and reflection coefficients, which all find their roots in the Doppler effect. As a demonstration of its potential application, the new theory is applied to the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking technique. It is shown that velocity-induced frequency modulations are effectively added to the laser frequency due to the motions, and such excess frequency noise can be impactful in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Amplified Light Beam Cooling via Emergent Onsager's Irreversible Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-brightness coherent light source is at the heart of optical technology and yet challenging to achieve. Here, we propose an unconventional approach that utilizes the "forbidden chemical" in optical thermodynamics to convert any incoming light beam into a high-brightness, high-spatial-coherence light beam in multimode nonlinear optical waveguide systems, in contrast to evaporative cooling in cold atoms where the brightness is instead reduced. This approach is powered by the fact that light in nonlinear multimode structures undergoes an irreversible thermalization process triggered by its own photon-photon interactions. Moreover, the key characteristics in statistical mechanics, the optical temperature and chemical potential can be widely tuned in photonic systems. As such, when the chemical potential of an optical reservoir is designed to locate at the forbidden band of the probe bosonic system, it can never reach thermal equilibrium with the probe hence endlessly pumping the probe system towards an enhanced brightness and spatial coherence. This amplified cooling of light beam is revealed via both Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics theory and numerical simulations. Akin to this effect, the inverse photonic transport currents emerge due to the negative off-diagonal Onsager coefficients. We demonstrate the feasibility of the amplified beam cooling using a coupled multimode optical waveguide system and show that after 800 rounds of amplified cooling, the optical power of an incoming beam is enhanced by 16 times, meanwhile the fundamental mode occupancy is increased to 90%. These findings unveil an anomalous optical phenomenon and a new route toward high-quality light sources.</description>

      <title>Picosecond laser pulses for quantum dot-microcavity based single photon generation by cascaded electro-optic modulation of a narrow-linewidth laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in integrated optics have made it possible to fabricate high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators (EOMs). Here we show cascaded operation of two of such modulators driven by custom-built electronics delivering on-demand picosecond pulses and application to a quantum dot cavity-QED single photon source. We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate light pulses as short as 24$\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be synchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17 ps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices the transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we show that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB can be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we demonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based single photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and synchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the many applications of whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonators, Single-atom cavity-QED poses the most extreme demands on mode-volume and quality factor. Here we present a model-based procedure for the fabrication of small mode-volume ultrahigh Q silica WGM microresonators of varying geometries, from toroidal to micro-spheres. We experimentally demonstrate WGM resonators with ultra-high qualities as high as $1.7\times 10^8$ at 780nm. We present a theoretical model that allows tailoring the recipe to attain the desired geometry of the fabricated WGM microresonators.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of photonic phase correctors based on grating coupler arrays and thermo-optic shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ground-based astronomy, the ability to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs) is limited by atmospheric turbulence, which prohibits the use of many astrophotonic instruments. We propose a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip capable of coherently coupling the out-of-phase beamlets from the subapertures of a telescope pupil into an SMF. The photonic integrated circuit (PIC) consists of an array of grating couplers that are used to inject light from free space into single-mode waveguides on the chip. Metallic heaters modulate the refractive index of a coiled section of the waveguides, facilitating the co-phasing of the propagating modes. The phased beamlets can then be coherently combined to efficiently deliver the light to an output SMF. In an adaptive optics (AO) system, the phase corrector acts as a deformable mirror (DM) commanded by a controller that takes phase measurements from a wavefront sensor (WFS). We present experimental results for the PIC tested on an AO testbed and compare the performance to simulations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the coupling of photon spin with rotation in connection with a recent proposal of Fedderke et al. [arXiv:2406.16178 [physics.optics]] regarding a precision gyroscope based on the intrinsic spin of light. To this end, we analyze the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a physical system that uniformly rotates about the direction of wave propagation in the presence of an ambient medium. Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Light scrambling and focal ratio degradation of thin multimode fibers with different core geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of fiber-fed astronomical spectrographs is highly influenced by the properties of fibers. The near-field and far-field scrambling characteristics have a profound impact on the line spread function (LSF) of the spectra. Focal ratio degradation (FRD) influences the output beam size, thereby affecting the throughput, as well as the size of the collimator and dispersion elements. While previous research has indicated that these properties depend on the shape of the fiber core and showed that non-circular core fibers can yield uniform near-field scrambling, the result remains inconclusive for far-field. In this study, we investigate the near-field and far-field scrambling properties, along with the FRD, of 50-micron core fibers with different core geometries. We find that in addition to excellent near-field scrambling, octagonal-core fibers can also produce more uniform far-field output when compared to circular-core fibers. They also have less FRD effect when being fed with a f/3 beam.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently, the optical selection rules for excitons under circularly-polarized light are manifestly gauge-dependent. Recently, Fernando et al. introduced a gauge-invariant, quantized interband index. This index may improve the topological classification of material excited states because it is intrinsically an inter-level quantity. In this work, we expand on this index to introduce its chiral formulation, and use it to make the selection rules gauge-invariant. We anticipate this development to strengthen the theory of quantum materials, especially two-dimensional semiconductor photophysics.</description>

Abstract: Speckle patterns are a powerful tool for high-precision metrology, as they allow remarkable performance in relatively simple setups. Nonetheless, researchers in this field follow rather distinct paths due to underappreciated general principles underlying speckle phenomena. Here, we advise on a universal metric of intrinsic speckle sensitivity, and on the advantages and disadvantages of multiple scattering. This will catalyse progress in speckle metrology but will also translate to other domains of disordered optics which are undergoing rapid developments at present.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping sub-wavelength-sized particles in all spatial directions has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a trapped particle with a radius of 15 nm experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at short-wave infrared and near-infrared frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral metasurfaces based on structured van der Waals materials</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear chiral photonics explores nonlinear response of chiral structures, and it offers a pathway to novel optical functionalities not accessible through linear or achiral systems. Here we present the first application of nanostructured van der Waals materials to nonlinear chiral photonics. We demonstrate the three orders of magnitude enhancement of the third-harmonic generation from hBN metasurfaces driven by quasi-bound states in the continuum and accompanied by strong nonlinear circular dichroism at the resonances. This novel platform for chiral metaphotonics can be employed for achieving large circular dichroism combined with high-efficiency harmonic generation in a broad frequency range.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques. In the chemical etching technique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% of hydrofluoric acid solutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters of MNFs range is 0.34 $\mu$m - 1.4 $\mu$m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 $\mu$m - 0.53 $\mu$m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Non-classical correlations between photons and phonons of center-of-mass motion of a mechanical oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate non-classical correlations between phonons and photons created using opto-mechanical spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a system based on a soft-clamped ultracoherent membrane oscillator inside of a Fabry-P\'erot optical resonator. Non-Gaussian quantum features are demonstrated for the center-of-mass motion of a sub-millimeter nanogram-scale mechanical oscillator. We show that phonons stored in the mechanical oscillator, when subsequently read out, display strong signs of quantum coherence, which we demonstrate by single-photon counting enabled by our state-of-the-art optical filtering system. We observe a violation of the classical two-time Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between a heralding write photon and a stored phonon with a confidence of $&gt;92\%$.</description>

      <title>Single-photon phase spectrum recovery from the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the temporal-spectral profile of single photons is essential for quantum information protocol utilizing temporal mode for encoding. Based on the phase retrieval algorithm, we present a method to reconstruct the phase spectrum difference between two wave packets from their Hong-Ou-Mandel dip, and intensity spectra. Our confirmatory experiment with weak coherent wave packets demonstrated the accuracy of the reconstructed phase spectrum difference to within plus or minus 0.1 rad. This method is generalizable to the measurement of unknown single-photon wave packets with the aid of a reference wave packet, requiring only the collection of one-dimensional data, which simplifies and expedites the process.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable isomorphic physical neural networks (PNNs) are emerging NN acceleration paradigms for their high-bandwidth, in-propagation computation. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training is often the industry standard for its robustness and fast gradient convergences, existing BP-PNN training methods need to truncate the propagation of analogue signal at each layer and acquire accurate hidden neuron readouts for deep networks. This compromises the incentive of PNN for fast in-propagation processing. In addition, the required readouts introduce massive bottlenecks due to the conversions between the analogue-digital interfaces to shuttle information across. These factors limit both the time and energy efficiency during training. Here we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, a BP-based method that can perform training on an encapsulated deep network, where the information propagation is maintained within the analogue domain until the output layer. AT's minimum information access bypass analogue-digital interface bottleneck wherever possible. For any deep network structure, AT offers significantly improved time and energy efficiency compared to existing BP-PNN methods, and scales well for large network sizes. We demonstrated AT's error-tolerant and calibration-free training for encapsulated integrated photonic deep networks to achieve near ideal BP performances. AT's well-behaved training is demonstrated repeatably across different datasets and network structures</description>
