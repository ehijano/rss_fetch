      <title>sLORETA is equivalent to single dipole scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that each member of a family of reconstruction approaches, which includes the classical sLORETA approach and the eLORETA approach, is exactly equivalent to a single dipole scan in some inner product norm. Additionally, we investigate NAI/AG and SAM/UNG beamformers and show that, in scenarios with a single active source with additive uncorrelated noise, they are also equivalent to some form of dipole scanning. As a particular consequence, this shows that, under ideal conditions in a noisy single source case, NAI and SAM (resp. AG and UNG) beamformers are equivalent. Finally, we also discuss how to generalize scalar beamformers to vector beamformers.</description>

      <title>EEG-Language Modeling for Pathology Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling constitutes a recent breakthrough which leverages advances in large language models to pretrain capable multimodal models. The integration of natural language during pretraining has been shown to significantly improve learned representations, particularly in computer vision. However, the efficacy of multimodal language modeling in the realm of functional brain data, specifically for advancing pathology detection, remains unexplored. This study pioneers EEG-language models trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We extend methods for multimodal alignment to this novel domain and investigate which textual information in reports is useful for training EEG-language models. Our results indicate that models learn richer representations from being exposed to a variety of report segments, including the patient's clinical history, description of the EEG, and the physician's interpretation. Compared to models exposed to narrower clinical text information, we find such models to retrieve EEGs based on clinical reports (and vice versa) with substantially higher accuracy. Yet, this is only observed when using a contrastive learning approach. Particularly in regimes with few annotations, we observe that representations of EEG-language models can significantly improve pathology detection compared to those of EEG-only models, as demonstrated by both zero-shot classification and linear probes. In sum, these results highlight the potential of integrating brain activity data with clinical text, suggesting that EEG-language models represent significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>VSLLaVA: a pipeline of large multimodal foundation model for industrial vibration signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models have been extensively utilized for image recognition tasks guided by instructions, yet there remains a scarcity of domain expertise in industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper presents a pipeline named VSLLaVA that leverages a large language model to integrate expert knowledge for identification of signal parameters and diagnosis of faults. Within this pipeline, we first introduce an expert rule-assisted signal generator. The generator merges signal provided by vibration analysis experts with domain-specific parameter identification and fault diagnosis question-answer pairs to build signal-question-answer triplets. Then we use these triplets to apply low-rank adaptation methods for fine-tuning the linear layers of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and large language model, injecting multimodal signal processing knowledge. Finally, the fine-tuned model is assessed through the combined efforts of large language model and expert rules to evaluate answer accuracy and relevance, which showcases enhanced performance in identifying, analyzing various signal parameters, and diagnosing faults. These enhancements indicate the potential of this pipeline to build a foundational model for future industrial signal analysis and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Pest Manager: A Systematic Framework for Precise Pest Counting and Identification in Invisible Grain Pile Storage Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pest infestations pose a significant risk to both the quality and quantity of stored grain, resulting in substantial economic losses. Accurate and timely pest monitoring is essential, but traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and often ineffective at detecting pests beneath the grain surface. In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework: Pest Manager for precise pest counting and identification within the invisible grain pile environment. The framework consists of three components: an improved grain probe trap PestMoni, a pest drop dataset PestSet collected by PestMoni, and a multi-task Transformer-based architecture PestFormer for pest counting and identification. Specifically, PestMoni uses an asymmetric layout of infrared diodes and photodiodes, enabling precise recording of pest drops. Based on PestMoni, we develop PestSet, an infrared-perception dataset for pest drops, including five common grain storage pests. Furthermore, we propose PestFormer, a multi-task model with a conditional modification module to reduce deviations across different PestMonis and thereby normalize the data processing workflow. Extensive experiments validate the design, dataset, and model, with PestFormer achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.2% in counting and 86.9% in identification, highlighting its potential for effective pest management in invisible storage environment.</description>

      <title>FORS-EMG: A Novel sEMG Dataset for Hand Gesture Recognition Across Multiple Forearm Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal holds great potential in the research fields of gesture recognition and the development of robust prosthetic hands. However, the sEMG signal is compromised with physiological or dynamic factors such as forearm orientations, electrode displacement, limb position, etc. The existing dataset of sEMG is limited as they often ignore these dynamic factors during recording. In this paper, we have proposed a dataset of multichannel sEMG signals to evaluate common daily living hand gestures performed with three forearm orientations. The dataset is collected from nineteen intact-limed subjects, performing twelve hand gestures with three forearm orientations: supination, rest, and pronation.Additionally, two electrode placement positions (elbow and forearm) are considered while recording the sEMG signal. The dataset is open for public access in MATLAB file format. The key purpose of the dataset is to offer an extensive resource for developing a robust machine learning classification algorithm and hand gesture recognition applications. We validated the high quality of the dataset by assessing the signal quality matrices and classification performance, utilizing popular machine learning algorithms, various feature extraction methods, and variable window size. The obtained result highlighted the significant potential of this novel sEMG dataset that can be used as a benchmark for developing hand gesture recognition systems, conducting clinical research on sEMG, and developing human-computer interaction applications.

      <title>Optimization and Deployment of Deep Neural Networks for PPG-based Blood Pressure Estimation Targeting Low-power Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PPG-based Blood Pressure (BP) estimation is a challenging biosignal processing task for low-power devices such as wearables. State-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained for this task implement either a PPG-to-BP signal-to-signal reconstruction or a scalar BP value regression and have been shown to outperform classic methods on the largest and most complex public datasets. However, these models often require excessive parameter storage or computational effort for wearable deployment, exceeding the available memory or incurring too high latency and energy consumption. In this work, we describe a fully-automated DNN design pipeline, encompassing HW-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Quantization, thanks to which we derive accurate yet lightweight models, that can be deployed on an ultra-low-power multicore System-on-Chip (SoC), GAP8. Starting from both regression and signal-to-signal state-of-the-art models on four public datasets, we obtain optimized versions that achieve up to 4.99% lower error or 73.36% lower size at iso-error. Noteworthy, while the most accurate SoA network on the largest dataset can not fit the GAP8 memory, all our optimized models can; our most accurate DNN consumes as little as 0.37 mJ while reaching the lowest MAE of 8.08 on Diastolic BP estimation.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning-based User Identification with Limited Data on Smart Textiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-sensitive smart textiles are widely applied in the fields of healthcare, sports monitoring, and intelligent homes. The integration of devices embedded with pressure sensing arrays is expected to enable comprehensive scene coverage and multi-device integration. However, the implementation of identity recognition, a fundamental function in this context, relies on extensive device-specific datasets due to variations in pressure distribution across different devices. To address this challenge, we propose a novel user identification method based on contrastive learning. We design two parallel branches to facilitate user identification on both new and existing devices respectively, employing supervised contrastive learning in the feature space to promote domain unification. When encountering new devices, extensive data collection efforts are not required; instead, user identification can be achieved using limited data consisting of only a few simple postures. Through experimentation with two 8-subject pressure datasets (BedPressure and ChrPressure), our proposed method demonstrates the capability to achieve user identification across 12 sitting scenarios using only a dataset containing 2 postures. Our average recognition accuracy reaches 79.05%, representing an improvement of 2.62% over the best baseline model.</description>

      <title>Complex Emotion Recognition System using basic emotions via Facial Expression, EEG, and ECG Signals: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Complex Emotion Recognition System (CERS) deciphers complex emotional states by examining combinations of basic emotions expressed, their interconnections, and the dynamic variations. Through the utilization of advanced algorithms, CERS provides profound insights into emotional dynamics, facilitating a nuanced understanding and customized responses. The attainment of such a level of emotional recognition in machines necessitates the knowledge distillation and the comprehension of novel concepts akin to human cognition. The development of AI systems for discerning complex emotions poses a substantial challenge with significant implications for affective computing. Furthermore, obtaining a sizable dataset for CERS proves to be a daunting task due to the intricacies involved in capturing subtle emotions, necessitating specialized methods for data collection and processing. Incorporating physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) can notably enhance CERS by furnishing valuable insights into the user's emotional state, enhancing the quality of datasets, and fortifying system dependability. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in this study to assess the efficacy of machine learning, deep learning, and meta-learning approaches in both basic and complex emotion recognition utilizing EEG, ECG signals, and facial expression datasets. The chosen research papers offer perspectives on potential applications, clinical implications, and results of CERSs, with the objective of promoting their acceptance and integration into clinical decision-making processes. This study highlights research gaps and challenges in understanding CERSs, encouraging further investigation by relevant studies and organizations. Lastly, the significance of meta-learning approaches in improving CERS performance and guiding future research endeavors is underscored.</description>

      <title>Validation of Practicality for CSI Sensing Utilizing Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we leveraged Channel State Information (CSI), commonly utilized in WLAN communication, as training data to develop and evaluate five distinct machine learning models for recognizing human postures: standing, sitting, and lying down. The models we employed were: (i) Linear Discriminant Analysis, (ii) Naive Bayes-Support Vector Machine, (iii) Kernel-Support Vector Machine, (iv) Random Forest, and (v) Deep Learning. We systematically analyzed how the accuracy of these models varied with different amounts of training data. Additionally, to assess their spatial generalization capabilities, we evaluated the models' performance in a setting distinct from the one used for data collection. The experimental findings indicated that while two models -- (ii) Naive Bayes-Support Vector Machine and (v) Deep Learning -- achieved 85% or more accuracy in the original setting, their accuracy dropped to approximately 30% when applied in a different environment. These results underscore that although CSI-based machine learning models can attain high accuracy within a consistent spatial structure, their performance diminishes considerably with changes in spatial conditions, highlighting a significant challenge in their generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Polarforming for Wireless Communications: Modeling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, the concept of \textit{polarforming} for wireless communications. Polarforming refers to a novel technique that enables dynamic adjustment of antenna polarization using reconfigurable polarized antennas (RPAs). It can fully leverage polarization diversity to improve the performance of wireless communication systems by aligning the effective polarization state of the incoming electromagnetic (EM) wave with the antenna polarization. To better demonstrate the benefits of polarforming, we propose a general RPA-aided system that allows for tunable antenna polarization. A wavefront-based channel model is developed to properly capture depolarization behaviors in both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels. Based on this model, we provide a detailed description of transmit and receive polarforming on planes of polarization (PoPs). We also evaluate the performance gains provided by polarforming under stochastic channel conditions. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the relative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain compared to conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems and approximate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the RPA system. Our analysis reveals that polarforming offers a diversity gain of two, indicating full utilization of polarization diversity for dual-polarized antennas. Furthermore, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming and exhibit substantial improvements over conventional FPA systems. The results also indicate that polarforming not only can combat depolarization effects caused by wireless channels but also can overcome channel correlation when scattering is insufficient.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation for DoA Estimation in Multipath Channels with Interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of a desired source located in a known region of interest in the presence of interfering sources and multipath. We propose an approach that precedes the DoA estimation and relies on generating a set of reference steering vectors. The steering vectors' generative model is a free space model, which is beneficial for many DoA estimation algorithms. The set of reference steering vectors is then used to compute a function that maps the received signals from the adverse environment to a reference domain free from interfering sources and multipath. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed map, which is analogous to domain adaption, improves DoA estimation by mitigating interference and multipath effects. Specifically, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy when the proposed approach is applied before three commonly used beamformers: the delay-and-sum (DS), the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), and the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC).</description>

      <title>Smart CSI Processing for Accruate Commodity WiFi-based Humidity Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor humidity is a crucial factor affecting people's health and well-being. Wireless humidity sensing techniques are scalable and low-cost, making them a promising solution for measuring humidity in indoor environments without requiring additional devices. Such, machine learning (ML) assisted WiFi sensing is being envisioned as the key enabler for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, the current WiFi-based sensing systems, such as WiHumidity, suffer from low accuracy. We propose an enhanced WiFi-based humidity detection framework to address this issue that utilizes innovative filtering and data processing techniques to exploit humidity-specific channel state information (CSI) signatures during RF sensing. These signals are then fed into ML algorithms for detecting different humidity levels. Specifically, our improved de-noising solution for the CSI captured by commodity hardware for WiFi sensing, combined with the k-th nearest neighbour ML algorithm and resolution tuning technique, helps improve humidity sensing accuracy. Our commercially available hardware-based experiments provide insights into achievable sensing resolution. Our empirical investigation shows that our enhanced framework can improve the accuracy of humidity sensing to 97%.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) remains a fundamental tool in cardiac diagnostics, yet its interpretation traditionally reliant on the expertise of cardiologists. The emergence of deep learning has heralded a revolutionary era in medical data analysis, particularly in the domain of ECG diagnostics. However, inter-patient variability prohibit the generalibility of ECG-AI model trained on a population dataset, hence degrade the performance of ECG-AI on specific patient or patient group. Many studies have address this challenge using different deep learning technologies. This comprehensive review systematically synthesizes research from a wide range of studies to provide an in-depth examination of cutting-edge deep-learning techniques in personalized ECG diagnosis. The review outlines a rigorous methodology for the selection of pertinent scholarly articles and offers a comprehensive overview of deep learning approaches applied to personalized ECG diagnostics. Moreover, the challenges these methods encounter are investigated, along with future research directions, culminating in insights into how the integration of deep learning can transform personalized ECG diagnosis and enhance cardiac care. By emphasizing both the strengths and limitations of current methodologies, this review underscores the immense potential of deep learning to refine and redefine ECG analysis in clinical practice, paving the way for more accurate, efficient, and personalized cardiac diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Autonomous Guided Vehicles based on Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Digital Twin (DT) framework for the remote control of an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) within a Network Control System (NCS). The AGV is monitored and controlled using Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). In order to meet the real-time requirements, the DT computes the control signals and dynamically allocates resources for sensing and communication. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm is derived to learn and provide suitable actions while adjusting for the uncertainty in the AGV's position. We present closed-form expressions for the achievable communication rate and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) to determine the required number of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers, meeting the needs of both sensing and communication. The proposed algorithm is validated through a millimeter-Wave (mmWave) simulation, demonstrating significant improvements in both control precision and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>A White-Box Deep-Learning Method for Electrical Energy System Modeling Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have been widely used as an end-to-end modeling strategy of electrical energy systems because of their conveniency and powerful pattern recognition capability. However, due to the "black-box" nature, deep learning methods have long been blamed for their poor interpretability when modeling a physical system. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network structure, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), to achieve "white-box" modeling for electrical energy systems to enhance the interpretability. The most distinct feature of KAN lies in the learnable activation function together with the sparse training and symbolification process. Consequently, KAN can express the physical process with concise and explicit mathematical formulas while remaining the nonlinear-fitting capability of deep neural networks. Simulation results based on three electrical energy systems demonstrate the effectiveness of KAN in the aspects of interpretability, accuracy, robustness and generalization ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a technique of signal acquisition using a combination of two devices with different sampling rates and quantization accuracies. Subsequent processing involving sparsity regularization enables us to reconstruct the signal at such a sampling frequency and with such a bit depth that was not possible using the two devices independently. Objective and subjective tests show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with alternatives.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Normalization of Channel Matrix for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications introduce innovative antenna array configurations, such as dense arrays and volumetric arrays, which offer notable advantages over conventional planar arrays with half-wavelength element spacing. However, accurately assessing the performance of these new holographic MIMO systems necessitates careful consideration of channel matrix normalization, as it is influenced by array gain, which, in turn, depends on the array topology. Traditional normalization methods may be insufficient for assessing these advanced array topologies, potentially resulting in misleading or inaccurate evaluations. In this study, we propose electromagnetic normalization approaches for the channel matrix that accommodate arbitrary array topologies, drawing on the array gains from analytical, physical, and full-wave methods. Additionally, we introduce a normalization method for near-field MIMO channels based on a rigorous dyadic Green's function approach, which accounts for potential losses of gain at near field. Finally, we perform capacity analyses under quasi-static, ergodic, and near-field conditions, through adopting the proposed normalization techniques. Our findings indicate that channel matrix normalization should reflect the realized gains of the antenna array in target directions. Failing to accurately normalize the channel matrix can result in errors when evaluating the performance limits and benefits of unconventional holographic array topologies, potentially compromising the optimal design of holographic MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Mental Stress Detection and Performance Enhancement Using FNIRS and Wrist Vibrator Biofeedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any person in his/her daily life activities experiences different kinds and various amounts of mental stress which has a destructive effect on their performance. Therefore, it is crucial to come up with a systematic way of stress management and performance enhancement. This paper presents a comprehensive portable and real-time biofeedback system that aims at boosting stress management and consequently performance enhancement. For this purpose, a real-time brain signal acquisition device, a wireless vibration biofeedback device, and a software-defined program for stress level classification have been developed. More importantly, the entire system has been designed to present minimum time delay by propitiously bridging all the essential parts of the system together. We have presented different signal processing and feature extraction techniques for an online stress detection application. Accordingly, by testing the stress classification section of the system, an accuracy of 83% and a recall detecting the true mental stress level of 92% was achieved. Moreover, the biofeedback system as integrity has been tested on 20 participants in the controlled experimental setup. Experiment evaluations show promising results of system performances, and the findings reveal that our system is able to help the participants reduce their stress level by 55% and increase their accuracy by 24.5%. It can be concluded from the observations that all primary premises on stress management and performance enhancement through reward learning are valid as well.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Learning-based Cascaded Channel Feedback in RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems, the connection between a base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) is formed by a cascaded channel, merging the BS-RIS and RIS-UE channels. Due to the fixed positioning of the BS and RIS and the mobility of UE, these two channels generally exhibit different time-varying characteristics, which are challenging to identify and exploit for feedback overhead reduction, given the separate channel estimation difficulty. To address this challenge, this letter introduces an innovative deep learning-based framework tailored for cascaded channel feedback, ingeniously capturing the intrinsic time variation in the cascaded channel. When an entire cascaded channel has been sent to the BS, this framework advocates the feedback of an efficient representation of this variation within a subsequent period through an extraction-compression scheme. This scheme involves RIS unit-grained channel variation extraction, followed by autoencoder-based deep compression to enhance compactness. Numerical simulations confirm that this feedback framework significantly reduces both the feedback and computational burdens.</description>

      <title>Differences between Two Maximal Principal Strain Rate Calculation Schemes in Traumatic Brain Analysis with in-vivo and in-silico Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain deformation caused by a head impact leads to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The maximum principal strain (MPS) was used to measure the extent of brain deformation and predict injury, and the recent evidence has indicated that incorporating the maximum principal strain rate (MPSR) and the product of MPS and MPSR, denoted as MPSxSR, enhances the accuracy of TBI prediction. However, ambiguities have arisen about the calculation of MPSR. Two schemes have been utilized: one (MPSR1) is to use the time derivative of MPS, and another (MPSR2) is to use the first eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor. Both MPSR1 and MPSR2 have been applied in previous studies to predict TBI. To quantify the discrepancies between these two methodologies, we conducted a comparison of these two MPSR methodologies across nine in-vivo and in-silico head impact datasets and found that 95MPSR1 was 5.87% larger than 95MPSR2, and 95MPSxSR1 was 2.55% larger than 95MPSxSR2. Across every element in all head impacts, MPSR1 was 8.28% smaller than MPSR2, and MPSxSR1 was 8.11% smaller than MPSxSR2. Furthermore, logistic regression models were trained to predict TBI based on the MPSR (or MPSxSR), and no significant difference was observed in the predictability across different variables. The consequence of misuse of MPSR and MPSxSR thresholds (i.e. compare threshold of 95MPSR1 with value from 95MPSR2 to determine if the impact is injurious) was investigated, and the resulting false rates were found to be around 1%. The evidence suggested that these two methodologies were not significantly different in detecting TBI.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Integrated Silicon Devices: Active versus Passive -- The Eternal Struggle Between Good and Evil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the extreme scaling, active devices in both CMOS and BiCMOS technologies have reached outstanding ft/fmax, enabling an ever-increasing number of existing and emerging applications in the microwave and millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency range. The increase in transistors ft/fmax has been so much significant that the performance of microwave and mm-wave ICs are limited mainly by losses in passive devices. In this paper, we address a discussion on qualitative and quantitative aspects that may help to further unveil the impact of such losses on the overall circuit performance and stimulate the adoption of effective loss-aware design methodologies. As example, we report the results related to the design of low power mm-wave low noise amplifiers (LNAs). Our results show how, in low power regime, the performances of mm-wave LNAs are dominated by losses in passive components. We also show how loss-aware design methodologies can mitigate the performance degradation due to passives, resulting as an important tool to get the full potential out of the active devices available today.</description>

      <title>Identification of head impact locations, speeds, and force based on head kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Head impact information including impact directions, speeds and force are important to study traumatic brain injury, design and evaluate protective gears. This study presents a deep learning model developed to accurately predict head impact information, including location, speed, orientation, and force, based on head kinematics during helmeted impacts. Methods: Leveraging a dataset of 16,000 simulated helmeted head impacts using the Riddell helmet finite element model, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to process the head kinematics: tri-axial linear accelerations and angular velocities. Results: The models accurately predict the impact parameters describing impact location, direction, speed, and the impact force profile with R2 exceeding 70% for all tasks. Further validation was conducted using an on-field dataset recorded by instrumented mouthguards and videos, consisting of 79 head impacts in which the impact location can be clearly identified. The deep learning model significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving a 79.7% accuracy in identifying impact locations, compared to lower accuracies with traditional methods (the highest accuracy of existing methods is 49.4%). Conclusion: The precision underscores the model's potential in enhancing helmet design and safety in sports by providing more accurate impact data. Future studies should test the models across various helmets and sports on large in vivo datasets to validate the accuracy of the models, employing techniques like transfer learning to broaden its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free network is a new paradigm, originating from distributed MIMO, that has been investigated for a few recent years as an alternative to the celebrated cellular structure. Future networks not only consider classical data transmission but also positioning, along the lines of Integrated Communications and Sensing (ISAC). The goal of this paper is to investigate at the same time the ambiguity function which is an important metric for positioning and the understanding of its associated resolution and ambiguities, and the array gain when maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or MR combining (MRC) is implemented for data communications. In particular, the role and impact of using a waveform with non-zero bandwidth is investigated. The theoretical findings are illustrated by means of computational results.</description>

      <title>Tracking Network Dynamics using Probabilistic State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a probabilistic approach for tracking the dynamics of unweighted and directed graphs using state-space models (SSMs). Unlike conventional topology inference methods that assume static graphs and generate point-wise estimates, our method accounts for dynamic changes in the network structure over time. We model the network at each timestep as the state of the SSM, and use observations to update beliefs that quantify the probability of the network being in a particular state. Then, by considering the dynamics of transition and observation models through the update and prediction steps, respectively, the proposed method can incorporate the information of real-time graph signals into the beliefs. These beliefs provide a probability distribution of the network at each timestep, being able to provide both an estimate for the network and the uncertainty it entails. Our approach is evaluated through experiments with synthetic and real-world networks. The results demonstrate that our method effectively estimates network states and accounts for the uncertainty in the data, outperforming traditional techniques such as recursive least squares.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are equipped with Electronic Control Units (ECU) that are used for controlling important vehicle functions including safety-critical operations. ECUs exchange information via in-vehicle communication buses, of which the Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is by far the most widespread representative. Problems that may occur in the vehicle's physical parts or malicious attacks may cause anomalies in the CAN traffic, impairing the correct vehicle operation. Therefore, the detection of such anomalies is vital for vehicle safety. This paper reviews the research on anomaly detection for in-vehicle networks, more specifically for the CAN bus. Our main focus is the evaluation of methods used for CAN bus anomaly detection together with the datasets used in such analysis. To provide the reader with a more comprehensive understanding of the subject, we first give a brief review of related studies on time series-based anomaly detection. Then, we conduct an extensive survey of recent deep learning-based techniques as well as conventional techniques for CAN bus anomaly detection. Our comprehensive analysis delves into anomaly detection algorithms employed in in-vehicle networks, specifically focusing on their learning paradigms, inherent strengths, and weaknesses, as well as their efficacy when applied to CAN bus datasets. Lastly, we highlight challenges and open research problems in CAN bus anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale spatiotemporal representation learning for EEG-based emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition holds significant potential in the field of brain-computer interfaces. A key challenge lies in extracting discriminative spatiotemporal features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing studies often rely on domain-specific time-frequency features and analyze temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics separately, neglecting the interaction between local-global relationships and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel network called Multi-Scale Inverted Mamba (MS-iMamba), which consists of Multi-Scale Temporal Blocks (MSTB) and Temporal-Spatial Fusion Blocks (TSFB). Specifically, MSTBs are designed to capture both local details and global temporal dependencies across different scale subsequences. The TSFBs, implemented with an inverted Mamba structure, focus on the interaction between dynamic temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics. The primary advantage of MS-iMamba lies in its ability to leverage reconstructed multi-scale EEG sequences, exploiting the interaction between temporal and spatial features without the need for domain-specific time-frequency feature extraction. Experimental results on the DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets demonstrate that MS-iMamba achieves classification accuracies of 94.86%, 94.94%, and 91.36%, respectively, using only four-channel EEG signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Critically Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While systems analysis has been studied for decades in the context of control theory, it has only been recently used to improve the convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This work describes a novel improvement to Third- Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD), a recent diffusion method that performs better than its predecessors. This improvement, abbreviated TOLD++, is carried out by critically damping the TOLD forward transition matrix similarly to Dockhorn's Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD). Specifically, it exploits eigen-analysis of the forward transition matrix to derive the optimal set of dynamics under the original TOLD scheme. TOLD++ is theoretically guaranteed to converge faster than TOLD, and its faster convergence is verified on the Swiss Roll toy dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset according to the FID metric.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Balanced Signed Graphs via Iterative Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights, encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced signed graph has no cycles of odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map simply to ones in a similarity-transformed positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of well-studied spectral filters designed for positive graphs. We propose a fast method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, for each node $i$, to determine its polarity $\beta_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and edge weights $\{w_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^N$, we extend a sparse inverse covariance formulation based on linear programming (LP) called CLIME, by adding linear constraints to enforce ``consistent" signs of edge weights $\{w_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^N$ with the polarities of connected nodes -- i.e., positive/negative edges connect nodes of same/opposing polarities. For each LP, we adapt projections on convex set (POCS) to determine a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho &gt; 0$ that guarantees LP feasibility. We solve the resulting LP via an off-the-shelf LP solver in $\mathcal{O}(N^{2.055})$. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables the use of spectral filters and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) designed for positive graphs on signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Weighted DAG Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of learning the topology of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from nodal observations, which adhere to a linear structural equation model. Recent advances framed the combinatorial DAG structure learning task as a continuous optimization problem, yet existing methods must contend with the complexities of non-convex optimization. To overcome this limitation, we assume that the latent DAG contains only non-negative edge weights. Leveraging this additional structure, we argue that cycles can be effectively characterized (and prevented) using a convex acyclicity function based on the log-determinant of the adjacency matrix. This convexity allows us to relax the task of learning the non-negative weighted DAG as an abstract convex optimization problem. We propose a DAG recovery algorithm based on the method of multipliers, that is guaranteed to return a global minimizer. Furthermore, we prove that in the infinite sample size regime, the convexity of our approach ensures the recovery of the true DAG structure. We empirically validate the performance of our algorithm in several reproducible synthetic-data test cases, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an algorithm for Quantum Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (QIFFT) is developed to work for quantum data. Analogous to a classical discrete signal, a quantum signal can be represented in Dirac notation, application of QIFFT is a tensor transformation from frequency domain to time domain. If the tensors are merely complex entries, then we get the classical scenario. We have included the complete formulation of QIFFT algorithm from the classical model and have included butterfly diagram. QIFFT outperforms regular inversion of Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in terms of computational complexity, quantum parallelism and improved versatility.</description>

      <title>Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biosignal acquisition is key for healthcare applications and wearable devices, with machine learning offering promising methods for processing signals like surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be prepended to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperform standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study shows that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements, in line with sEMG physiological expectations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Prediction Model for NOx Emission of SCR System Based on Hybrid Data-driven Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming at the problem that delay time is difficult to determine and prediction accuracy is low in building prediction model of SCR system, a dynamic modeling scheme based on a hybrid of multiple data-driven algorithms was proposed. First, processed abnormal values and normalized the data. To improve the relevance of the input data, used MIC to estimate delay time and reconstructed production data. Then used combined feature selection method to determine input variables. To further mine data information, VMD was used to decompose input time series. Finally, established NOx emission prediction model combining ELM and EC model. Experimental results based on actual historical operating data show that the MAPE of predicted results is 2.61%. Model sensitivity analysis shows that besides the amount of ammonia injection, the inlet oxygen concentration and the flue gas temperature have a significant impact on NOx emission, which should be considered in SCR process control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Decentralized Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) in wireless systems is challenging due to noise, fading, and limited bandwidth, necessitating topology awareness, transmission scheduling, and the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) to mitigate interference and maintain reliable communications. These operations may result in substantial signaling overhead and scalability challenges in large networks lacking central coordination. This paper introduces a scalable DGD algorithm that eliminates the need for scheduling, topology information, or CSI (both average and instantaneous). At its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme that exploits a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. Nodes encode their local optimization signals into energy levels within an OFDM frame and transmit simultaneously, without coordination. The key insight is that the received energy equals, on average, the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals, scaled by their respective average channel gains, akin to a consensus step. This property enables unbiased consensus estimation, utilizing average channel gains as mixing weights, thereby removing the need for their explicit design or for CSI. Introducing a consensus stepsize mitigates consensus estimation errors due to energy fluctuations around their expected values. For strongly-convex problems, it is shown that the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes at a rate of O(1/sqrt{k}) after k iterations, with suitable decreasing learning and consensus stepsizes. Extensions accommodate a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical experiments on image classification demonstrate faster convergence in terms of running time compared to state-of-the-art schemes, especially in dense network scenarios.</description>

      <title>Short-term power load forecasting method based on CNN-SAEDN-Res</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network (SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network (FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data. Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks has brought new opportunities for the development of localization-based services. High-accuracy positioning use cases and functionalities defined by the standards are drawing the interest of vertical industries. In the transition towards the deployment, this paper aims to provide an in-depth tutorial on 5G positioning, summarizing the evolutionary path that led to the standardization of cellular-based positioning, describing the localization elements in current and forthcoming releases of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, and the major research trends. By providing fundamental notions on wireless localization, comprehensive definitions of measurements and architectures, examples of algorithms, and details on simulation approaches, this paper is intended to represent an exhaustive guide for researchers and practitioners. Our approach aims to merge practical aspects of enabled use cases and related requirements with theoretical methodologies and fundamental bounds, allowing to understand the trade-off between system complexity and achievable, i.e., tangible, benefits of 5G positioning services. We analyze the performance of 3GPP Rel-16 positioning by standard-compliant simulations in realistic outdoor and indoor propagation environments, investigating the impact of the system configuration and the limitations to be resolved for delivering accurate positioning solutions.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel, Data and Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new schemes for joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) and radar parameter estimation (RPE) in doubly-dispersive channels, such that integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is enabled by user equipment (UE) independently performing JCDE, and base stations (BSs) performing RPE. The contributed JCDE and RPE schemes are designed for waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive channels, under a unified model that captures the features of either legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), state-of-the-art (SotA) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and next-generation affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed JCDE algorithm is based on a Bayesian parametric bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (PBiGaBP) framework first proposed for OTFS and here shown to apply to all aforementioned waveforms, while the RPE scheme is based on a new probabilistic data association (PDA) approach incorporating a Bernoulli-Gaussian denoising, optimized via expectation maximization (EM). Simulation results demonstrate that JCDE in AFDM systems utilizing a single pilot per block significantly outperforms the SotA alternative even if the latter is granted a substantial power advantage. Similarly, the AFDM-based RPE scheme is found to outperform the OTFS-based approach, as well as the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) technique, regardless of the waveform used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation (5G/6G) wireless systems demand low-power mm-wave phased-array ICs. Variable-gain LNAs (VGLNAs) are key building blocks enabling hardware complexity reduction, performance enhancement and functionality extension. This paper reports a performance benchmarking of two low-power 30GHz VG-LNAs for phased-array ICs, which provide a 7.5dB gain control for 18dB Taylor taper in a 30GHz 8x8 antenna array, for a comprehensive validation of the new class of VGLNAs and its design methodology. In particular, this paper reports a second and implementation (VG-LNA2) with a reduced number (four) of gain-control back-gate voltages and super-low-Vt MOSFETs, with respect to the previous first implementation (VG-LNA1) with six gain-control back-gate voltages and regular- Vt MOSFETs, both in the same 22nm FDSOI CMOS technology. The results show that VG-LNA2 exhibits performance comparable to those of VG-LNA1, with a slightly lower power consumption. Overall, the performance benchmarking shows that the design methodology adopted for the new class of VG-LNAs leads to record low-power consumption and small form factor solutions reaching the targeted performances, regardless of the arrangements of the back-gate voltages for gain control and transistor sets, resulting in a comprehensive validation of the innovative design features and effective design methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.15600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real-time prediction of NOx emissions is of great significance for pollutant emission control and unit operation of coal-fired power plants. Aiming at dealing with the large time delay and strong nonlinear characteristics of the combustion process, a dynamic correction prediction model considering the time delay is proposed. First, the maximum information coefficient (MIC) is used to calculate the delay time between related parameters and NOx emissions, and the modeling data set is reconstructed; then, an adaptive feature selection algorithm based on Lasso and ReliefF is constructed to filter out the high correlation with NOx emissions. Parameters; Finally, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model combined with error correction was established to achieve the purpose of dynamically predicting the concentration of nitrogen oxides. Experimental results based on actual data show that the same variable has different delay times under load conditions such as rising, falling, and steady; and there are differences in model characteristic variables under different load conditions; dynamic error correction strategies effectively improve modeling accuracy; proposed The prediction error of the algorithm under different working conditions is less than 2%, which can accurately predict the NOx concentration at the combustion outlet, and provide guidance for NOx emission monitoring and combustion process optimization.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that 5G/6G networks will exploit sub-6 GHz, millimetre wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands simultaneously and will increase flexibility in user equipment (UE)-cell association. In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic geometry-based framework for the analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage in a multi-tier hybrid sub-6GHz-mmWave-THz network, where each tier has a particular base station (BS) density, transmit power, bandwidth, number of BS antennas, and cell-association bias factor. The proposed framework incorporates the effects of sub-6 GHz, mmWave and THz channel characteristics, BS beamforming gain, and blockages. We investigate the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled cell-association strategy and characterise the per-tier cell-association probability. Based on that, we analytically derive the SINR and rate coverage probabilities for both DL and UL transmissions. The analytical results are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy in terms of SINR and rate coverage over its coupled counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Neural electrical activity is fundamental to brain function, underlying a range of cognitive and behavioral processes, including movement, perception, decision-making, and consciousness. Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>DeRO: Dead Reckoning Based on Radar Odometry With Accelerometers Aided for Robot Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a radar odometry structure that directly utilizes radar velocity measurements for dead reckoning while maintaining its ability to update estimations within the Kalman filter framework. Specifically, we employ the Doppler velocity obtained by a 4D Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar in conjunction with gyroscope data to calculate poses. This approach helps mitigate high drift resulting from accelerometer biases and double integration. Instead, tilt angles measured by gravitational force are utilized alongside relative distance measurements from radar scan matching for the filter's measurement update. Additionally, to further enhance the system's accuracy, we estimate and compensate for the radar velocity scale factor. The performance of the proposed method is verified through five real-world open-source datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces position error by 62% and rotation error by 66% on average compared to the state-of-the-art radar-inertial fusion method in terms of absolute trajectory error.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Energy and SINR Coverage Probability in UAV Corridor-assisted RF-powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter studies the joint energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR)-based coverage probability in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The UAVs are spatially distributed in an aerial corridor that is modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) binomial point process (BPP). By accurately capturing the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of a UAV through large-scale fading i) an exact form expression for the energy coverage probability is derived, and ii) a tight approximation for the overall coverage performance is obtained. Among several key findings, numerical results reveal the optimal number of deployed UAV-BSs that maximizes the joint coverage probability, as well as the optimal length of the UAV corridors when designing such UAV-assisted IoT networks.</description>
