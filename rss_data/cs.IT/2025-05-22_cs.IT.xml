      <title>Movable Antenna Aided Full-Duplex ISAC System with Self-Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has shown significant potential for improving the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we model an MA-aided ISAC system operating in a communication full-duplex mono-static sensing framework. The self-interference channel is modeled as a function of the antenna position vectors under the near-field channel condition. We develop an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of downlink and uplink communication rates alongside the mutual information relevant to the sensing task. To address this highly non-convex problem, we employ the fractional programming (FP) method and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming, user power allocation, and antenna positions at the transceivers. Given the sensitivity of the AO-based algorithm to the initial antenna positions, a PSO-based algorithm is proposed to explore superior sub-optimal antenna positions within the feasible region. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms enable the MA system to effectively leverage the antenna position flexibility for accurate beamforming in a complex ISAC scenario. This enhances the system's self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities and markedly improves its overall performance and reliability compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>VisTopics: A Visual Semantic Unsupervised Approach to Topic Modeling of Video and Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding visual narratives is crucial for examining the evolving dynamics of media representation. This study introduces VisTopics, a computational framework designed to analyze large-scale visual datasets through an end-to-end pipeline encompassing frame extraction, deduplication, and semantic clustering. Applying VisTopics to a dataset of 452 NBC News videos resulted in reducing 11,070 frames to 6,928 deduplicated frames, which were then semantically analyzed to uncover 35 topics ranging from political events to environmental crises. By integrating Latent Dirichlet Allocation with caption-based semantic analysis, VisTopics demonstrates its potential to unravel patterns in visual framing across diverse contexts. This approach enables longitudinal studies and cross-platform comparisons, shedding light on the intersection of media, technology, and public discourse. The study validates the method's reliability through human coding accuracy metrics and emphasizes its scalability for communication research. By bridging the gap between visual representation and semantic meaning, VisTopics provides a transformative tool for advancing the methodological toolkit in computational media studies. Future research may leverage VisTopics for comparative analyses across media outlets or geographic regions, offering insights into the shifting landscapes of media narratives and their societal implications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems with QoS Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas have recently garnered significant attention due to their ability to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments. Despite notable advancements in this area, the exploration of energy efficiency (EE) maximization in pinching-antenna systems remains relatively underdeveloped. In this paper, we address the EE maximization problem in a downlink time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based multi-user system employing one waveguide and multiple pinching antennas, where each user is subject to a minimum rate constraint to ensure quality-of-service. The formulated optimization problem jointly considers transmit power and time allocations as well as the positioning of pinching antennas, resulting in a non-convex problem. To tackle this challenge, we first obtain the optimal positions of the pinching antennas. Based on this, we establish a feasibility condition for the system. Subsequently, the joint power and time allocation problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which are solved iteratively until convergence. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is addressed through an iterative approach, where a semi-analytical solution is obtained in each iteration. Likewise, a semi-analytical solution is derived for the time allocation subproblem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed pinching-antenna-based strategy significantly outperforms both conventional fixed-antenna systems and other benchmark pinching-antenna schemes in terms of EE.</description>

      <title>Sequential Interval Passing for Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited set of measurements poses a significant challenge as it necessitates a solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations. Compressed sensing (CS) deals with sparse signal reconstruction using techniques such as linear programming (LP) and iterative message passing schemes. The interval passing algorithm (IPA) is an attractive CS approach due to its low complexity when compared to LP. In this paper, we propose a sequential IPA that is inspired by sequential belief propagation decoding of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes used for forward error correction in channel coding. In the sequential setting, each check node (CN) in the Tanner graph of an LDPC measurement matrix is scheduled one at a time in every iteration, as opposed to the standard ``flooding'' interval passing approach in which all CNs are scheduled at once per iteration. The sequential scheme offers a significantly lower message passing complexity compared to flooding IPA on average, and for some measurement matrix and signal sparsity, a complexity reduction of 36% is achieved. We show both analytically and numerically that the reconstruction accuracy of the IPA is not compromised by adopting our sequential scheduling approach.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System under Spatially-Correlated Rician Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are among the most promising technologies for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. Unlike traditional fixed-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a FAS possesses position reconfigurability to switch on-demand among $N$ predefined ports over a prescribed space. This paper explores the performance of a single-input single-output (SISO) model with a fixed-position antenna transmitter and a single-antenna FAS receiver, referred to as the Rx-SISO-FAS model, under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels. Our contributions include exact expressions and closed-form bounds for the outage probability of the Rx-SISO-FAS model, as well as exact and closed-form lower bounds for the ergodic rate. Importantly, we also analyze the performance considering both uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform planar array (UPA) configurations for the ports of the FAS. To gain insights, we evaluate the diversity order of the proposed model and our analytical results indicate that with a fixed overall system size, increasing the number of ports, $N$, significantly decreases the outage performance of FAS under different Rician fading factors. Our numerical results further demonstrate that: $i)$ the Rx-SISO-FAS model can enhance performance under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels over the fixed-position antenna counterpart; $ii)$ the Rician factor negatively impacts performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime; $iii$) FAS can outperform an $L$ branches maximum ratio combining (MRC) system under Rician fading channels; and $iv)$ when the number of ports is identical, UPA outperforms ULA.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Multiple Active RISs for 5G MIMO Commercial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerous experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, most have primarily focused on extending coverage. In contrast, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of multiple active RISs deployed in a 5G multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) commercial network, emphasizing enhancements in channel rank and throughput. We propose a low-complexity, codebook-based beamforming algorithm specifically tailored for multi-RIS configurations, which diversifies directional channels and reduces reliance on explicit channel state information. Field tests using a commercial base station and user equipment reveal that the multi-RIS system can improve channel rank and throughput by up to 14% compared to single-RIS deployments, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings underscore the practical benefits of active multi-RIS systems for next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in Coherent Optical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber nonlinearity represents a critical challenge to the capacity enhancement of modern optical communication systems. In recent years, significant research efforts have focused on mitigating its impact through two complementary approaches. On the one hand, researchers have investigated practical digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to mitigate or compensate for nonlinear impairments, such as reversing fiber propagation effects through digital backpropagation (DBP). However, the high computational complexity of these techniques often discourages their practical implementation. On the other hand, information-theoretic studies have sought to establish the capacity limits of the nonlinear optical fiber channel, providing a framework for evaluating the ultimate performance of existing optical networks and guiding the design of next-generation systems. This work reviews recent advances and proposes future directions for nonlinearity compensation and mitigation, including constellation shaping techniques and low-complexity DBP. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of these innovations both in advancing the theoretical understanding of fiber capacity limits and in enabling practical DSP implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is an inverse problem that, on one hand, is crucial in many applications across imaging and physics, and, on the other hand, leads to deep research questions in theoretical signal processing and applied harmonic analysis. This survey paper is an outcome of the recent workshop Phase Retrieval in Mathematics and Applications (PRiMA) (held on August 5--9 2024 at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, The Netherlands) that brought together experts working on theoretical and practical aspects of the phase retrieval problem with the purpose to formulate and explore essential open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Classical Pipeline for X Ray Based Fracture Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bone fractures are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Traditional X ray interpretation is time consuming and error prone, while existing machine learning and deep learning solutions often demand extensive feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and high computational resources. To address these challenges, a distributed hybrid quantum classical pipeline is proposed that first applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then leverages a 4 qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. By fusing eight PCA derived features with eight quantum enhanced features into a 16 dimensional vector and then classifying with different machine learning models achieving 99% accuracy using a public multi region X ray dataset on par with state of the art transfer learning models while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.</description>

      <title>Improved Classical Shadow Tomography Using Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography (CST) involves obtaining enough classical descriptions of an unknown state via quantum measurements to predict the outcome of a set of quantum observables. CST has numerous applications, particularly in algorithms that utilize quantum data for tasks such as learning, detection, and optimization. This paper introduces a new CST procedure that exponentially reduces the space complexity and quadratically improves the running time of CST with single-copy measurements. The approach utilizes a quantum-to-classical-to-quantum process to prepare quantum states that represent shadow snapshots, which can then be directly measured by the observables of interest. With that, calculating large matrix traces is avoided, resulting in improvements in running time and space complexity. The paper presents analyses of the proposed methods for CST, with Pauli measurements and Clifford circuits.</description>

      <title>Cost-aware LLM-based Online Dataset Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Quantum Contraction and Correlation Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the maximal correlation coefficient is used to establish strong limits on distributed processing. Through its relation to the $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficient, it also establishes fundamental bounds on sequential processing. Two distinct quantum extensions of the maximal correlation coefficient have been introduced to recover these two scenarios, but they do not recover the entire classical framework. We introduce a family of non-commutative $L^{2}(p)$ spaces induced by operator monotone functions from which families of quantum maximal correlation coefficients and the quantum $\chi^{2}$-divergences can be identified. Through this framework, we lift the classical results to the quantum setting. For distributed processing, using our quantum maximal correlation coefficients, we establish strong limits on converting quantum states under local operations. For sequential processing, we clarify the relation between the data processing inequality of quantum maximal correlation coefficients, $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients, and $f$-divergences. Moreover, we establish the quantum maximal correlation coefficients and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients are often computable via linear algebraic methods, which in particular implies a method for obtaining rigorous, computable upper bounds for time-homogeneous quantum Markov chains with a unique, full rank fixed point.</description>

      <title>Laplace Sample Information: Data Informativeness Through a Bayesian Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection, which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI) measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes and transfers well to the training of large models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Mobile Environment for Vehicular Visible Light Communication Using Multiple LEDs and Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), sensors that serve as the ``eyes'' for sensing the vehicle's surrounding environment are essential. Traditionally, image sensors and LiDAR have played this role. However, a new type of vision sensor, event cameras, has recently attracted attention. Event cameras respond to changes in the surrounding environment (e.g., motion), exhibit strong robustness against motion blur, and perform well in high dynamic range environments, which are desirable in robotics applications. Furthermore, the asynchronous and low-latency principles of data acquisition make event cameras suitable for optical communication. By adding communication functionality to event cameras, it becomes possible to utilize I2V communication to immediately share information about forward collisions, sudden braking, and road conditions, thereby contributing to hazard avoidance. Additionally, receiving information such as signal timing and traffic volume enables speed adjustment and optimal route selection, facilitating more efficient driving. In this study, we construct a vehicle visible light communication system where event cameras are receivers, and multiple LEDs are transmitters. In driving scenes, the system tracks the transmitter positions and separates densely packed LED light sources using pilot sequences based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. As a result, outdoor vehicle experiments demonstrate error-free communication under conditions where the transmitter-receiver distance was within 40 meters and the vehicle's driving speed was 30 km/h (8.3 m/s).</description>

      <title>Optimal Best-Arm Identification under Fixed Confidence with Multiple Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal, its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.</description>

      <title>Multibeam Satellite Communications with Massive MIMO: Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve high performance without substantial overheads associated with channel state information (CSI) of ground users, we consider a fixed-beam precoding approach, where a satellite forms multiple fixed-beams without relying on CSI, then select a suitable user set for each beam. Upon this precoding method, we put forth a satellite equipped with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), by which inter-beam interference is efficiently mitigated by narrowing corresponding beam width. By modeling the ground users' locations via a Poisson point process, we rigorously analyze the achievable performance of the presented multibeam satellite system. In particular, we investigate the asymptotic scaling laws that reveal the interplay between the user density, the number of beams, and the number of antennas. Our analysis offers critical design insights for the multibeam satellite with massive MIMO: i) If the user density scales in power with the number of antennas, the considered precoding can achieve a linear fraction of the optimal rate in the asymptotic regime. ii) A certain additional scaling factor for the user density is needed as the number of beams increases to maintain the asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the \emph{semantics of information} and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term \textit{state-dependent} costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated as a \emph{constrained Markov decision process} (CMDP). We show that the optimal Lagrangian cost follows a piece-wise linear and concave (PWLC) function, and the optimal policy is, at most, a randomized mixture of two simple deterministic policies. By exploiting the structural results, we develop a new \textit{intersection search} algorithm that finds the optimal policy using only a few iterations. We further propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to compute the optimal policy without knowing \textit{a priori} the channel and source statistics. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality" in MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) algorithm. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial-decode forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial-decode forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>
