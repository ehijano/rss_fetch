      <title>Effects of Quadratic Optomechanical Coupling on Bipartite Entanglements, Mechanical Ground-State Cooling and Squeezing in an Electro-Optomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the steady-state bipartite entanglements, mechanical ground-state cooling, and mechanical quadrature squeezing in a hybrid electro-optomechanical system where a moving membrane is linearly coupled to the microwave field mode of an LC circuit, while it simultaneously interacts both linearly and quadratically with the radiation pressure of a single-mode optical cavity. We show that by choosing a suitable sign and amplitude for the quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC), one can achieve enhanced and thermally robust stationary bipartite entanglement between the subsystems, improved mechanical ground-state cooling, and Q-quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode beyond the 3-dB limit of squeezing. In particular, we find that in the presence of QOC with positive sign the bipartite optical-microwave entanglement can be increased by about 2.25 times around the temperature of 1mK, and it can be preserved against thermal noise up to the ambient temperature of 90mK. Furthermore, the QOC with positive sign can give rise to the enhancement of the mechanical ground-state cooling by about 1 order of magnitude in the optical and microwave red-detuned regime. We also find that for the positive sign of QOC and near the microwave resonance frequency the squeezing degree of the Q-quadrature of the mechanical mode can be amplified up to 7 dB. Such a hybrid electro-optomechanical system can serve as a promising platform to engineer an improved optical-microwave entangled source for microwave sensing as well as quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Non-variational Quantum Walk-based Optimisation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces in detail a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems, including constrained problems and problems with non-binary variables. The algorithm returns optimal and near-optimal solutions from repeated preparation and measurement of an amplified state. The amplified state is prepared via repeated application of two unitaries; one which phase-shifts solution states dependent on objective function values, and the other which mixes phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific mixing graph. The general interference process responsible for amplifying optimal solutions is derived in part from statistical analysis of objective function values as distributed over the mixing graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems: weighted maxcut, k-means clustering, quadratic assignment, maximum independent set and capacitated facility location. In all cases, efficient circuit implementations of the CTQWs are discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. For each of the considered problems, the algorithm's performance is simulated for a randomly generated problem instance, and in each case, the amplified state produces a globally optimal solution within a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>The probabilistic world II : Quantum mechanics from classical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses simple examples how quantum systems are obtained as subsystems of classical statistical systems. For a single qubit with arbitrary Hamiltonian and for the quantum particle in a harmonic potential we provide explicitly all steps how these quantum systems follow from an overall ''classical" probability distribution for events at all times. This overall probability distribution is the analogue of Feynman's functional integral for quantum mechanics or for the functional integral defining a quantum field theory. In our case the action and associated weight factor are real, however, defining a classical probabilistic system. Nevertheless, a unitary time-evolution of wave functions can be realized for suitable systems, in particular probabilistic automata. Based on these insights we discuss novel aspects for correlated computing not requiring the extreme isolation of quantum computers. A simple neuromorphic computer based on neurons in an active or quiet state within a probabilistic environment can learn the unitary transformations of an entangled two-qubit system. Our explicit constructions constitute a proof that no-go theorems for the embedding of quantum mechanics in classical statistics are circumvented. We show in detail how subsystems of classical statistical systems can explain various ``quantum mysteries". Conceptually our approach is a straightforward derivation starting from an overall probability distribution without invoking non-locality, acausality, contextuality, many worlds or other additional concepts. All quantum laws follow directly from the standard properties of classical probabilities.</description>

      <title>A solution of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the generalised quantum Stein's lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $n$ copies of an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ and a generic separable state $\sigma_{A^n:B^n}$, equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of the theory of entanglement manipulation under asymptotically non-entangling operations, with the regularised relative entropy of entanglement governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call "blurring", which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. In the fully classical case, blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma. To solve the quantum problem, however, it does not seem to suffice. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.</description>

      <title>Heat as a witness of quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for witnessing quantum resources, including entanglement and coherence, based on heat generation. Inspired by the concept of Maxwell's demon, we analyze the heat exchange between a quantum system and a thermal environment assisted by a quantum memory. By exploring the fundamental limitations of heat transfer in this scenario, we find that quantum states can reveal their non-classical signatures via energy exchange with a thermal environment. This approach offers a promising alternative to complex, system-specific measurements, as it relies solely on fixed energy measurements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to the detection of entanglement in isotropic states and coherence in a two-spin system interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Design and architecture of the IBM Quantum Engine Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe the design and architecture of the open-source Quantum Engine Compiler (qe-compiler) currently used in production for IBM Quantum systems. The qe-compiler is built using LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) framework and includes definitions for several dialects to represent parameterized quantum computation at multiple levels of abstraction. The compiler also provides Python bindings and a diagnostic system. An open-source LALR lexer and parser built using Bison and Flex generates an Abstract Syntax Tree that is translated to a high-level MLIR dialect. An extensible hierarchical target system for modeling the heterogeneous nature of control systems at compilation time is included. Target-based and generic compilation passes are added using a pipeline interface to translate the input down to low-level intermediate representations (including LLVM IR) and can take advantage of LLVM backends and tooling to generate machine executable binaries. The qe-compiler is built to be extensible, maintainable, performant, and scalable to support the future of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials on the Unit Circle, Mutually Unbiased Bases, and Balanced States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two interesting phenomena for the construction of quantum states are that of mutually unbiased bases and that of balanced states. We explore a constructive approach to each phenomenon that involves orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. In the case of mutually unbiased bases, we show that this approach does not produce such bases. In the case of balanced states, we provide examples of pairs of orthonormal bases and states that are balanced with respect to them. We also consider extensions of these ideas to the infinite dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a CAFQA-bootstrapped Variational Quantum Eigensolver on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the CAFQA method can utilize classical computational capabilities to identify a better initial state than the Hartree-Fock method. Previous research has demonstrated that the initial state provided by CAFQA recovers more correlation energy than that of the Hartree-Fock method and results in faster convergence. In the present study, we advance the investigation of CAFQA by demonstrating its advantages on a high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum computer located at the Duke Quantum Center -- this is the first experimental demonstration of CAFQA-bootstrapped VQE on a TI device and on any academic quantum device. In our VQE experiment, we use LiH and BeH$_2$ as test cases to show that CAFQA achieves faster convergence and obtains lower energy values within the specified computational budget limits. To ensure the seamless execution of VQE on this academic device, we develop a novel hardware-software interface framework that supports independent software environments for both the circuit and hardware end. This mechanism facilitates the automation of VQE-type job executions as well as mitigates the impact of random hardware interruptions. This framework is versatile and can be applied to a variety of academic quantum devices beyond the trapped-ion quantum computer platform, with support for integration with customized packages.</description>

      <title>Quantum information with quantum-like bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we have proposed a construction of quantum-like bits that could endow a large, complex classical system, for example of oscillators, with quantum-like function that is not compromised by decoherence. In the present paper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. Firstly, we discuss a general protocol on how to construct synchronizing networks that allow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those states. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like computing on specially-constructed classical networks. Finally, we define a notion of measurement that allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that separates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to explore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources, and shows how arbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating emergent states in those systems.</description>

      <title>Out of the Loop: Structural Approximation of Optimisation Landscapes and non-Iterative Quantum Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06493v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (qaoa) is a widely studied quantum-classical iterative heuristic for combinatorial optimisation. While qaoa targets problems in complexity class NP, the classical optimisation procedure required in every iteration is itself known to be NP-hard. Still, advantage over classical approaches is suspected for certain scenarios, but nature and origin of its computational power are not yet satisfactorily understood. By introducing means of efficiently and accurately approximating the qaoa optimisation landscape from solution space structures, we derive a new algorithmic variant: Instead of performing an iterative quantum-classical computation for each input instance, our non-iterative method is based on a quantum circuit that is instance-independent, but problem-specific. It matches or outperforms unit-depth qaoa for key combinatorial problems, despite reduced computational effort. Our approach is based on proving a long-standing conjecture regarding instance-independent structures in qaoa. By ensuring generality, we link existing empirical observations on qaoa parameter clustering to established approaches in theoretical computer science, and provide a sound foundation for understanding the link between structural properties of solution spaces and quantum optimisation.</description>

      <title>Motional sideband asymmetry of a solid-state mechanical resonator at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motional sideband asymmetry of a mechanical oscillator interacting with a laser field can be observed when approaching the quantum ground state, where the zero-point energy of the mechanical oscillator becomes a sizable contribution to its motion. In the context of quantum optomechanics, it allows, in principle, calibration-free inference of the thermal equilibrium of a macroscopic mechanical resonator with its optical bath. At room temperature, this phenomenon has been observed in pioneering experiments using levitated nanoparticles. Measuring this effect with solid-state mechanical resonators has been compounded by thermal intermodulation noise, mirror frequency noise and low quantum cooperativity. Here, we sideband-cool a membrane-in-the-middle system close to the quantum ground state from room temperature, and observe motional sideband asymmetry in a dual-homodyne measurement. Sideband thermometry yields a minimum phonon occupancy of $\bar{n}_{eff}=9.5$. Our work provides insights into nonlinear optomechanical dynamics at room temperature and facilitates accessible optomechanical quantum technologies without the need for complex feedback control and cryogenic cooling.</description>

      <title>From Graphs to Qubits: A Critical Review of Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) represent a novel fusion of quantum computing and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), aimed at overcoming the computational and scalability challenges inherent in classical GNNs that are powerful tools for analyzing data with complex relational structures but suffer from limitations such as high computational complexity and over-smoothing in large-scale applications. Quantum computing, leveraging principles like superposition and entanglement, offers a pathway to enhanced computational capabilities. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art in QGNNs, exploring various architectures. We discuss their applications across diverse fields such as high-energy physics, molecular chemistry, finance and earth sciences, highlighting the potential for quantum advantage. Additionally, we address the significant challenges faced by QGNNs, including noise, decoherence, and scalability issues, proposing potential strategies to mitigate these problems. This comprehensive review aims to provide a foundational understanding of QGNNs, fostering further research and development in this promising interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence principle bridges the quantum and classical worlds by establishing a direct link between their dynamics. This well-accepted tenant of quantum physics has been explored in quantum systems wherein the number of particles is increased to macroscopic scales. However, theoretical investigations of nanoscale structures have revealed discrepancies when attempting to bridge classical and quantum physics. Here, we report on the experimental observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in open many-body optical systems. We demonstrate, for the first time, the lack of classical-to-quantum correspondence between a macroscopic optical system and its constituent quantum multiphoton subsystems. In contrast to common belief, we demonstrate that the coherence dynamics of many-body quantum subsystems with up to forty particles can indeed be opposite to that exhibited by the hosting macroscopic system. By employing complex-Gaussian statistics, we show that these effects are universal for open many-body systems. Consequently, our work can have important implications for other fields of physics ranging from condensed matter to nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Elementary Quantum Arithmetic Logic Units for Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic logic units (QALUs) constitute a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, the implementation of QALUs on near-term quantum computers remains a substantial challenge, largely due to the limited connectivity of qubits. In this paper, we propose feasible QALUs, including quantum binary adders, subtractors, multipliers, and dividers, which are designed for near-term quantum computers with qubits arranged in two-dimensional arrays. Additionally, we introduce a feasible quantum arithmetic operation to compute the two's complement representation of signed integers. The proposed QALUs utilize only Pauli-X gates, CNOT gates, and $C\sqrt{X}$ (CSX) gates, and all two-qubit gates are operated between nearest neighbor qubits. Our work demonstrates a viable implementation of QALUs on near-term quantum computers, advancing towards scalable and resource-efficient quantum arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Iterative quantum optimization of spin glass problems with rapidly oscillating transverse fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new iterative quantum algorithm, called Iterative Symphonic Tunneling for Satisfiability problems (IST-SAT), which solves quantum spin glass optimization problems using high-frequency oscillating transverse fields. IST-SAT operates as a sequence of iterations, in which bitstrings returned from one iteration are used to set spin-dependent phases in oscillating transverse fields in the next iteration. Over several iterations, the novel mechanism of the algorithm steers the system toward the problem ground state. We benchmark IST-SAT on sets of hard MAX-3-XORSAT problem instances with exact state vector simulation, and report polynomial speedups over trotterized adiabatic quantum computation (TAQC) and the best known semi-greedy classical algorithm. When IST-SAT is seeded with a sufficiently good initial approximation, the algorithm converges to exact solution(s) in a polynomial number of iterations. Our numerical results identify a critial Hamming radius(CHR), or quality of initial approximation, where the time-to-solution crosses from exponential to polynomial scaling in problem size. By combining IST-SAT with future classical or quantum approximation algorithms, larger gains may be achieved. The mechanism we present in this work thus presents a new path toward achieving quantum advantage in optimization.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-secured optical channels based on Quantum Key Distribution technology have generated a significant global interest. Although the maturity level of the short distance (less than 100 km) quantum-secured channels is at a deployment level, instituting such channels over long distance faces technological challenges, which is the subject of a world-wide research. In this article an industry perspective on establishing quantum-secured channels in large-scale optical networks in operational environments will be discussed, including the vision, requirements, and technical analysis of different approaches for establishing such channels.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed circuits and fewer measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced induced coherence without induced emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study of the enhancement of Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) interferometry through cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) processes producing frequency-entangled biphotons. The ZWM interferometry shows the capability to generate interference effects between single signal photons via indistinguishability between the entangled idler photons. This paper extends the foundational principles of ZWM interferometry by integrating cavity-enhanced SPDCs, aiming to narrow photon bandwidths for improved coherence and photon pair generation efficiency, which is critical for applications in quantum information technologies, quantum encryption, and quantum imaging. This work explores the theoretical implication of employing singly resonant optical parametric oscillators within the ZWM interferometer to produce narrow-band single photons. By combining cavity-enhanced SPDCs with ZWM interferometry, this study fills a gap in current theoretical proposals, offering significant advancements in quantum cryptography and network applications that require reliable, narrow-band single photons.</description>

      <title>Attainability of quantum state discrimination bounds with collective measurements on finite copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics is that non-orthogonal states cannot be distinguished perfectly. When distinguishing multiple copies of a mixed quantum state, a collective measurement, which generates entanglement between the different copies of the unknown state, can achieve a lower error probability than non-entangling measurements. The error probability that can be attained using a collective measurement on a finite number of copies of the unknown state is given by the Helstrom bound. In the limit where we can perform a collective measurement on asymptotically many copies of the quantum state, the quantum Chernoff bound gives the attainable error probability. It is natural to ask at what rate does the error tend to this asymptotic limit, and whether the asymptotic limit can be attained for any finite number of copies. In this paper we address these questions. We find analytic expressions for the Helstrom bound for arbitrarily many copies of the unknown state in several simple qubit examples. Using these analytic expressions, we investigate how the attainable error rate changes as we allow collective measurements on finite numbers of copies of the quantum state. We also investigate the necessary conditions to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound. It is known that a collective measurement on all M-copies of the unknown state is always sufficient to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound. However, general conditions for when such a measurement is necessary to saturate the Helstrom bound remain unknown. We investigate specific measurement strategies which involve entangling operations on fewer than all M-copies of the unknown state. For many regimes we find that a collective measurement on all M-copies of the unknown state is necessary to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally-bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers, as well as complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum cloning transformation unlocks the potential of W class of states in a secret sharing protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems is to share a secret because the sender does not trust the receiver completely. Thus, the sender provides one part of the information to the receiver and shares the other part of the information to a third party on whom the sender can rely. The secret can be revealed when the receiver and the third party agree to cooperate. This is the essence of the secret-sharing protocol. A lot of studies have been done on it using the three-qubit GHZ state, and only a few works have involved the W state. In this work, we introduce a quantum secret sharing protocol exploiting a three-qubit W class of state shared between three parties, Alice (Sender), Bob (Mediator), and Charlie (Receiver). In the proposed protocol, the shared state parameters and the secret are linked in such a way that it is very difficult to factor them. We will show that these parameters can be factored out easily if the receiver uses a quantum cloning machine (QCM) and thus can retrieve the secret. We find that the protocol is probabilistic and have calculated the probability of success of the protocol. Further, we establish the relation between the success probability and the efficiency of the QCM. In general, we find that the efficiency of the constructed QCM is greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{3}$, but we have shown that its efficiency can be enhanced when the parameters of the shared state are used as the parameters of the QCM. Moreover, we derived the linkage between the probability of success and the amount of entanglement in the shared W class of state. We analyzed the obtained result and found that even a less entangled W class of state can also play a vital role in the proposed secret-sharing scheme.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize this promise, new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power.

      <title>From Maximum Cut to Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem could be naturally expressed either in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, or as an Ising model. It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem could also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural to attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this strategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a benchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further development of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the corresponding coding problems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of a levitated sub-mg ferromagnetic cube in a planar alternating-current magnetic Paul trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic levitated objects are a promising platform for inertial sensing, testing gravity at small scales, optomechanics in the quantum regime, and large-mass superpositions. However, existing levitation techniques harnessing optical and electrical fields suffer from noise induced by elevated internal temperatures and charge noise, respectively. Meissner-based magnetic levitation circumvents both sources of decoherence but requires cryogenic environments. Here we characterize a sub-mg ferromagnetic cube levitated in an alternating-current planar magnetic Paul trap at room temperature. We show behavior in line with the Mathieu equations and quality factors of up to 2500 for the librational modes. Besides technological sensing applications, this technique sets out a path for MHz librational modes in the micron-sized particle limit, allowing for magnetic coupling to superconducting circuits and spin-based quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Speed Limits and Scrambling in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Krylov complexity and operator quantum speed limits (OQSLs) of the complexity operator and level repulsion in random/integrable matrices and many-body systems. An enhanced level-repulsion corresponds to increased OQSLs in random/integrable matrices. However, in many-body systems, the dynamics is more intricate due to the tensor product structure of the models. Initially, as the integrability-breaking parameter increases, the OQSL also increases, suggesting that breaking integrability allows for faster evolution of the complexity operator. At larger values of integrability-breaking, the OQSL decreases, suggesting a slowdown in the operator's evolution speed. Information-theoretic properties, such as scrambling, coherence and entanglement, of Krylov basis operators in many-body systems, are also investigated. The scrambling behaviour of these operators exhibits distinct patterns in integrable and chaotic cases. For systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, the Krylov basis operators remain a reliable measure of these properties of the time-evolved operator at late times. However, in integrable systems, the Krylov operator's ability to capture the entanglement dynamics is less effective, especially during late times.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <title>Stationary states of boundary driven quantum systems: some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-dimensional open quantum systems whose density matrix evolves via a Lindbladian, $\dot{\rho}=-i[H,\rho]+{\mathcal D}\rho$. Here $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the isolated system and ${\mathcal D}$ is the dissipator. We consider the case where the system consists of two parts, the "boundary'' $A$ and the ``bulk'' $B$, and ${\mathcal D}$ acts only on $A$, so ${\mathcal D}={\mathcal D}_A\otimes{\mathcal I}_B$, where ${\mathcal D}_A$ acts only on part $A$, while ${\mathcal I}_B$ is the identity superoperator on part $B$. Let ${\mathcal D}_A$ be ergodic, so ${\mathcal D}_A\hat{\rho}_A=0$ only for one unique density matrix $\hat{\rho}_A$. We show that any stationary density matrix $\bar{\rho}$ on the full system which commutes with $H$ must be of the product form $\bar{\rho}=\hat{\rho}_A\otimes\rho_B$ for some $\rho_B$. This rules out finding any ${\mathcal D}_A$ that has the Gibbs measure $\rho_\beta\sim e^{-\beta H}$ as a stationary state with $\beta\neq 0$, unless there is no interaction between parts $A$ and $B$. We give criteria for the uniqueness of the stationary state $\bar{\rho}$ for systems with interactions between $A$ and $B$. Related results for non-ergodic cases are also discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate numerically the survival probability $P(t)$ for the unstable 2P excited state of the hydrogen atom, which decays into the ground-state 1S emitting one photon ($\tau \sim 1.595$ ns), thus extending the analytic study of Facchi and Pascazio, Physics Letters A 241 (1998). To this end, we first determine the analytic expression of the spectral function of the unstable state, which allows for an accurate evaluation of $P(t)$. As expected, for short and long times $P(t)$ shows deviations from the exponential law: a `Zeno' region occurs at extremely short times (up to $\sim 0.3$ attosec, followed by a longer `anti-Zeno' domain (up to $\sim 50$ attosec); at long times above $125 \tau$, the decay law scales as $t^{-4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric control of quantum spin chains has been an outstanding goal for the few last years due to its potential use in technologies related to quantum information processing. In this work, we show the feasibility of the different steps necessary to perform controlled quantum state transfer in a $S=1/2$ titanium atoms chain employing the electric field produced by a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). Our results show that the initialization and transmission of a single excitation state is achievable in short times, and with high fidelity. Our study uses spin Hamiltonians to model the magnetic atoms chain, the tip of the STM, the interaction between it and the atoms chain and the electronic response to the fields applied by the tip, employing sets of parameters compatible with the latest experiments and ab initio calculations. The time dynamical evolution is considered in the full Hilbert space and the control pulses frequencies exerted by the tip of the microscope are within the reach of present day technology.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layered Security System: Integrating Quantum Key Distribution with Classical Cryptography to Enhance Steganographic Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel cryptographic system that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with classical encryption techniques to secure steganographic images. Our approach leverages the E91 QKD protocol to generate a shared secret key between communicating parties, ensuring the highest level of security against eavesdropping through the principles of quantum mechanics. This key is then hashed using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to provide a fixedlength, high-entropy key, which is subsequently utilized in symmetric encryption. We explore the use of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithms for encrypting steganographic images, which hide sensitive information within digital images to provide an additional layer of security through obscurity. The combination of QKD, hashing, and symmetric encryption offers a robust security framework that mitigates various attack vectors, enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, highlighting its performance in terms of key generation rates, encryption/decryption speeds, and the computational overhead introduced by the hashing and steganographic processes. By integrating quantum and classical cryptographic methods with steganography, this work provides a comprehensive security solution that is highly resistant to both quantum and classical attacks, making it suitable for applications requiring stringent security measures. This paper contributes to the ongoing research in cryptographic systems, offering insights into the practical implementation and potential benefits of hybrid quantumclassical security protocols.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [40] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [30, 37, 46, 61].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [39]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting de Broglie's Double-Solution Pilot-Wave Theory with a Lorentz-Covariant Lagrangian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between de Broglie's double-solution approach to quantum dynamics and the hydrodynamic pilot-wave system has motivated a number of recent revisitations and extensions of de Broglie's theory. Building upon these recent developments, we here introduce a rich family of pilot-wave systems, with a view to reformulating and studying de Broglie's double-solution program in the modern language of classical field theory. Notably, the entire family is local and Lorentz-invariant, follows from a variational principle, and exhibits time-invariant, two-way coupling between particle and pilot-wave field. We first introduce a variational framework for generic pilot-wave systems, including a derivation of particle-wave exchange of Noether currents. We then focus on a particular limit of our system, in which the particle is propelled by the local gradient of its pilot wave. In this case, we see that the Compton-scale oscillations proposed by de Broglie emerge naturally in the form of particle vibrations, and that the vibration modes dynamically adjust to match the Compton frequency in the rest frame of the particle. The underlying field dynamically changes its radiation patterns in order to satisfy the de Broglie relation $p=\hbar k$ at the particle's position, even as the particle momentum $p$ changes. The wave form and frequency thus evolve so as to conform to de Broglie's "harmony of phases", even for unsteady particle motion. We show that the particle is always dressed with a Compton-scale Yukawa wavepacket, independent of its trajectory, and that the associated energy imparts a constant increase to the particle's inertial mass. Finally, we see that the particle's wave-induced Compton-scale oscillation gives rise to a classical version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Grover's Algorithm in the classical rainbow table, uncovering the potential of integrating quantum computing techniques with conventional cryptographic methods to develop a Quantum Rainbow Table Proof-of-Concept. This leverages on Quantum concepts and algorithms which includes the principle of qubit superposition, entanglement and teleportation, coupled with Grover's Algorithm to enable a more efficient search through the rainbow table. The paper also details on the hardware constraints and the work around to produce better results in the implementation stages. Through this work we develop a working prototype of quantum rainbow table and demonstrate how quantum computing could significantly improve the speed of cyber tools such as password crackers and thus impact the cyber security landscape.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Message-Passing for the Scalable Decoding of QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Astra, a novel and scalable decoder using graph neural networks. Our decoder works similarly to solving a Sudoku puzzle of constraints represented by the Tanner graph. In general, QLDPC decoding is based on belief propagation (BP, a variant of message-passing) and requires time intensive post-processing methods such as ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Without using any post-processing, Astra achieves higher thresholds and better logical error rates when compared to BP+OSD, both for surface codes trained up to distance 11 and Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes trained up to distance 18. Moreover, we can successfully extrapolate the decoding functionality: we decode high distances by using decoders trained on lower distances. Astra+OSD is faster than BP+OSD. We show that with decreasing physical error rates, Astra+OSD makes progressively fewer calls to OSD when compared to BP+OSD, even in the context of extrapolated decoding. Astra(+OSD) achieves orders of magnitude lower logical error rates for BB codes compared to BP(+OSD). The source code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/arshpreetmaan/astra}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in fueling many quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. This is due to the need to precisely characterise many-copy, asymptotic protocols for entanglement processing. Here we overcome these issues by introducing a new way of benchmarking the fundamental protocol of entanglement distillation (purification), where instead of measuring its asymptotic yield, we focus on the best achievable error. We connect this formulation of the task with an information-theoretic problem in composite quantum hypothesis testing known as generalised Sanov's theorem. By solving the latter problem -- which had no previously known solution even in classical information theory -- we thus compute the optimal asymptotic error exponent of entanglement distillation. We show this asymptotic solution to be given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state, which is a unique feature among operational measures of entanglement. Altogether, we thus demonstrate a measure of entanglement that admits a direct operational interpretation as the optimal asymptotic rate of an important entanglement manipulation protocol while enjoying an exact, single-letter formula.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for low-noise detection of atoms using resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy in cold atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy has been used as a highly-sensitive method for measuring the output of cold-atom interferometers. Using a detailed model that accounts for optical saturation, spatially-varying intensities and atomic densities, and radiation pressure on the atoms, we theoretically investigate under what parameter regimes the optimum signal-to-noise ratio is found under experimentally realistic conditions. We compare this technique to the standard method of fluorescence imaging and find that it outperforms fluorescence imaging for compact interferometers using condensed atomic sources or where the photon collection efficiency is limited. However, we find that fluorescence imaging is likely to be the preferred method when using squeezed atomic sources due to limited atom number.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in 2d HCFTs on the curved background: the case of q-M\"obius Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature 617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic and nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron transition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.05\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from tenths to approximately $6\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental studies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent verification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.</description>

Abstract: We present an overview of the mathematical structure of geminal theory within the seniority formalism and bi-variational principle. Named after the constellation, geminal wavefunctions provide the mean-field like representation of paired-electron wavefunctions in quantum chemistry, tying in with the Lewis picture of chemical bonding via electron pairs. Unfortunately, despite its mean-field product wave function description, the computational cost of computing geminal wavefunctions is dominated by the permanent overlaps with Slater determinant reference states. We review recent approaches to reduce the factorial scaling of the permanent, and present the bi-variational principle as a consistent framework for the projected Schr\"odinger Equation and the computation of reduced density matrices.</description>

Abstract: The efficient readout of the relevant information is pivotal for quantum simulation experiments. Often only single observables are accessed by performing standard projective measurements. In this work, we implement a generalized measurement scheme based on controlled outcoupling of atoms. This gives us simultaneous access to number imbalance and relative phase in a system of two tunnel-coupled 1D Bose gases, which realize a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. We demonstrate that our measurement is quantum limited by accessing number squeezing and show that we can track Josephson oscillation dynamics with the generalized measurements. Finally, we show that the scheme allows the extraction of atoms while maintaining the system's coherent dynamics, which opens up the door to accessing multi-time correlation functions. Our scheme constitutes a step towards accessing quantum properties of the sine-Gordon field theory and, in the future, studying spatially extended systems under continuous monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

Abstract: Known as no fast-forwarding theorem in quantum computing, the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be $O(\|H\| t)$ in the worst case, which essentially states that one can not go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant $h \ll 1$), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is $O(h^{-1})$. We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be $O(1)$, that is, to simulate some observables of the Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds [Lasser-Lubich 2020] to uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, of the underlying dynamics and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Information compression via hidden subgroup quantum autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a quantum method for classical information compression that exploits the hidden subgroup quantum algorithm. We consider sequence data in a database with a priori unknown symmetries of the hidden subgroup type. We prove that data with a given group structure can be compressed with the same query complexity as the hidden subgroup problem, which is exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithms. We moreover design a quantum algorithm that variationally finds the group structure and uses it to compress the data. There is an encoder and a decoder, along the paradigm of quantum autoencoders. After the training, the encoder outputs a compressed data string and a description of the hidden subgroup symmetry, from which the input data can be recovered by the decoder. In illustrative examples, our algorithm outperforms the classical autoencoder on the mean squared value of test data. This classical-quantum separation in information compression capability has thermodynamical significance: the free energy assigned by a quantum agent to a system can be much higher than that of a classical agent. Taken together, our results show that a possible application of quantum computers is to efficiently compress certain types of data that cannot be efficiently compressed by current methods using classical computers.</description>

      <title>Refining the weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver: compression of ans\"atze into a single pure state and optimization of weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) is a prominent algorithm for calculating excited-state properties of molecular quantum systems. In this work, we elaborate on some of its fundamental features with the aim of improving its practical realization. First, we demonstrate that the initial ans\"atze for various excited states could be prepared into a single pure state through a minimal number of ancilla qubits, followed by the optimization of a subsequent global unitary rotation in the targeted subspace. Since the ancillas' sole purpose is to purify an underlying ensemble $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ state with spectral weights $\boldsymbol{w}$, their measurement would just collapse $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ with probabilities $w_j$ to one of its eigenstates $|\Psi_j \rangle$. We thus observe that our realization of SSVQE is equivalent to the original SSVQE improved by importance sampling. Then, we elaborate by numerical means on the potential influence of the auxiliary weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ on the accuracy of the sought-after eigenstates and eigenenergies. Clear trends are discovered which are contrasted with some recent mathematical results concerning the ensemble variational principle that underlies SSVQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page-Wootters formalism is a proposal for reconciling the background-dependent, quantum-mechanical notion of time with the background-independence of general relativity. However, the physical meaning of this framework remains debated. In this work, we compare two consistent approaches to the Page-Wootters formalism to clarify the operational meaning of evolution and measurements with respect to a quantum temporal reference frame. The so-called "twirled observable" approach implements measurements as operators that are invariant with respect to the Hamiltonian constraint. The "purified measurement" approach instead models measurements dynamically by modifying the constraint itself. While both approaches agree in the limit of ideal clocks, a natural generalization of the purified measurement approach to the case of non-ideal, finite-resource clocks yields a radically different picture. We discuss the physical origin of this discrepancy and argue that the approaches describe operationally distinct situations. Moreover, we show that, for non-ideal clocks, the purified measurement approach yields time non-local, non-unitary evolution and implies a fundamental limitation to the operational definition of the temporal order of events. Nevertheless, unitarity and definite temporal order can be restored if we assume that time is discrete.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. So far, only the simplest form of DTCs that exhibit period-doubling dynamics has been unambiguously realized in experiments. We develop an intuitive interacting spin-$1/2$ system that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs) and demonstrate its digital simulation on a noisy quantum processor. Remarkably, we found a strong signature of the predicted $4T$-DTC that is robust against and, in some cases, amplified by different types of disorders. Our findings thus shed light on the interplay between disorder and quantum interactions on the formation of time crystallinity beyond periodic-doubling, as well as demonstrate the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forth the concept of quantum noise sensing in nonlinear two-mode interferometers coupled to mechanical oscillators. These autonomous machines are capable of sensing quantum nonlinear correlations of two-mode noisy fields via their thermodynamic variable of extractable work, alias work capacity or ergotropy. The fields are formed by thermal noise input via its interaction with multi-level systems inside the interferometer. Such interactions amount to the generation of two-mode quantum nonlinear gauge fields that may be partly unknown. We show that by monitoring a mechanical oscillator coupled to the interferometer, one can sense the work capacity of one of the output field modes and thereby reveal the quantum nonlinear correlations of the field. The proposed quantum sensing method can provide an alternative to quantum multiport interferometry where the output field is unraveled by tomography. This method may advance the simulation and control of multimode quantum nonlinear gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Handbook for Efficiently Quantifying Robustness of Magic</title>

Abstract: The nonstabilizerness, or magic, is an essential quantum resource to perform universal quantum computation. Robustness of magic (RoM) in particular characterizes the degree of usefulness of a given quantum state for non-Clifford operation. While the mathematical formalism of RoM can be given in a concise manner, it is extremely challenging to determine the RoM in practice, since it involves superexponentially many pure stabilizer states. In this work, we present efficient novel algorithms to compute the RoM. The crucial technique is a subroutine that achieves the remarkable features in calculation of overlaps between pure stabilizer states: (i) the time complexity per each stabilizer is reduced exponentially, (ii) the space complexity is reduced superexponentially. Based on this subroutine, we present algorithms to compute the RoM for arbitrary states up to $n=7$ qubits on a laptop, while brute-force methods require a memory size of 86 TiB. As a byproduct, the proposed subroutine allows us to simulate the stabilizer fidelity up to $n=8$ qubits, for which naive methods require memory size of 86 PiB so that any state-of-the-art classical computer cannot execute the computation. We further propose novel algorithms that utilize the preknowledge on the structure of target quantum state such as the permutation symmetry of disentanglement, and numerically demonstrate our state-of-the-art results for copies of magic states and partially disentangled quantum states. The series of algorithms constitute a comprehensive ``handbook'' to scale up the computation of the RoM, and we envision that the proposed technique applies to the computation of other quantum resource measures as well.</description>

      <title>Efficient Local Classical Shadow Tomography with Number Conservation</title>

Abstract: Shadow tomography aims to build a classical description of a quantum state from a sequence of simple random measurements. Physical observables are then reconstructed from the resulting classical shadow. Shadow protocols which use single-body random measurements are simple to implement and capture few-body observables efficiently, but do not apply to systems with fundamental number conservation laws, such as ultracold atoms. We address this shortcoming by proposing and analyzing a new local shadow protocol adapted to such systems. The "All-Pairs" protocol requires one layer of two-body gates and only $\textrm{poly}(V)$ samples to reconstruct arbitrary few body observables. Moreover, by exploiting the permutation symmetry of the protocol, we derive a linear time post-processing algorithm. We provide a proof-of-principle reference implementation and demonstrate the reconstruction of 2- and 4-point functions in a paired Luttinger liquid of hardcore bosons.</description>

      <title>Taming Quantum Time Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respect to composition. First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed without incurring log factors through error reduction (exactness). Second, through careful accounting (thriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs -- a property that is much less obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these properties were previously seen through the model of span programs (alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors (Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to span programs, by defining quantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently, recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of quantum time complexity.
  In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed. We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query complexity, $Q(f\circ g)=O(Q(f)\cdot Q(g))$, without log factors.
  We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum algorithms based on what we call transducers, and which we think is of large independent interest. While a span program is a completely different computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis.</description>

Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz with Grover Mixer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important property of QAOA with Grover mixer is that its expectation value is invariant over any permutation of states. As a consequence, the algorithm is independent of the structure of the problem. If, on the one hand, this characteristic raises serious doubts about the capacity of the algorithm to overcome the bound of the unstructured search problem, on the other hand, it can pave the way to its analytical study. In this sense, a prior work introduced a statistical approach to analyze GM-QAOA that results in an analytical expression for the expectation value depending on the probability distribution associated with the problem Hamiltonian spectrum. Although the method provides surprising simplifications in calculations, the expression depends exponentially on the number of layers, which makes direct analytical treatment unfeasible. In this work, we extend the analysis to the more simple context of Grover Mixer Threshold QAOA (GM-Th-QAOA), a variant that replaces the phase separation operator of GM-QAOA to encode a threshold function. As a result, we obtain an expression for the expectation value independent of the number of layers and, with it, we provide bounds for different performance metrics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to a more general context of QAOA with Grover mixer, which we called Grover-based QAOA. In that framework, which allows the phase separation operator to encode any compilation of the cost function, we generalize all the bounds by using an argument by contradiction with the optimality of Grover's algorithm on the unstructured search problem. As a result, we get the main contribution of this work, an asymptotic lower bound on the quantile achieved by the expectation value that formalizes the notion that the Grover mixer, at most, reflects a quadratic Grover-style speed-up over classical brute force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect was originally referred to as the faster icing of a higher-temperature system than a lower-temperature system, and was later generalized to anomalous decays of both classical and quantum observables to equilibrium states. Mpemba effect is mostly considered in classical systems and during cooling processes towards equilibrium states. We investigate the emergence of the effect in nonequilibrium quantum systems where the system has no asymptotic equilibrium state to approach. Instead, the system is put in contact with two different baths, and only a nonequilibrium state exists, sustained by constant energy injection from the surrounding thermal baths. Firstly, we show that the nonequilibrium conditions can dramatically enlarge the parameter regimes where the MPE emerges. Secondly, we demonstrate that the anomalous MPEs and inverse MPEs emerge in the evolution of quantum correlations in the two-site fermionic system and that nonequilibrium conditions can expedite or delay the MPEs. Thirdly, we show that the nonequilibrium-induced quantum coherence can have considerable contributions to the emergence of the MPE which the conventional Lindbladian dynamics fails to capture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC) protocol with a high error suppression rate and low overhead is very desirable for the near-term implementation of quantum computers. In this work, we develop a distance-preserving flag FTEC protocol for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which requires only two ancilla qubits per generator and can be implemented on a planar layout. We generalize the weight-parity error correction (WPEC) technique from [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)] and find a gate ordering of flag circuits for the concatenated Steane code which makes syndrome extraction with two ancilla qubits per generator possible. The FTEC protocol is constructed using the optimization tools for flag FTEC developed in [PRX Quantum 5, 020336 (2024)] and is simulated under the circuit-level noise model without idling noise. Our simulations give a pseudothreshold of $1.64 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which is better than a pseudothreshold of $1.43 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[61,1,9]] 6.6.6 color code simulated under the same settings. This is in contrast to the code capacity model where the [[61,1,9]] code performs better.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalization of the two-body contact interaction for non-relativistic particles trapped in one dimension. The particles interact only when they are a distance c apart. The competition of the interaction length scale with the oscillator length leads to three regimes identified from the energy spectra. When c is less than the oscillator length, particles avoid each other, whereas in the opposite case bunching occurs. In the intermediate region where the oscillator length is comparable to c, both exclusion and bunching are manifested. All of these regions are separated by dark states, i.e. bosonic or fermionic states which are not affected by the interactions.</description>

Abstract: Many supervised learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, such as translational and rotational symmetry in image classifications. These symmetries can be exploited to enhance performance. We formulate the symmetry constraints into a concise mathematical form. We design two ways to adopt the constraints into the cost function, thereby shaping the cost landscape in favour of parameter choices which respect the given symmetry. Unlike methods that alter the neural network circuit ansatz to impose symmetry, our method only changes the classical post-processing of gradient descent, which is simpler to implement. We call the method symmetry-guided gradient descent (SGGD). We illustrate SGGD in entanglement classification of Werner states and in a binary classification task in a 2-D feature space. In both cases, the results show that SGGD can accelerate the training, improve the generalization ability, and remove vanishing gradients, especially when the training data is biased.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper titled "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondance between local unitary equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of $2$-qubits. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and through this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to $3$-qubits. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion (first proved in "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" by V. Futorney, R. A. Horn, and V. V. Sergeichuk) to reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of $3$-qubits to checking trace identities and a few other easy-to-check properties. We also note that all of these results can be extended to $2$ and $3$ qudits if we relax the notion of LU equivalence to quasi-LU equivalence, as defined in the aforementioned paper by Jing et. al.</description>

Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performances of QBs. First, we demonstrate that in the long-time limit, only bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe that near-perfect energy transfer can occur in the topologically nontrivial phase. Moreover, the maximum stored energy exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries, where the number of bound states undergoes a transition. Second, when a quantum battery and a quantum charger are coupled at the same sublattice within a unit cell, the ergotropy becomes immune to dissipation at that location, facilitated by a dark state and a topologically robust dressed bound state. Third, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs experiences a temporary boost. Our findings offer valuable guidance for improving quantum battery performance through structured reservoir engineering.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation Algorithms in the Path Integral Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new paradigm for quantum simulation that is based on path integration that allows quantum speedups to be observed for problems that are more naturally expressed using the path integral formalism rather than the conventional sparse Hamiltonian formalism.
  We provide two novel quantum algorithms based on Hamiltonian versions of the path integral formulation and another for Lagrangians of the form $\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2 - V(x)$. This Lagrangian path integral algorithm is based on a new rigorous derivation of a discrete version of the Lagrangian path integral. Our first Hamiltonian path integral method breaks up the paths into short timesteps. It is efficient under appropriate sparsity assumptions and requires a number of queries to oracles that give the eigenvalues and overlaps between the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian terms that scales as $t^{o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)}$ for simulation time $t$ and error $\epsilon$. The second approach uses long-time path integrals for near-adiabatic systems and has query complexity that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ if the energy eigenvalue gaps and simulation time is sufficiently long. Finally, we show that our Lagrangian simulation algorithm requires a number of queries to an oracle that computes the discrete Lagrangian that scales for a system with $\eta$ particles in $D+1$ dimensions, in the continuum limit, as $\widetilde{O}(\eta D t^2/\epsilon)$ if $V(x)$ is bounded and finite and the wave function obeys appropriate position and momentum cutoffs. This shows that Lagrangian dynamics can be efficiently simulated on quantum computers and opens up the possibility for quantum field theories for which the Hamiltonian is unknown to be efficiently simulated on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Cantor potential of minimum lacunarity: Special case of super periodic generalized unified Cantor potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we introduce the concept of generalized unified Cantor potential (GUCP) with the key parameter $N$ which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. This system is characterized by total span $L$, stages $S$, scaling parameter $\rho$ and two real numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) system with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we formulated a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol and investigated the features of non-relativistic quantum tunneling through this potential configuration. We show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave vector $k$ through analytical derivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to create and harness entanglement is crucial to the fields of quantum sensing and simulation, and ultracold atom-cavity systems offer pristine platforms for this undertaking. Here, we present a method for creating and controlling entanglement between solely the motional states of atoms in a cavity without the need for electronic interactions. We show this interaction arises from a general atom-cavity model, and discuss the role of the cavity frequency shift in response to atomic motion. This cavity response leads to many different squeezing interactions between the atomic momentum states. Furthermore, we show that when the atoms form a density grating, the collective motion leads to one-axis twisting, a many-body energy gap, and metrologically useful entanglement even in the presence of noise. Noteably, an experiment has recently demonstrated this regime leads to an effective momentum-exchange interaction between atoms in a common cavity mode. This system offers a highly tunable, many-body quantum sensor and simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric beamsplitter coupling between them. This `joint-photon number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in two superconducting cavities. By leveraging the beamsplitter coupling already required for single-qubit gates, this scheme permits minimal connectivity between circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with a missed erasure fraction of $(9.0 \pm 0.5)\times10^{-4}$, while incurring an erasure rate of $2.92 \pm 0.01\%$ and a Pauli error rate of $0.31 \pm 0.01\%$, both of which are dominated by cavity errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip emitters that generate single and entangled photons are essential for photonic quantum information processing technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm with a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 %. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in circuit quantum electrodynamics have enabled precise manipulation and detection of the single energy quantum in quantum systems. A quantum circuit refrigerator (QCR) is capable of electrically cooling the excited population of quantum systems, such as superconducting resonators and qubits, through photon-assisted tunneling of quasi-particles within a superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. In this study, we demonstrated instantaneous QCR in the quantum regime. We performed the time-resolved measurement of the QCR-induced cooling of photon number inside the superconducting resonator by harnessing a qubit as a photon detector. From the enhanced photon loss rate of the resonator estimated from the amount of the AC Stark shift, the QCR was shown to have a cooling power of approximately 300 aW. Furthermore, even below the single energy quantum, the QCR can reduce the number of photons inside the resonator with 100 ns pulse from thermal equilibrium. Numerical calculations based on the Lindblad master equation successfully reproduced these experimental results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems intractable for classical computers, particularly in popular fields such as cryptography, optimization, and neurocomputing. In this paper, we present a new quantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG) method for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.</description>

Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: While researchers in both industry and academia are racing to build Quantum Computing (QC) platforms with viable performance and functionality, the environmental impacts of this endeavor, such as its carbon footprint, e-waste generation, mineral use, and water and energy consumption, remain largely unknown. A similar oversight occurred during the semiconductor revolution and continues to have disastrous consequences for the health of our planet. As we build the quantum computing stack from the ground up, it is crucial to comprehensively assess it through an environmental sustainability lens for its entire life-cycle: production, use, and disposal. In this paper, we highlight the need and challenges in establishing a QC sustainability benchmark that enables researchers to make informed architectural design decisions and celebrate the potential quantum environmental advantage. We propose a carbon-aware quantum computing (CQC) framework that provides the foundational methodology and open research questions for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a QC platform. Our call to action to the research community is the establishment of a new research direction known as, sustainable quantum computing that promotes both quantum computing for sustainability-oriented applications and the sustainability of quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We study the magneto-photoluminescence of an optically trapped exciton-polariton condensate in a planar semiconductor microcavity with multiple In0.08Ga0.92As quantum wells. Extremely high condensate coherence time and continuous control over the polariton confinement are among the advantages provided by optical trapping. This allows us to resolve magnetically induced {\mu}eV fine-energy shifts in the condensate and identify unusual dynamical regions in its parameter space. We observe polariton Zeeman splitting and, in small traps with tight confinement, demonstrate its full parametric screening when the condensate density exceeds a critical value, reminiscent of the spin-Meissner effect. For larger optical traps, we observe a complete inversion in the Zeeman splitting as a function of power, underlining the importance of condensate confinement and interactions with its background reservoir excitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum limit of sensitivity in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), which has emerged as a favored technique for imaging the structure of a wide variety of materials, including biological and other radiation-sensitive materials. 4D-STEM is an indirect (computational) imaging technique, which uses a scanning beam, and records the scattering distribution in momentum (diffraction) space for each beam position. We find that, in measuring a sample's electrostatic potential, the quantum Fisher information from 4D-STEM can match that from real-space phase-contrast imaging. Near-optimum quantum Fisher information is achieved using a delocalized speckled probe. However, owing to the detection in the diffraction plane, 4D-STEM ultimately enables only about half of the quantum limit, whereas Zernike phase-contrast imaging enables the quantum limit for all spatial frequencies admitted by the optical system. On the other hand, 4D-STEM can yield information on spatial frequencies well beyond those accessible by phase-contrast TEM. Our conclusions extend to analogous imaging modalities using coherent scalar visible light and x-rays.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states, which are superpositions of macroscopically distinct states, are potentially critical resources for upcoming quantum information technologies. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to generate entangled Schr\"odinger cat states in a non-relativistic electric dipole system situated on a two-dimensional plane, along with an external potential and a uniform strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that this setup can lead to the phenomenon of collapse and revival of entanglement for a specific range of our model parameters</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, $2\pi$ quantum phase slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by $4\pi$ quantum phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The results indicate that the $4\pi$-dominated regime can be observed directly in the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We also show that, if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the plasma frequency of the junction, the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of protected qubits.</description>

      <title>Determining Strain Components in a Diamond Waveguide from Zero-Field ODMR Spectra of NV$^{-}$ Center Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{-}$) center in diamond has shown great potential in nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing due to its rich spin physics. An efficient coupling with light, providing strong luminescence, is crucial for realizing these applications. Laser-written waveguides in diamond promote NV$^{-}$ creation and improve their coupling to light but, at the same time, induce strain in the crystal. The induced strain contributes to light guiding but also affects the energy levels of NV$^{-}$ centers. We probe NV$^{-}$ spin states experimentally with the commonly used continuous-wave zero-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). In our waveguides, the ODMR spectra are shifted, split, and consistently asymmetric, which we attribute to the impact of local strain. To understand these features, we model ensemble ODMR signals in the presence of strain. By fitting the model results to the experimentally collected ODMR data, we determine the strain tensor components at different positions, thus determining the strain profile across the waveguide. This shows that zero-field ODMR spectroscopy can be used as a strain imaging tool. The resulting strain within the waveguide is dominated by a compressive axial component transverse to the waveguide structure, with a smaller contribution from vertical and shear strain components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laplacian learning method is a well-established technique in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, but its potential in the quantum domain remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the performance of the Laplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across four benchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing that adding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. The effectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and how well it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varying entangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance of Laplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, with optimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderate levels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity and generalization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need for precise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimal performance in Laplacian learning methods.</description>
