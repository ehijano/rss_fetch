      <title>Long-Term Earth Magnetosphere Science Orbit via Earth-Moon Resonance Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates long-term orbits within the Earth's magnetosphere, specifically focusing on orbits where the argument of periapsis is synchronized with changes induced by lunar gravity assists and the Earth's argument of latitude over a complete orbital period in Earth-Moon resonance. In the Earth-Moon rotating frame, resonance orbits appear repetitive; however, the argument of periapsis shifts due to the third-body effects from lunar flybys. The extent of this shift is influenced by the Jacobi integral associated with the resonance orbit. To identify feasible resonance orbits and the optimal Jacobi integral, we map the argument of periapsis change against the Jacobi integral for each prospective orbit. This synchronization allows the spacecraft to remain within a confined region in space when observed from the Sun-Earth rotating frame. Finally, the article discusses the applications of these long-term Earth magnetosphere science orbits, including orbit-orientation reconfiguration (station keeping) and stability.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneity of Forbush decreases: the simultaneous effects of interplanetary parameters and geomagnetic activity indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forbush decreases (Fd) are transient, short-term reductions in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth's surface. When this reduction is observed at multiple locations at the same time, it is referred to as simultaneous Forbush decreases (SFd). Identifying Fd events in daily averaged Cosmic ray (CR) raw data is always tedious, but the task has gone minimal through an algorithm (automated Fd detection). We deployed an automated Fd location algorithm on daily-averaged CR data from five neutron monitor stations covering the period 1998 to 2006. We identified 80 days with the most simultaneous events. While there exists extensive research on the subject using a case study approach, the current study is statistical. Whereas most of the previous investigations employed a small sample of Fds manually selected from a single CR station, large samples of Fds, selected after disentangling the Sun's influence on CR data from multiple neutron monitors (MNs) are used. The connection between the Fds and many solar-terrestrial variables is tested. The beautiful and consistent results obtained between the space weather variables and Fds at the five NM stations call the attention of space weather researchers to the need for rigorous, detailed, and accurate cataloging of Fds. Solar cycle oscillation significantly impacts the amplitude and timing of Fds. Its influence should be removed before Fd selection.</description>

      <title>Study of Evolution and Geo-effectiveness of CME-CME Interactions using MHD Simulations with SWASTi framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geo-effectiveness of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is a critical area of study in space weather, particularly in the lesser-explored domain of CME-CME interactions and their geomagnetic consequences. This study leverages the SWASTi framework to perform 3D MHD simulation of a range of CME-CME interaction scenarios within realistic solar wind conditions. The focus is on the dynamics of the initial magnetic flux, speed, density, and tilt of CMEs, and their individual and combined impacts on the disturbance storm time (Dst) index. Additionally, the kinematic, magnetic, and structural impacts on the leading CME, as well as the mixing of both CMEs, are analyzed. Time series in-situ studies are conducted through virtual spacecraft positioned along three different longitudes at 1 AU. Our findings reveal that CME-CME interactions are non-uniform along different longitudes due to the inhomogeneous ambient solar wind conditions. A significant increase in the momentum and kinetic energy of the leading CME is observed due to collisions with the trailing CME, along with the formation of reverse shocks in cases of strong interaction. These reverse shocks lead to complex wave patterns inside CME2, which can prolong the storm recovery phase. Furthermore, we observed that the minimum Dst value decreases with an increase in the initial density, tilt, and speed of the trailing CME.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging in Meteorite Craters on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorite craters on the asteroid surface obstruct the horizontal flow of solar wind, forming a plasma wake that modulates the particle fluxes and the electrostatic environment far downstream. In this study, surface charging properties of asteroids with nontrivial terrain are simulated based on neural network and the finite element method. Key factors such as the location, size and depth-to-width ratio of craters are all considered. Under normal conditions, as the latitude of the crater increases, the potential variation at its floor during a rotation gradually becomes smoother, finally stabilizing around -3V with minor fluctuations as the crater approaches the poles. For craters with a depth-to-width ratio greater than 0.5, because of the diverging motions of electrons and the less deflected trajectories of ions, completely different charging results are observed under parallel and perpendicular solar wind incidence, the potential around the crater floor decreases and increases with the rising depth-to-width ratio, respectively. While the surface potential appears indifferent to changes in crater size, only during solar storms, the floor of large-scale craters, such as those with a diameter of 800m, perform a 9.13V decrease in potential compared to small craters of 50m. Both studies of localized plasma flow field and the surface charging phenomenon of asteroids have substantial influence on the future safe landing and exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Development of a Machine Learning based Radio source localisation algorithm for Tri-axial antenna configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the origin of radio emissions is essential for numerous scientific experiments, particularly in radio astronomy. Conventional techniques, such as the use of antenna arrays encounter significant challenges, specially at very low frequencies, due to factors like the substantial size of the antennas and ionospheric interference. To address these challenges, we employ a space-based single-telescope that utilizes co-located antennas, complemented by goniopolarimetric techniques for precise source localization. This study explores a novel and elementary machine learning (ML) technique as a way to improve and estimate Direction of Arrival (DoA), leveraging a tri-axial antenna arrangement for radio source localization. Employing a simplistic emission and receiving antenna model, our study involves training an artificial neural network (ANN) using synthetic radio signals. These synthetic signals can originate from any location in the sky and cover an incoherent frequency range of 0.3 to 30 MHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 0 and 60 dB. Then, a large data set was generated to train the ANN model catering to the possible signal configurations and variations. After training, the developed ANN model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving loss levels in the training ($\sim0.02$), validation ($\sim0.23\%$), and testing ($\sim0.21\%$) phases. The machine learning-based approach remarkably, exhibits substantially quicker inference times ($\sim5$ ms) in contrast to analytically derived Direction of Arrival (DoA) methods, which typically range from 100 ms to a few seconds. This underscores its practicality for real-time applications in radio source localization, particularly in scenarios with limited number of sensors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic connectivity from the Sun to the Earth with MHD models I. Impact of the magnetic modelling for connectivity validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses the magnetic connectivity between the Sun and the Earth, which is essential for understanding solar wind and space weather events. Due to limited direct observations, reliable simulations are necessary. The most commonly used method is the two-step ballistic method, but it has many free parameters that affect the results. The authors propose a method based on self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. They combine the COCONUT coronal model with the EUHFORIA heliospheric model to compute magnetic field lines from the Earth to the Sun and quantify spatial and temporal uncertainties. To validate their method, they analyze four events associated with high-speed streams from well-identified coronal holes. The results show partial overlap with the assumed coronal holes of origin, ranging from 19% to 100% depending on the event. They also examine the magnetic polarity observed on Earth, finding that MHD simulations provide a good polarity estimation, with agreement ranging from 36% to 69% across the events. Spatial and temporal uncertainties explain the mixed results for some cases. MHD models appear more effective during periods of maximum solar activity due to the latitudinal extent of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The authors conclude that MHD models offer results as good as the two-step ballistic method, with potential for improvement as more critical physics are integrated into the models.</description>

      <title>Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic interactions which transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy -- excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfv\'en wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfv\'enic quasimodes that do not satisfy the Alfv\'en wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts: nonresonant Alfv\'enic quasimodes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfv\'enic quasimodes and $\omega=k_\parallel{V_A}=0$ modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on albedo neutrons in lunar surface: A computational investigation by means of GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the interaction of the cosmic ray protons with the lunar surface in the absence and presence of hydrogen, a series of GEANT4 simulations are employed in the current study to unveil the influence of hydrogen on the energy spectrum of the albedo neutrons that escape from the lunar surface. Initially, a discrete 69-bin proton energy spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV based on the PAMELA spectrometer is implemented into GEANT4. Subsequently, a single-volume lunar surface of 2-m thickness is constructed where it is assumed that a single layer of either 1.6 or 1.93 g/cm$^{3}$ constitutes the lunar regolith. The material composition in the present study includes 43.7 wt.$\%$ oxygen, 0.3 wt.$\%$ sodium, 5.6 wt.$\%$ magnesium, 9 wt.$\%$ aluminum, 21.1 wt.$\%$ silicon, 8.5 wt.$\%$ calcium, 1.5 wt.$\%$ titanium, 0.1 wt.$\%$ manganese, and 10.2 wt.$\%$ iron in accordance with another study. Then, 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is introduced by replacing oxygen in order to assess the impact of hydrogen on the secondary neutrons. In the wake of irradiating a lunar surface of 3$\times$2$\times$3 m$^{3}$ with a planar vertical PAMELA proton beam of 20$\times$20 cm$^{2}$, the depth profile of the generated neutrons as well as the corresponding initial energy spectrum is primarily obtained in the absence and presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen by voxelizing the entire geometry with 100 cells of 2-cm thickness. Next, a surface detector is placed at the top of the lunar surface in order to collect the albedo neutrons in both cases, and the energy spectra of the albedo neutrons are acquired in terms of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutrons. From the GEANT4 simulations in this study, it is shown that the presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is observable in each energy regime of the albedo neutrons at the lunar surface, thereby providing an indication about the elemental variation of the lunar soil.</description>
