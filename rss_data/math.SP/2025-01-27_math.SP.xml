      <title>Manifolds with many small wormholes: norm resolvent and spectral convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results concerning the norm convergence of resolvents for wildperturbations of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This article is a continuation of ouranalysis on wildly perturbed manifolds presented in [AP21]. We study here manifoldswith an increasing number of small (i.e., short and thin) handles added. The handlescan also be seen as wormholes, as they connect different parts being originally far away.We consider two situations: if the small handles are distributed too sparse the limitoperator is the unperturbed one on the initial manifold, the handles are fading. Onthe other hand, if the small handles are dense in certain regions the limit operator isthe Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on functions which are identical on the two partsjoined by the handles, the handles hence produce adhesion. Our results also apply tonon-compact manifolds. Our work is based on a norm convergence result for operatorsacting in varying Hilbert spaces described in the book [P12] by the second author.</description>

      <title>The superadiabatic projectors method applied to the spectral theory of magnetic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with a generalization of the superadiabatic projectors method. In a general framework, the well-known superadiabatic projectors are constructed and accurately described in the case of rank one, when a remarkable factorization occurs. We apply these ideas to spectral theory and we explain how our abstract results allow to recover or improve recent results about the semiclassical magnetic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Left invertible quasi-isometric liftings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-isometric liftings similar to isometries, for the operators similar to contractions in Hilbert spaces, are investigated. The existence of such liftings is established, and their applications are explored for specific operator classes, including quasicontractions. A particular focus is placed on operators that admit left invertible minimal quasi-isometric liftings. These operators are characterized within the framework of $A$-contractions, and the matrix structures of their liftings are analyzed, highlighting parallels with the isometric liftings of contractions.</description>

      <title>Pleijel's theorem for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned in this paper with the real eigenfunctions of Schr\"odinger operators. We prove an asymptotic upper bound for the number of their nodal domains, which implies in particular that the inequality stated in Courant's theorem is strict, except for finitely many eigenvalues. Results of this type originated in 1956 with Pleijel's Theorem on the Dirichlet Laplacian and were obtained for some classes of Schr\"odinger operators by the first author, alone and in collaboration with B. Helffer and T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof. Using methods in part inspired by work of the second author on Neumann and Robin Laplacians, we greatly extend the scope of these previous results.</description>

      <title>The Widom-Sobolev formula for discontinuous matrix-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Widom-Sobolev formula for the asymptotic behaviour of truncated Wiener-Hopf operators with discontinuous matrix-valued symbols for three different classes of test functions. The symbols may depend on both position and momentum except when closing the asymptotics for twice differentiable test functions with H\"older singularities. The cut-off domains are allowed to have piecewise differentiable boundaries. In contrast to the case where the symbol is smooth in one variable, the resulting coefficient in the enhanced area law we obtain here remains as explicit for matrix-valued symbols as it is for scalar-valued symbols.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the Neumann magnetic Laplacian in the unit disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions in the unit disk $\mathbb D$ in $\mathbb R^2$. There is a rather complete asymptotic analysis when the constant magnetic field tends to $+\infty$ and some inequalities seem to hold for any value of this magnetic field, leading to rather simple conjectures. Our goal is to explore these questions by revisiting a classical picture of the physicist D. Saint-James theoretically and numerically. On the way, we revisit the asymptotic analysis in light of the asymptotics obtained by Fournais-Helffer, that we can improve by combining them with a formula stated by Saint-James.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of infinite dimensional dissipative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singularity of operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike to the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions to dissipative differential-algebraic operator equations is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>
