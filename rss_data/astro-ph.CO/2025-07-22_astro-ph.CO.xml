      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Testing gravitational physics by combining DESI DR1 and weak lensing datasets using the E_G estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of gravitational physics across space-time creates observable signatures in the behaviour of light and matter. We perform combined-probe studies using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), in combination with three existing weak lensing surveys, to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard model of cosmology (LCDM). We focus on measuring the gravitational estimator statistic, E_G, which describes the relative amplitudes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy velocities induced by a common set of overdensities. By comparing our amplitude measurements with their predicted scale- and redshift-dependence within the GR+LCDM model, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the predictions of the Planck cosmology. The redshift span of the DESI dataset allows us to perform these E_G measurements at the highest redshifts achieved to date, z ~ 1.</description>

      <title>Simba Simulation: The Effect of Feedback Physics on Matter Distribution in the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question "What is dark matter?" still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.</description>

      <title>An AI super-resolution field emulator for cosmological hydrodynamics: the Lyman-{\alpha} forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k &lt; 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: environmental drivers of Local Group reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.</description>

      <title>Investigating Interacting Dark Energy Models Using Fast Radio Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as novel observational probes to constrain models of interacting dark energy (IDE). By leveraging FRB dispersion measures (DMs) and redshifts, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three IDE models: gamma_m IDE, gamma_x IDE, and xi IDE, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on 86 localized FRBs and simulated datasets containing 2500 to 10000 mock events. By disentangling the contributions to the observed DMs from the Milky Way, host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM), key cosmological parameters are constrained, including the Hubble constant (H0), matter density (Omega_m), the dark energy equation of state (omega_x), and interaction strengths (gamma_m, gamma_x, xi). The best-fit values of the gamma_m IDE model indicate a potential alleviation of the cosmic coincidence problem. Subsequently, we utilize information criteria (IC) to conduct a comparative assessment of the three IDE models. When applied to the current sample of observed FRBs, the xi IDE model yields slightly lower IC values than the gamma_m IDE and gamma_x IDE models across all three criteria, although the differences are not statistically significant. These results underscore the value of FRB measurements as complementary probes that provide further constraints on alternative cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>Inference of matter power spectrum at z=0 using DESI DR1 Full-Shape data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of galaxy distributions at large cosmic distances capture clustering from the past. In this study, we use a cosmological model to translate these observations into the present-day galaxy distribution. Specifically, we reconstruct the 3D matter power spectrum at redshift $ z = 0 $ using Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 (DR1) galaxy clustering data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, assuming the $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ model, and compare it to the result assuming the $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $ model. Building on previous state-of-the-art methods, we apply Effective Field Theory (EFT) modelling of the galaxy power spectrum to account for small-scale effects in the 2-point statistics of galaxy data. The EFT approach offers a more robust methodology than traditional methods for modelling the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy clustering data, which can be used to test the consistency of the assumed cosmological model. By incorporating both CMB and galaxy clustering data across a range of redshifts, we can identify discrepancies between the datasets, which would indicate potential inaccuracies in the assumed expansion history. While previous studies have shown consistency with $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $, this work extends the analysis with higher-quality data to further test the expansion histories of both $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ and $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $. Our findings show that both $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ and $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $ provide consistent fits to the matter power spectrum recovered from DESI DR1 data.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on null tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model with SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we quantify the ability of the upcoming SPHEREx survey to constrain cosmological observables and test the internal consistency of the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using Fisher matrix forecasting, we assess the expected precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observables, such as the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We further explore SPHEREx's potential to probe some of the fundamental assumptions of large-scale spatial homogeneity and isotropy, through model-independent reconstructions of several consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we also examine the effect of the model dependence of the resulting Fisher and covariance matrices, using a neural network (NN) classification approach. We find that, while it is commonly assumed the covariance matrix depends weakly on the model, in fact the NN can very accurately ($\sim 98\%$) detect the underlying fiducial cosmological model based solely on the covariance matrix of the data, thus challenging this assumption.</description>

      <title>Planck constraints on the scale dependence of isotropic cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation of the linear polarisation plane of photons during propagation, also known as cosmic birefringence, is a powerful probe of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism. Using Planck legacy data, we confirm previous estimates of the isotropic birefringence angle, finding $\beta \simeq 0.30 \pm 0.05$ [deg] at 68% CL, not including the systematic error from the instrumental polarisation angle. If this is a genuine signal, it could be explained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which could lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the hypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To investigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit the birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\beta_{\ell}$, with a power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a non-vanishing constant birefringence angle. The first method shows no significant dependence on the harmonic scale (up to $1.8\sigma$ CL), while the second method demonstrates that a constant model is favored by Bayesian evidence. This conclusion is robust across all four published Planck CMB solutions. Finally, we forecast that upcoming CMB observations by Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD and a wishful CMB-Stage 4 experiment could reduce current uncertainties by a factor of approximately 7.</description>

      <title>Weinberg's theorem, phantom crossing and screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Artifacts in Halo Shapes: Imprints of the Initial Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid type pre-initial conditions are commonly used to initialize particle positions in cosmological simulations. While these conditions are known to produce noticeable numerical artifacts in void regions, their impact on halo properties has generally been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we employ multiple simulations to demonstrate that grid initialization induces statistically significant artifacts in halo shapes, despite the modest absolute amplitude ($\sim 1\%$) making them unimportant for most cosmological studies. We identify a redshift-dependent artificial alignment pattern: at low redshifts ($z&lt;2$), halo shapes preferentially orient away from the simulation box's Cartesian axes, whereas their constituent particles initially exhibit alignment with these axes. We propose a mathematical hypothesis to explain this flipping behavior.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes with anisotropic hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.</description>

      <title>Physical parameter regression from black hole images via a multiscale adaptive neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision regression of physical parameters from black hole images generated by General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) is essential for investigating spacetime curvature and advancing black hole astrophysics. However, due to limitations in observational resolution, high observational costs, and imbalanced distributions of positive and negative samples, black hole images often suffer from data scarcity, sparse parameter spaces, and complex structural characteristics. These factors pose significant challenges to conventional regression methods based on simplified physical models. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Multiscale Adaptive Network (MANet) , a novel regression framework grounded in deep learning. MANet integrates an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module to selectively enhance features in physically informative regions. Meanwhile, a Multiscale Enhancement Feature Pyramid (MEFP) is employed to capture fine-grained spatial structures such as photon rings and accretion disks, while alleviating information loss due to downsampling. Experimental evaluations on GRRT-simulated datasets demonstrate that MANet substantially improves parameter estimation accuracy and generalization capability in high-dimensional parameter spaces, outperforming existing baseline approaches. This framework presents a promising avenue for high-precision parameter regression in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data analysis and broader astrophysical imaging applications characterized by sparse and noisy data.</description>

      <title>Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>

      <title>Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DAMIC-M collaboration recently reported impressive bounds on sub-GeV dark matter, robustly testing both thermal and non-thermal models for the very first time. In this work we derive novel bounds from the recent PandaX-4T ionization S2-only search for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We find that the PandaX-4T S2-only data is able to compete with the DAMIC-M results, providing the best constraints for scalar and asymmetric thermal dark matter models for masses between 20 to 200 MeV. We further discuss the implications of recent direct detection results for several other sub-GeV dark matter models, highlighting their complementarity with astrophysical, cosmological and laboratory probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Reionisation with the Cosmic Star Formation and AGN Luminosity History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$ ($12^{+10}_{-11}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 63\%$ ($79^{+21}_{-44}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission from [OIII] Emitters Near Reionization: The role of environment in galaxy Ly$\alpha$ detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission to probe reionization relies on establishing baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of $z \sim 5$--6 star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal sample for determining how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on galaxy properties and environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use Keck LRIS to measure the Ly$\alpha$ emission of 46 JWST-selected [OIII]-emitting galaxies over $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$ in the foreground of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of galaxies detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission is consistent with previous works; however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an apparent deficit of Ly$\alpha$ in the largest group in our sample, at $z \simeq 6.19$, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from this group may be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a high rate of Ly$\alpha$ emission in two groups at $z \simeq 5.73$ and $z \simeq 5.78$. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ emission. While our sample size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant role in the detectability of galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission even as late as $z \sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.</description>

      <title>Split supersymmetry and hybrid inflation in light of Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent measurement of the scalar spectral index, $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data, we present an update on the split supersymmetry hybrid inflation model, also known as $\mu$-term hybrid inflation. The model employs a canonical K\"{a}hler potential but incorporates an additional renormalizable term in the superpotential $W$, which yields the MSSM $\mu$-term following supersymmetry breaking. This additional term in $W$ is responsible for a high reheat temperature, $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, and consequently the necessity of split supersymmetry in this class of models. The predicted scalar spectral index is in excellent agreement with the ACT measurement and $r$, the tensor to scalar ratio, is estimated to be less than or of order $10^{-2} -10^{-3}$. For the running of the scalar spectral index we find $|dn_s/d \ln k| = O(10^{-4})$. With $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, leptogenesis is readily implemented in this class of models. A wino-like LSP with mass of around 2 TeV is a plausible dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Impact of cavities on the detection of quadratically coupled ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light scalar fields may explain the nature of the dark matter in our universe. If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard Model the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter energy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its cosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the presence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a cavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the scalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar dark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly coupled models. We also discuss the possibility that quadratically coupled ultra-light scalar dark matter could be detected by the differential measurement of the force on two cavities of the same mass but different internal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theories breaking diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), consisting of multiple scalar fields in a cosmological background. In particular, we focus on models involving a field dominated by its kinetic term and a field dominated by its potential, coupled to gravity through power-law functions of the metric determinant. The Diff symmetry breaking results in the individual energy-momentum tensors not being conserved, although the total conservation-law is satisfied. Consequently, an energy exchange takes place between the fields, acting as an effective interaction between them. With this in mind, we consider the covariantized approach to describe the theory in a Diff invariant way but with an additional field, and discuss the phenomenological consequences of these models when it comes to the study of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies including the effect of radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an empirical yet physically motivated simulation of realistic Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\sim2-3$, crucial for ongoing and forthcoming cosmological LAE surveys. We combine an empirical $\mathtt{UniverseMachine}$ galaxy-halo model with a simple spherical expanding shell model for the Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer, calibrating only three free parameters to simultaneously reproduce the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity function and the angular clustering. Our LAE model is further supported by its consistency with other observables such as the Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent width distribution, the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction as a function of stellar mass and dust reddening, and the systemic velocity offsets. Our LAE model provides predictions for the halo occupation distributions for LAEs and relationship between Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and halo mass, including the distribution of satellite LAEs. Our work provides a crucial first step towards creating a high-fidelity LAE synthetic catalog for the LAE cosmology surveys. We make our LAE catalog and spectra publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass-Dispersion Measure Correlations Constrain Baryonic Feedback in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 &lt; M^* / M_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m &gt; 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline. Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback in the Local Universe $(z &lt; 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo mass and redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Impact of Low ell's on Large Scale Structure Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model.
  Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.</description>

      <title>A Novel Bispectrum Estimator of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect using Projected Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of current and future high-resolution CMB experiments, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has become a unique observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocities in the Universe. In this work, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form temperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from cleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any tracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the line-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is restricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the non-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks for squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long temperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}-$density projected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this bispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that the lensing correction to this estimator's signal is relatively small for high-SNR squeezed triangle configurations. We study the dependence of this kSZ signal on $\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial constraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear galaxy bias regime. Our work illustrates the potential of the projected-fields kSZ bispectrum as a novel probe of baryonic abundance and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with upcoming precision measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to non-zero neutrino rest masses we expect the energy density today in non-relativistic matter, $\omega_{\rm m}$, to be greater than the sum of baryon and cold dark matter densities, $\omega_{\rm cb}$. We also expect the amplitude of deflections of CMB photons due to gravitational lensing to be suppressed relative to expectations assuming massless neutrinos. The combination of CMB and BAO data, however, appear to be defying both of these expectations. Here we review how the neutrino rest mass is determined from cosmological observations, and emphasize the complementary roles played by BAO and lensing data in this process. We then use a phenomenological model to find that the preference from CMB and BAO data for a matter density that is below expectations from the CMB alone is at the $2.3\, \sigma$ level. We also show that if a fraction of the dark matter decays to dark radiation, the preference for $\omega_{\rm m} &gt; \omega_{\rm cb}$ can be restored, but with a small increase to the CMB lensing excess.</description>

Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters through two model-independent approaches: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+(BAO+BBN+CMB) gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below $1\%$. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. In addition, the BAO+BBN+CMB dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating a precision of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, BAO+BBN+CMB, and CC data sets provides tighter constraints, for example, $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. In particular, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a confidence level $1\sigma$. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 &lt; 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-1000: cosmological constraints and mass calibration from counts and weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the joint modelling of weak-lensing and count measurements of the galaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000 clusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a redshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have been derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$. Based on self-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the background galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties arising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the cluster $z$ and $\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and miscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated with cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric distortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass function, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy based on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics and photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led to a halving of the uncertainties on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, as we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.22\pm0.02$ and $\sigma_8=0.86\pm0.03$. The constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$, $S_8=0.74\pm0.03$, is in excellent agreement with recent cluster count and KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analyses, while it shows a $2.8\sigma$ tension with Planck cosmic microwave background results. The constraints on the $\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation imply a mass precision of 8%, on average. In addition, the result on the intrinsic scatter of the $\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation, $\sigma_{\rm intr}=0.05\pm0.02$, confirms that $\lambda^*$ is an excellent mass proxy.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We study how this quadrupolar signature manifests in correlations between general GW detector pairs, characterized by their antenna responses. Focusing on space-based missions including laser interferometers (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and atom interferometers (AEDGE/MAGIS), we demonstrate how orbital motion dynamically modulates detector correlations through time-dependent separations and relative orientation shifts. These modulations encode unique statistical features that serve as definitive markers of the SGWB's quadrupolar nature. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Dirac Leptogenesis in Left-Right Symmetric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Left-right symmetric models which employ a generalized seesaw mechanism to generate quark and charged lepton masses are known to solve the strong CP problem via parity symmetry, without the need for the axion. These models lead to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their masses arising through radiatve corrections. In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can be implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar doublets $\phi_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this purpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small neutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these scalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E_i$) involved in the seesaw mechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E_i \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{jR} \,\phi_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\nu_{R}$) asymmetry, while preserving total lepton number. The compensating lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. We show that for a large range of model parameters successful baryogenesis can be realized, with the $W_R^\pm$ gauge boson mass of order $10^{11}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high-density matter blobs that developed due to these fluctuations. We study here such a collapse, which are seeded by a scalar field $\phi$ associated to a non-trivial potential function $V(\phi)$, minimally coupled to gravity. Such a continual collapse is presumed to form a black hole always and is named a primordial black hole (PBH). Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the scalar field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) falls within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.</description>

      <title>The effects of projection on measuring the splashback feature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$ is a boundary of a halo that separates infalling and accreted matter. This results in a steep drop in the density profile at $R_{\rm st}$, which is a commonly adopted proxy for $R_{\rm sp}$. Observationally, $R_{\rm st}$ can be measured through fitting the projected galaxy number density profile of the halo, but there has been some discrepancy between the observed and expected $R_{\rm st}$. Therefore, we investigate whether the projection of the density profile onto the plane of the sky could lead to any systematic bias in determining $R_{\rm st}$, by studying the true 3-dimensional and projected halo density profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We investigate a range of projection lengths, and find that $R^p_{\rm st}$ obtained from projected profiles is close to the true $R^*_{\rm st}$, but has a slight decreasing trend with increasing projection length. We also quantify the prominence of the splashback feature and find how the feature shape changes with projection length.</description>

      <title>Pre-thermalized Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational wave (GW) production mechanism from gravitons generated during the pre-thermal phase of cosmic reheating, where the energy density is dominated by non-thermalized inflaton decay products, dubbed reheatons. We consider multiple production channels, including: $i)$ pure inflaton-inflaton annihilation, $ii)$ graviton Bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $iii)$ scatterings between an inflaton and a reheaton, and $iv)$ scatterings among reheatons. To determine the resulting GW spectrum, we solve the Boltzmann equation to obtain the graviton phase-space distribution for each channel. We find that the third channel, $iii)$, dominates due to the large occupation number of reheatons at highly-energetic states during the pre-thermalization phase. Notably, in scenarios with a low inflaton mass, the GW spectrum could fall within the sensitivity range of future experiments such as the Einstein Telescope, the Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer, and ultimate DECIGO.</description>

      <title>The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5$\sigma$ depths $\sim31.5$ mag at $\geq2$ $\mu$m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>
