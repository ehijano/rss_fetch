      <title>REALISM: A Regulatory Framework for Coordinated Scheduling in Multi-Operator Shared Micromobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared micromobility (e.g., shared bikes and electric scooters), as a kind of emerging urban transportation, has become more and more popular in the world. However, the blooming of shared micromobility vehicles brings some social problems to the city (e.g., overloaded vehicles on roads, and the inequity of vehicle deployment), which deviate from the city regulator's expectation of the service of the shared micromobility system. In addition, the multi-operator shared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their non-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of multi-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of vehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real world. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework for coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that incorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score to each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators' individual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value. To realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of assigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score assignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating procedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other until convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter usage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method achieves a performance gain of at least 39.93% in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82% in the average demand satisfaction of the whole city.</description>

      <title>FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI: Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33 and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with ties".</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Agent Framework for Universal Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities, enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text, image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases: Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector - engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility, scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Agentic Design Review System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.</description>

      <title>Smooth Games of Configuration in the Linear-Quadratic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.</description>

      <title>A New Query Expansion Approach via Agent-Mediated Dialogic Inquiry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by supplementing initial queries with richer information. While recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield homogeneous, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve relevant information. In this paper, we propose AMD: a new Agent-Mediated Dialogic Framework that engages in a dialogic inquiry involving three specialized roles: (1) a Socratic Questioning Agent reformulates the initial query into three sub-questions, with each question inspired by a specific Socratic questioning dimension, including clarification, assumption probing, and implication probing, (2) a Dialogic Answering Agent generates pseudo-answers, enriching the query representation with multiple perspectives aligned to the user's intent, and (3) a Reflective Feedback Agent evaluates and refines these pseudo-answers, ensuring that only the most relevant and informative content is retained. By leveraging a multi-agent process, AMD effectively crafts richer query representations through inquiry and feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including BEIR and TREC demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>UniOcc: A Unified Benchmark for Occupancy Forecasting and Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark and toolkit for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and occupancy prediction (i.e., predicting current-frame occupancy from camera images. UniOcc unifies the data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), providing 2D/3D occupancy labels and annotating innovative per-voxel flows. Unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel evaluation metrics that do not depend on ground-truth labels, enabling robust assessment on additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance. Our data and code are available at https://uniocc.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

      <title>Competitive Algorithms for Multi-Agent Ski-Rental Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.</description>
