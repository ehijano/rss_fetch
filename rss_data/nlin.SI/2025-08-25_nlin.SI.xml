      <title>On the Dbar method and direct linearization approach of the lattice KdV type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between the Dbar method and the direct linearization approach for the lattice Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) type equations. We develop the Dbar method to study some discrete integrable equations in the Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. A Dbar problem is considered to define the eigenfunctions of the Lax pair of the lattice potential KdV equation. We show how an extra parameter is introduced in this approach so that the lattice potential modified KdV equation and lattice Schwarzian KdV equation are derived. We also explain how the so-called spectral Wronskians make sense in constructing the H3$(\delta)$, Q1$(\delta)$ and Q3$(\delta)$ equations. Explicit formulae of multi-soliton solutions are given for the derived equations, from which one can see the connections between the direct linearization variables ($S^{(i,j)}$ and $V(p)$) and the eigenfunctions and their expansions respectively at infinity and a finite point.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to find Exact Solutions of Nonlinear ODE Systems: Applications to Coupled Non-Integrable and Integrable mKdV Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is introduced for deriving exact solutions to nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. This method consists of four parts. In the initial part, the examined nonlinear differential equation system is transformed into a linear differential equation system using an infinite series sum transformation and Adomian polynomials. In the second part, we presented a modified method of variation of parameters utilizing a revised Cramer's rule for addressing a linear system of block matrices. In the following part, we merged the outcomes of the prior two parts and introduced a new recursive method for acquiring a series solution of the system established in the first section. In the final part, we introduce the fundamental ideas of the multiplicative inverse of power series and methods for summing infinite series. The method utilizes the property that the multiplicative inverse of the power series either terminates after a finite number of terms or simplifies to a geometric series, which can be easily summed to yield closed-form solutions for the series in question. The effectiveness of this method is shown by successfully deriving exact localized solutions for both integrable and non-integrable coupled modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. Using the multiplicative inverse technique, it is shown that a rational generating function can be created for the series solution derived from the proposed method for the specified system of nonlinear differential equations, regardless of whether it is integrable or non-integrable.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality in classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of the noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is a large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>
