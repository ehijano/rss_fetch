      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>A modular quantum gas platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a modular platform for programmable quantum simulation with atomic quantum gases. The platform is centered around exchangeable optical modules with versatile functionalities. The performance of each module is disentangled from all others, enabling individual validation and maintenance of its outputs. The relative spatial positioning of the modules with respect to the position of the atomic sample is set by a global reference frame. In this way, the platform simplifies re-configuration and upgrading of existing setups and accelerates the design of new machines in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Furthermore, it facilitates collaboration among different experimental groups. This standardized hardware design framework, which we call Heidelberg Quantum Architecture, paves the way towards a new generation of on-demand and highly adaptable quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Excitonic oscillator-strength saturation dominates polariton-polariton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities exhibit large two-body interactions that, thanks to ever refined nanotechnology techniques, are getting closer and closer to the quantum regime where single-photon nonlinearities start being relevant. To foster additional progress in this direction, in this work we experimentally investigate the microscopic mechanism driving polariton-polariton interactions. We measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations that are thermally generated on top of a coherent fluid of interacting lower-polaritons. By comparing the measurements with the Bogoliubov theory over both the lower and upper polariton branches simultaneously, we find that polariton-polariton interactions stem dominantly from a mechanism of saturation of the exciton oscillator strength.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium surface fluctuations on the Rydberg transition of trapped electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium is an extremely clean system which holds promise for a scalable qubit platform. However, the superfluid surface is not free from fluctuations which might cause the decay and dephasing of the electrons quantized states. Understanding and mitigating these fluctuations is essential for the advancement of electrons-on-helium (eHe) qubit technology. Some work has been recently done to investigate surface oscillations due to the mechanical vibration of the cryostat using a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. In the present work, we focus on a sub-hertz frequency range and observe a strong effect of surface oscillations on the temporal dynamics of the Rydberg transition of electrons confined in a microchannel trapping device. We suggest possible origin of such oscillations and find a reasonable agreement between the corresponding estimation of the oscillation frequency and the observed result.</description>

      <title>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid Behavior in a Rydberg-encoded Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Interaction quenches in Bose gases studied with a time-dependent hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new variational method to study the dynamics of a closed bosonic many-body system, the time-dependent hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method, tHNC . Based on the Jastrow ansatz, it accounts for quantum fluctuations in a non-perturbative way. tHNC scales well with the number of dimensions, as demonstrated by our results on one, two, and three dimensions. We apply the tHNC method to interaction quenches, i.e. sudden changes of the interaction strength, in homogeneous Bose gases. When the quench is strong enough that the final state has roton excitations (as found and predicted for dipolar and Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates, respectively), the pair distribution function exhibits stable oscillations. For validation, we compare tHNC results with time-dependent variational Monte Carlo results in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum dimer models with Rydberg gadgets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Effective Polaron Dynamics of an Impurity Particle Interacting with a Fermi Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a homogeneous ideal Fermi gas coupled to an impurity particle on a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary condition. For large Fermi momentum $k_\text{F}$, we prove that the effective dynamics is generated by a Fr\"ohlich-type polaron Hamiltonian, which linearly couples the impurity particle to an almost-bosonic excitation field. Moreover, we prove that the effective dynamics can be approximated by an explicit coupled coherent state. Our method is applicable to a range of interaction couplings, in particular including interaction couplings of order 1 and time scales of the order $k_\text{F}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>
