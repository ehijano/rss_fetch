      <title>Dynamics of Resource Allocation in O-RANs: An In-depth Exploration of On-Policy and Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful tool used for addressing complex challenges in mobile networks. This paper investigates the application of two DRL models, on-policy and off-policy, in the field of resource allocation for Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). The on-policy model is the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and the off-policy model is the Sample Efficient Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER), which focuses on resolving the challenges of resource allocation associated with a Quality of Service (QoS) application that has strict requirements. Motivated by the original work of Nessrine Hammami and Kim Khoa Nguyen, this study is a replication to validate and prove the findings. Both PPO and ACER are used within the same experimental setup to assess their performance in a scenario of latency-sensitive and latency-tolerant users and compare them. The aim is to verify the efficacy of on-policy and off-policy DRL models in the context of O-RAN resource allocation. Results from this replication contribute to the ongoing scientific research and offer insights into the reproducibility and generalizability of the original research. This analysis reaffirms that both on-policy and off-policy DRL models have better performance than greedy algorithms in O-RAN settings. In addition, it confirms the original observations that the on-policy model (PPO) gives a favorable balance between energy consumption and user latency, while the off-policy model (ACER) shows a faster convergence. These findings give good insights to optimize resource allocation strategies in O-RANs. Index Terms: 5G, O-RAN, resource allocation, ML, DRL, PPO, ACER.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.</description>

      <title>Exploring Evolutionary Spectral Clustering for Temporal-Smoothed Clustered Cell-Free Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustered cell-free networking, which dynamically partitions the whole network into nonoverlapping subnetworks, has been recently proposed to mitigate the cell-edge problem in cellular networks. However, prior works only focused on optimizing clustered cell-free networking in static scenarios with fixed users. This could lead to a large number of handovers in the practical dynamic environment with moving users, seriously hindering the implementation of clustered cell-free networking in practice. This paper considers user mobility and aims to simultaneously maximize the sum rate and minimize the number of handovers. By transforming the multi-objective optimization problem into a time-varying graph partitioning problem and exploring evolutionary spectral clustering, a temporal-smoothed clustered cell-free networking algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be effective in smoothing network partitions over time and reducing handovers while maintaining similar sum rate.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-Based Near-Optimal MIMO Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is essential for the optimal functioning of next-generation wireless networks; however, enhancing its signal-detection performance for improved spectral efficiency is challenging. Here, we propose an approach that transforms the discrete MIMO detection problem into a continuous problem while leveraging the efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. For this continuous framework, we employ a mixture of t-distributions as the prior distribution. To improve the performance in the coded case further, we treat the likelihood's temperature parameter as a random variable and address its optimization. This treatment leads to the adoption of a horseshoe density for the likelihood. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal detection performance while maintaining polynomial computational complexity. This MIMO detection technique can accelerate the development of 6G mobile communication systems.</description>

      <title>Synergies Between Federated Learning and O-RAN: Towards an Elastic Architecture for Multiple Distributed Machine Learning Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning (ML) technique. However, implementation of FL over 5G-and-beyond wireless networks faces key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the wireless network conditions and (ii) the coexistence of multiple FL-services in the system, which are not jointly considered in prior works. We first take a closer look into these challenges and unveil nuanced phenomena called over-/under-provisioning of resources and perspective-driven load balancing. We then take the first steps towards addressing these phenomena by proposing a novel distributed ML architecture called elastic FL (EFL). EFL unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an elastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL-services. It further constitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three dedicated network control functionalities tailored for FL-services, including (i) non-real-time (non-RT) system descriptor, which trains ML-based applications to predicted both system and FL-related dynamics and parameters; (ii) near-RT FL controller, which handles O-RAN slicing and mobility management for the seamless execution of FL-services; (iii) FL MAC scheduler, which conducts real-time resource allocation to the end clients of various FL-services. We finally prototype EFL to demonstrate its potential in improving the performance of FL-services.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Upper Mid-Band 6G Networks: Gain or Pain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as one of the most studied topics in recent years, hailed as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize future wireless systems. While RISs are recognized for their ability to enhance spectral efficiency, coverage, and the reliability of wireless channels, several challenges remain. Notably, convincing and profitable use cases must be developed before widespread commercial deployment can be realized. The first sixth-generation (6G) networks will most likely utilize upper mid-band frequencies (i.e., 7-24\,GHz). This is regarded as the \textit{golden band} since it combines good coverage, much new spectrum, and enables many antennas in compact form factors. There has been much prior work on channel modeling, coexistence, and possible implementation scenarios for these bands. There are significant frequency-specific challenges related to RIS deployment, use cases, number of required elements, channel estimation, and control. These are previously unaddressed for the upper mid-band. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring various use cases, including RIS-assisted fixed wireless access (FWA), enhanced capacity in mobile communications, and increased reliability at the cell edge. We identify the conditions under which RIS can provide major benefits and optimal strategies for deploying RIS to enhance the performance of 6G upper mid-band communication systems.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in Random Access Networks with Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the age of information (AoI) in a random access network consisting of multiple source-destination pairs, where each source node is empowered by energy harvesting capability. Every source node transmits a sequence of data packets to its destination using only the harvested energy. Each data packet is encoded with finite-length codewords, characterizing the nature of short codeword transmissions in random access networks. By combining tools from bulk-service Markov chains with stochastic geometry, we derive an analytical expression for the network average AoI and obtain closed-form results in two special cases, i.e., the small and large energy buffer size scenarios. Our analysis reveals the trade-off between energy accumulation time and transmission success probability. We then optimize the network average AoI by jointly adjusting the update rate and the blocklength of the data packet. Our findings indicate that the optimal update rate should be set to one in the energy-constrained regime where the energy consumption rate exceeds the energy arrival rate. This also means if the optimal blocklength of the data packet is pre-configured, an energy buffer size supporting only one transmission is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Trust Assumptions on Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum security over long distances with untrusted relays is largely unfounded and is still an open question for active research. Nevertheless, quantum networks based on trusted relays are being built across the globe. However, standard QKD network architecture implores a complete trust requirement on QKD relays, which is too demanding and limits the use cases for QKD networks. In this work, we explore the possibility to securely relay a secret in a QKD network by relaxing the trust assumptions (if not completely) on the relay. We characterize QKD relays with different trust levels, namely, Full Access Trust (FAT), Partial Access Trust (PAT), and No Access Trust (NAT). As the name suggests, each level defines the degree with which a relay is required to be trusted with the secret provided by the key management system for end-to-end communication. We then review and propose multiple constructions of the QKD key management system based on the different trust levels. Main contribution of the paper is realized by evaluating key management systems with no access trust level. In principle, we review key management with centralized topology and propose a new decentralized key management system. These different topologies provide various advantages based on the QKD network requirements, allowing an operational flexibility in the architecture. We believe this work presents a new perspective to the open problem of providing a confiding and a practical solution for future long range secure communications</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Testbed for Cognitive Radio Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technological trends show that Radio Frequency Reinforcement Learning (RFRL) will play a prominent role in the wireless communication systems of the future. Applications of RFRL range from military communications jamming to enhancing WiFi networks. Before deploying algorithms for these purposes, they must be trained in a simulation environment to ensure adequate performance. For this reason, we previously created the RFRL Gym: a standardized, accessible tool for the development and testing of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the wireless communications space. This environment leveraged the OpenAI Gym framework and featured customizable simulation scenarios within the RF spectrum. However, the RFRL Gym was limited to training a single RL agent per simulation; this is not ideal, as most real-world RF scenarios will contain multiple intelligent agents in cooperative, competitive, or mixed settings, which is a natural consequence of spectrum congestion. Therefore, through integration with Ray RLlib, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) functionality for training and assessment has been added to the RFRL Gym, making it even more of a robust tool for RF spectrum simulation. This paper provides an overview of the updated RFRL Gym environment. In this work, the general framework of the tool is described relative to comparable existing resources, highlighting the significant additions and refactoring we have applied to the Gym. Afterward, results from testing various RF scenarios in the MARL environment and future additions are discussed.</description>
