      <title>Spaces of left-preorders on free products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using dynamical techniques we show that there are no isolated elements on the space of left-preorders on a free product of two groups. As a consequence, when the groups are finitely generated, this space is either empty or a Cantor set. For any subgroup of a free product having finite Kurosh rank, we develop similar results for the subspace consisting on the set of left-preorders relative to that subgroup. We provide a generating set for a certain intersection of subgroups of a free product.</description>

      <title>Finite permutation groups with quasi-semiregular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-semiregular element in a permutation group is an element that has a unique fixed point and acts semiregularly on the remaining points. Such elements were first studied in the context of automorphisms of graphs and occur naturally in many families of permutation groups, such as Frobenius and Zassenhaus groups. They also arise in the context of groups with a strongly $p$-embedded subgroup.
  We investigate the question of which finite permutation groups contain quasi-semiregular elements, with particular attention to the primitive permutation groups. We determine the O'Nan-Scott types of primitive groups that can contain quasi-semiregular elements and reduce the question to the affine and almost simple cases. In the almost simple case, we obtain a complete classification when the socle is alternating or sporadic.</description>

      <title>The conjugacy problem in Out(Fm) when the polynomial restrictions are non-growing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the conjugacy problem in Out(Fm) is solvable for the class of outer automorphisms whose restrictions to their polynomial subgroups are of finite order. To do this, we first investigate the structure of suspensions of free groups by automorphisms whose outer class is of finite order. We then apply a reduction of our main result to certain problems on groups of this form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>

      <title>Invariant subalgebras rigidity for von Neumann algebras of groups arising as certain semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ISR (von Neumann invariant subalgebra rigidity) property for certain discrete groups arising as semidirect products from algebraic actions on certain 2-torsion groups, mostly arising as direct products of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We present, in particular, the first example of an amenable group with the ISR property that admits a non-trivial abelian normal subgroup. Several other examples are discussed, notably including an infinite amenable group whose von Neumann algebra admits precisely one invariant von Neumann subalgebra which does not come from a normal subgroup. We also investigate the form of invariant subalgebras of the group von Neumann algebra of the standard lamplighter group.</description>

      <title>A coarse Halin Grid Theorem with applications to quasi-transitive, locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a coarse version of Halin's Grid Theorem: Every one-ended, locally finite graph that contains the disjoint union of infinitely many rays as an asymptotic minor also contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor. More generally, we show that the same holds for arbitrary (not necessarily one-ended or locally finite) graphs under additional, necessary assumptions on the minor-models of the infinite rays. This resolves a conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.
  As an application, we show that every one-ended, quasi-transitive, locally finite graph contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of one-ended finitely generated groups and solves a problem of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.</description>

      <title>Note on the linearisation of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $K$ is a field \textit{with enough roots of unity} and $V$ an abelian group, the $K$-algebra $K[V]$ of the group $V$ is split semisimple, so that the canonical morphism $K[V]\to K^{V^\sharp}$, where $V^\sharp$ denotes the dual group of $V$ (which may be seen as Hom$(V,K^\times)$), is an isomorphism of $K$-algebras. If one removes the assumption that $K$ has enough roots of unity, one can easily deduce from it (by using a base change and Krull-Schmidt) that it remains a $K$-linear isomorphism $K[V]\xrightarrow{\simeq} K^{V^\sharp}$ natural in the group $V$ \textit{if one restricts to finite groups $V$ canceled by a fixed nonzero integer}. The question of whether such an isomorphism, natural in the abelian group $V$, still exists without any other restriction than $V$ is finite and its order is invertible in $K$, is less obvious; we solve it positively, in a somewhat more general setting ($K$ being any commutative ring), by using Gauss sums. We also explore some related functorial questions.</description>

      <title>Ultrametric analogues of Ulam stability of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.00516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stability of metric approximations of countable groups with respect to groups endowed with ultrametrics, the main case study being a $p$-adic analogue of Ulam stability, where we take $GL_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ as approximating groups instead of $U(n)$. For finitely presented groups, the ultrametric nature implies equivalence of the pointwise and uniform stability problems, and the profinite one implies that the corresponding approximation property is equivalent to residual finiteness. Moreover, a group is uniformly stable if and only if its largest residually finite quotient is. We provide several examples of uniformly stable groups, including finite groups, virtually free groups, some groups acting on rooted trees, and certain lamplighter and (Generalised) Baumslag--Solitar groups. We construct a finitely generated group that is not uniformly stable. Finally, we prove and apply a (bounded) cohomological criterion for stability of a finitely presented group.</description>

      <title>Character estimates for finite classical groups and the asymptotic Thompson Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finite classical group, linear or unitary in any characteristic, and orthogonal in odd characteristic, we give an approximate formula for $\chi(g)$ in which the error term is much smaller than the estimate, when $g\in G$ is an element with large centralizer and $\chi\in \mathrm{Irr}(G)$ is an irreducible character of low degree. As an application, we prove Thompson's conjecture for all sufficiently large finite simple groups: each such group contains a conjugacy class whose square is the whole group.</description>

      <title>On fixed-point-free involutions in actions of finite exceptional groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial transitive permutation group on a finite set $\Omega$. By a classical theorem of Jordan, $G$ contains a derangement, which is an element with no fixed points on $\Omega$. Given a prime divisor $r$ of $|\Omega|$, we say that $G$ is $r$-elusive if it does not contain a derangement of order $r$. In a paper from 2011, Burness, Giudici and Wilson essentially reduce the classification of the $r$-elusive primitive groups to the case where $G$ is an almost simple group of Lie type. The classical groups with an $r$-elusive socle have been determined by Burness and Giudici, and in this paper we consider the analogous problem for the exceptional groups of Lie type, focussing on the special case $r=2$. Our main theorem describes all the almost simple primitive exceptional groups with a $2$-elusive socle. In other words, we determine the pairs $(G,M)$, where $G$ is an almost simple exceptional group of Lie type with socle $T$ and $M$ is a core-free maximal subgroup that intersects every conjugacy class of involutions in $T$. Our results are conclusive, with the exception of a finite list of undetermined cases for $T = E_8(q)$, which depend on the existence (or otherwise) of certain almost simple maximal subgroups of $G$ that have not yet been completely classified.</description>

      <title>On quasi-arithmeticity of hyperbolic gluings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a more general version of the gluings of hyperbolic orbifolds in the spirit of Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro, where the gluing pieces, called the building blocks, are no longer assumed to be arithmetic or incommensurable.
  We prove that if such a general hyperbolic gluing along a common finite-volume totally geodesic hypersurface is quasi-arithmetic (this is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. We also show that there exist arithmetic gluings whose building blocks are incommensurable even despite the reflection with respect to the lift of the gluing locus commensurates the fundamental group of the gluing. On the other hand, we provide an example of nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifolds such that a specific gluing of such an orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold.
  We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms, which play an important role in low-dimensional geometry and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We study algebraic aspects of generalized Legendrian racks, which are nonassociative structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles.
  Then we compute the centers of the category of GL-racks and several of its full subcategories. We also construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>
