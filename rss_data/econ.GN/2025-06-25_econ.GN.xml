      <title>International Trade and Intellectual Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intellectual property (IP) rules have the potential to shape cross-border trade far more than their legalistic origins might suggest. Drawing on three decades of evidence, this review shows that stronger IP rights simultaneously create market-power forces that raise prices and market-expansion forces that broaden demand, while dynamic incentives spur quality upgrading and new export varieties. Micro-data and quasi-natural experiments after TRIPS reveal that IP most often boosts trade along the extensive margin and redirects some activity toward licensing and foreign investment. Policy bundling and measurement gaps on the strength of IP rights still cloud causal inference. Future work must map intangible flows and enforcement quality to capture the digital, data-driven frontier of international commerce.</description>

      <title>Experiential marketing strategy and tourism demand in the contribution of the positioning of the floating islands Los Uros, Puno</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiential focused on creating memorable and meaningful experiences for consumers, has emerged as a key strategy in promoting tourist destinations. particularly in destinations seeking to highlight their unique cultural characteristics. In this study, the influence of experiential marketing on the tourism demand of the floating islands Los Uros, Puno, an emblematic destination in Peru, is analyzed. The objective of the research was to evaluate how experiential marketing strategies impact tourism demand in this destination, focusing on the sensorial, affective and thought experiences that tourists perceive. The methodology adopted a quantitative approach, with a non experimental cross-sectional design, descriptive scope and a correlational analysis. The study population consisted of 158 tourists. To collect the data, a questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale was used, with a total of 21 items. Among the results, a significant positive correlation was found (r = 0.809, p &lt; 0.001) between experiential marketing and tourism demand. Sensory (r = 0.780, p &lt; 0.001), affective (r = 0.772, p &lt; 0.001) and thought (r = 0.797, p &lt; 0.001) were described as determining factors in tourists' decisions when visiting Los Uros. In addition, the multiple regression analysis indicated that experiential marketing explains 83% of the variability in tourism demand. In conclusion, experiential marketing strategies have a significant impact on tourism demand. It is recommended that marketing managers of Los Uros Island implement tactics that promote memorable experiences, prioritizing strategies that involve experiences that stimulate the thinking and emotions of tourists.</description>

      <title>Self-selection of Information and Belief Update: An Experiment on COVID-19 Vaccine Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational information acquisition theory predicts that people select the more informative information. Thus, people's beliefs will be more persuaded by the information they select. We test the prediction in a critical real-world context -- information about COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted an online experiment in Taiwan where the subjects selected information about COVID-19 vaccines, and then the subjects updated their beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and references to vaccines. As our design distinguishes different stages of the rational acquisition framework, it allows us to diagnose the underlying mechanism of the theory. Our empirical findings demonstrate evidence that people's information acquisition generally coheres with the rational theory framework predictions; that is, people choose information when the information is more likely to alter their decisions. We show that our subjects' beliefs change more when they see the information they select. We also find evidence of change in vaccine preferences and choices after they receive the information they select, which further suggests that the subjects follow the rational information acquisition framework.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Air Pollution on Teenagers' Cognitive Performance: Evidence from School Leaving Examination in Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random disturbances such as air pollution may affect cognitive performance, which, particularly in high-stakes settings, may have severe consequences for an individual's productivity and well-being. This paper examines the short-term effects of air pollution on school leaving exam results in Poland. I exploit random variation in air pollution between the days on which exams are held across three consecutive school years. I aim to capture this random variation by including school and time fixed effects. The school-level panel data is drawn from a governmental program where air pollution is continuously measured in the schoolyard. This localized hourly air pollution measure is a unique feature of my study, which increases the precision of the estimated effects. In addition, using distant and aggregated air pollution measures allows me for the comparison of the estimates in space and time. The findings suggest that a one standard deviation increase in the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 decreases students' exam scores by around 0.07-0.08 standard deviations. The magnitude and significance of these results depend on the location and timing of the air pollution readings, indicating the importance of the localized air pollution measure and the distinction between contemporaneous and lingering effects. Further, air pollution effects gradually increase in line with the quantiles of the exam score distribution, suggesting that high-ability students are more affected by the random disturbances caused by air pollution.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>
