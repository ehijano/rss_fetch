      <title>Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation from uncertain data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of inclusive processes that involve the production of many particles is a challenge for lattice QCD, a Euclidean-space method that is far removed from real-time, multiparticle production. A new approach to this problem based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation has been proposed by Bergamaschi et al. Here we extend their method by exploring the propagation of the statistical and systematic errors that accompany a lattice QCD calculation through this interpolation process. A simplified example of a multiparticle spectral function is studied with a focus on the possible applications of these methods to the calculation of inclusive heavy-particle decays.</description>

      <title>Finite-length flux tube in the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory on the dual lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory is one of the nonperturbative effective field theories of QCD. The DGL theory describes the QCD vacuum as a dual superconductor and possesses electric flux-tube solutions via the dual Meissner effect, which applies to the quark confinement mechanism. We demonstrate a powerful numerical method for solving the field equations in the DGL theory with U(1) dual gauge symmetry. An essential aspect of our method is to formulate the DGL theory on the dual lattice, which enables us to investigate any system composed of finite-length flux tubes in a systematic manner. Taking full advantage of the dual lattice formulation, we investigate the finite-length flux-tube solution corresponding to the quark-antiquark system in detail, which exposes the significant terminal effects absent in the infinitely long flux-tube solution. We also study the flux-tube interaction in the two- and multi-flux-tube systems, providing new insights into the nonperturbative properties of QCD.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous global QCD analysis of kaon and pion parton distributions with lattice QCD constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of pion and kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), constrained by pion- and kaon-induced Drell-Yan (DY) and leading neutron electroproduction data, together with lattice QCD data on pion and kaon PDF moments. The analysis indicates a softer valence $\bar u$ distribution in the $K^-$ than in the $\pi^-$, and a significantly more peaked valence $s$-quark density in $K^-$ compared with the $\bar u$. The effective exponent governing the high-$x$ behavior of the PDF is found to be larger for $\bar u$ in the kaon, $\beta_{\bar u}^{K^-}\!= 1.6(2)$, than in the pion, $\beta_{\bar u}^{\pi^-}\!= 1.16(4)$, in the range $0.7 \leq x \leq 0.95$. From the gluon momentum fractions we find the pion's gluon content accounts for $\approx 1/3$ of the mass budget of the pion at $\mu=2~{\rm GeV}$, but only $\approx 1/4$ for the kaon.</description>

      <title>Gradient-flowed operator product expansion without IR renormalons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem concerns the question how to consistently combine perturbative expansions in QCD with power corrections in the context of the operator product expansion (OPE), since the former exhibit ambiguities due to infrared renormalons, which are of the same order as the power corrections. We propose to use the gradient flow time $1/\sqrt{t}$ as a factorization scale and to express the OPE in terms of IR renormalon-free subtracted perturbative expansions and unambiguous matrix elements of gradient-flow regularized local operators. We show on the example of the Adler function and its leading power correction from the gluon condensate that this method dramatically improves the convergence of the perturbative expansion. We employ lattice data on the action density to estimate the gradient-flowed gluon condensate, and obtain the Adler function with non-perturbative accuracy and significantly reduced theoretical uncertainty, enlarging the predictivity at low $Q^2$. When applied to the hadronic decay width of the tau lepton, the method resolves the long-standing discrepancy between the fixed-order and contour-improved approach in favour of the fixed-order treatment.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Formulation of Path Integrals in Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for Galerkin formulations of path integrals in lattice field theory. The framework is based on using the degrees of freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice variables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the partition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of freedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the two-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on the domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this satisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the continuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order formulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite element spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and numerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the order of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of lattice observables. Finally, we sketch an outline of this Galerkin framework in the context of gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupled-channel models for hadron dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</description>
