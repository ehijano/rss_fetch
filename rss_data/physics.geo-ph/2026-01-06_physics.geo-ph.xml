      <title>Rainfall-induced Mass Movement as Self-organization Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organizing processes shape Earth's surface, creating complex patterns from simple rules in most landforms. Rainfall-induced mass movements dramatically reshape landscapes through rapid sediment transfer, but whether they self-organize remains unknown. Here we decode their organizational principles by treating spatial changes in scar geometries as fingerprints of the movement process. In 65,936 scars worldwide, we discovered three geometric signals from width, sinuosity and curvature converge on shared patterns and identify a slow-to-fast hierarchy characteristic of self-organizing landforms: long-range correlations show width retaining spatial memory while curvature decorrelates quickly; power spectra quantify a 4-3-2 hierarchy (width-sinuosity-curvature) in scaling exponents; and information flow confirms a top-down organization (width-sinuosity-curvature). Although entropy increases toward finer scales, phase-space reconstructions settle on low-dimensional attractors, revealing hidden order. Together, the evidence shows that width establishes flow corridors through slow dynamics, sinuosity mediates momentum and gravity by intermediate adjustments, and curvature responds rapidly to the terrain. We also developed a model based on simple terrain-inertia trade-offs, demonstrating how mass movements maintain large-scale coherence while flexibly navigating obstacles, potentially extending run-out distances. This organizing rule offers a fundamental mechanism for predicting the destructive reach of mass movements, which are intensifying in our warming, wetter world.</description>

      <title>Trigger excitation of "pearls" in the Earth's magnetosphere: On the 90th anniversary of the discovery of Pc1 waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-frequency electromagnetic waves Pc1 (0.2-5 Hz), widely known in the literature as pearls, are excited in the outer radiation belt and propagate to the Earth along the geomagnetic field lines in the form of Alfven waves. The study of pearls is of considerable interest for magnetospheric physics. Both spontaneous and stimulated pearl excitation are observed. The paper examines stimulated (trigger) excitation of pearls. A classification of triggers acting on dynamic systems of the magnetosphere is presented. 2 types, 4 classes and 8 species of triggers have been introduced. Examples of triggers of natural and artificial origin are given. The concept of a trigger cascade is introduced. Particular attention is paid to the anthropogenic periodic trigger of pearls. It manifests itself in the form of the so-called Big Ben effect. The essence of the effect is that a series of pearls is often excited immediately following the hour marker according to world time. It is claimed that the connection between the excitation of pearls and hour markers is not accidental, but represents a rather mysterious geophysical phenomenon. It is assumed that the Big Ben effect occurs as a result of the impact on the radiation belt of an unknown type of endogenous periodic artificial trigger. Key words: oscillations and waves, Alfven waves, ion-cyclotron resonator, radiation belt, instability, classification, natural and artificial, technosphere, Big Ben effect.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Solution to the Optimal Spherical Dubins Path Problem with Geodesic Curvature Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing shortest paths for curvature-constrained Dubins vehicles on the unit sphere is fundamental to many engineering applications, including long-range flight planning, persistent surveillance patterns, and global routing problems where great circles are natural routes. Numerical optimization methods on $\SO(3)$ suffer from sensitivity to initialization, may converge to local minima, and often miss feasible solution branches. This paper proposes a unified analytic computational approach for spherical Dubins CGC and CCC paths that overcomes these limitations. By exploiting the axis-fixing property of rotations and developing a closed-form back-substitution method using geometric projection, the three-dimensional boundary value problem is reduced to solving a quadratic polynomial equation. The proposed analytic solver achieves machine precision accuracy with errors on the order of $10^{-16}$, is approximately $717$ times faster than numerical methods under the same computational environment, and systematically enumerates all feasible solution branches without requiring exhaustive multi-start initialization. The method provides closed-form solutions for optimal path computation in the regime where turning radius $\Rturn \in (0, 1/2]$, corresponding to $U_{\max} \geq \sqrt{3}$.</description>

      <title>Feature-based Inversion of 2.5D Controlled Source Electromagnetic Data using Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate feature-based 2.5D controlled source marine electromagnetic (mCSEM) data inversion using generative priors. Two-and-half dimensional modeling using finite difference method (FDM) is adopted to compute the response of horizontal electric dipole (HED) excitation. Rather than using a neural network to approximate the entire inverse mapping in a black-box manner, we adopt a plug-andplay strategy in which a variational autoencoder (VAE) is used solely to learn prior information on conductivity distributions. During the inversion process, the conductivity model is iteratively updated using the Gauss Newton method, while the model space is constrained by projections onto the learned VAE decoder. This framework preserves explicit control over data misfit and enables flexible adaptation to different survey configurations. Numerical and field experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively incorporates prior information, improves reconstruction accuracy, and exhibits good generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence of inertia--gravity waves: a theory for the oceanic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a derivation using kinetic wave theory of the two-dimensional empirical Garrett--Munk spectrum for ocean internal waves, valid at all frequencies including near-inertial frequencies. This is based directly on the governing equations for a two-dimensional Boussinesq system with constant stratification and rotation. Our results improve on previous work by side-stepping the use of canonical variables, by taking full account of the Coriolis parameter in a non-hydrostatic dispersion relation, by filtering the balanced flow component from the dynamics, by using the conservation laws for energy and two components of pseudomomentum to bring the collision integral into a very simple form, by giving precise convergence conditions for the collision integral, and by finding the unique scale-invariant turbulent wave spectrum that corresponds to turbulent fluxes from small to large wavenumbers. The last step was achieved in the limit of small but nonzero Coriolis parameter.
  Key results are that any nonzero Coriolis parameter regularizes the singular nature of the non-rotating problem and that the homogeneity properties of the dispersion relation and of the interaction coefficients alone already imply that the spectrum is separable in vertical wavenumber and frequency. Within the restrictions of two-dimensional dynamics, this provides a theoretical framework for internal-wave turbulence consistent with oceanic observations.</description>

      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here, we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>

      <title>FormationEval, an open multiple-choice benchmark for petroleum geoscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FormationEval, an open multiple-choice question benchmark for evaluating language models on petroleum geoscience and subsurface disciplines. The dataset contains 505 questions across seven domains including petrophysics, petroleum geology and reservoir engineering, derived from three authoritative sources using a reasoning model with detailed instructions and a concept-based approach that avoids verbatim copying of copyrighted text. Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97\% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8\%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6\%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93\%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90\% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance. Residual length bias in the dataset (correct answers tend to be longer) is documented along with bias mitigation strategies applied during construction. The benchmark, evaluation code and results are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Did lunar tides sustain the early Earth's dynamo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geological data show that, early in its history, the Earth had a large-scale magnetic field with an amplitude comparable to the one of the present geomagnetic field. However, its origin remains enigmatic and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the Earth's field over geological time scales. Here, we critically evaluate whether tidal forcing could explain the ancient geodynamo, by combining constraints from geophysical models of the Earth-Moon system and predictions from turbulence studies. Our analysis shows that lunar tidal forcing could have been sufficiently strong before $-3.25$ Gy to trigger turbulence within the Earth's core, and potentially to sustain dynamo action during that interval. Then, we propose new scaling laws for the magnetic field amplitude $B$. We expect the latter to scale as $B \propto \beta^{4/3}$, where $\beta$ is the equatorial ellipticity of the liquid core, if the turbulence involves weak interactions of three-dimensional inertial waves. Alternatively, in the regime of strong tidal forcing, the expected scaling becomes $B \propto \beta$. When extrapolated to the Earth's core, it suggests that tidal forcing alone was too weak to possibly explain the ancient geomagnetic field. Therefore, our study indirectly favours another origin for the early Earth's dynamo on long time scales (e.g. exsolution of light elements atop the core, or thermal convection due to secular cooling).</description>

      <title>The InSAR absolute phase amid singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radar interferometric absolute phase is essential for estimating topography and displacements. However, its conventional definition based on the range difference is idealized in that it cannot be applied to complex, dynamic targets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is easiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is determined by temporally unwrapping the phase while continuously varying the intermediate acquisition time between primary and secondary acquisitions. This absolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series of observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is proportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For general targets undergoing a cyclic change, the absolute phase may be nonzero and then cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity (vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase becomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute phase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through multifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional interferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths need to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer multiples of $2 \pi$. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for unwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase singularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute phase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR processing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low coherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the soil and atmospheric stress on carbon sequestration in a Mediterranean pine forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$ in a Mediterranean semi-arid Aleppo Pine Forest (Pinus halepensis) close to the border of the semi-arid timberline was characterized and quantified under field conditions. Measurements of organic and inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration with gas exchange and stock counting approaches were made in both rainfed control (approximately 12$\%$ average annual soil moisture) and summer irrigated plots (approximately 24$\%$ annual average soil moisture), providing the opportunity to separate the effects of atmospheric water demand from soil water stress on the atmospheric CO$_2$ sequestration responses. Measurements yield an organic carbon sequestration (OCS) rate of approximately 550 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, two-thirds in soil and one-third in biomass. In addition, measurements yield an inorganic carbon sequestration (ICS) rate of approximately 216 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$; via calcite (CaCO$_3$) precipitation in the soil due to root exhalation of CO$_2$ (60$\%$) and microbial activity (40$\%$). The drip irrigated plot showed approximately 3 times higher organic CO$_2$ sequestration than the control plot. The organic sequestration is divided equally between the soil and the biomass. For the irrigated plot, the inorganic CO$_2$ was approximately 1.8 times higher than that of the control plot. However, for inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration, the soil moisture would need to be maintained lower than that of the study plot to preclude dissolving precipitated calcite. For many drylands, irrigation could be achieved by using fossil water reserves. These measured values demonstrate the relatively high potential carbon sequestration in Mediterranean drylands forests under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions.</description>

Abstract: A critical review of artificial intelligence and deep machine learning (AI/ML) applied to downscaling of global climate model simulations provides some words of caution, based on past experiences and well-established principles. Recent papers tend to ignore more subtle successes with statistics and mathematical based downscaling, and there are examples of inappropriate evaluation strategies and incomplete accounts of the scientific progress when it comes to climate downscaling. An incomplete description state-of-the-art and a dogmatic approach to evaluation may give a deceiving impression that AI/ML is superior to more statistics and mathematics based methods.</description>

      <title>Climatic Extremes in Brazil: a parallel analysis of Historical Trends and Socioeconomical Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important consequence of human induced climate change is the increase in extreme weather events. This study contributes to the understanding of Brazil's climate change by examining historical temperature and precipitation patterns. Extreme events of temperature and precipitation are identified using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes records from 634 meteorological stations operating intermittently since 1961. Using the first 30 years (1961 to 1990) as the reference period, our results show a significant increase in warm days and a corresponding decrease in cold days over the last 30 years (1991 to 2020), in agreement with previous works. In terms of precipitation, it indicates a trend toward drier conditions in the Northeast region of Brazil, whereas the South is experiencing wetter conditions, with an increase in the number of heavy precipitation days in South and in the extremely dry periods in the Northeast. These results have been verified for consistency with several extreme climate indices measured in this study. Additionally, data from S2iD is analyzed, an official database that records natural disasters in Brazil, to estimate their impact in terms of human losses and financial costs over the past decade. Our findings indicate that drought events are the most economically costly, with multiple instances causing damages exceeding a billion USD, whereas storms have the greatest impact on people. Although it is not possible to directly attribute the natural disasters recorded in the S2iD database to the extreme weather events identified through meteorological data, discussion is done on potential implications of these events in the frequency and location of the disasters.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description>
