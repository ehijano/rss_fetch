      <title>Diffraction and pseudospectra in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave dynamics in disordered open media is an intriguing topic, and has lately attracted a lot of attention in non-Hermitian physics, especially in photonics. In fact, spatial distributions of gain and loss elements are physically possible in the context of integrated photonic waveguide arrays. In particular, in these type of lattices, counter-intuitive quantized jumps along the propagation direction appear in the strong disorder limit (where all eigenstates are localized) and they have also been recently experimentally observed. We systematically study the non-Hermitian quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site gain and loss distribution (NHAAH), with an emphasis on the spectral sensitivity based on pseudospectra analysis. Moreover, diffraction dynamics and the quantized jumps, as well as, the effect of saturable nonlinearity, are investigated in detail. Our study reveals the intricate relation between the nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Forces of Nonequilibria from Two Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-EQuilibrium (NEQ) statistical physics has not had the same depth of rigor and generality of foundational grounding as that of EQuilibrium (EQ) statistical physics, where forces and fluctuational response functions are derived from potentials such as $1/T = \partial S/\partial U$ and where conjugate variables are related through Maxwell's Relations. Here, we show that the dynamical counterparts to the First and Second Laws for equilibria -- maximizing path entropies, not state entropies, for the latter -- give the full set of corresponding relations for NEQ. Network flows parse into three functional independent components: node populations, edge traffic and cycle flux. We also generalize to "cost-benefit" relations beyond just work and heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>A modified cellular automaton using activation and inhibition regions geometrically compatible with biaxial anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young's cellular automaton, recently applied to study the spatiotemporal evolution of binary patterns for favorable/hostile environments, has now been modified from a different point of view. In this model, each differentiated cell (DC) produces two diffusing morphogens: a short-range activator and a long-range inhibitor. Their combination creates the so-called local 'w' field. Undifferentiated cells (UCs) are passive. The question arises how to adapt it to modelling patterning processes in anisotropic substrates with a biaxial dependence of the morphogen diffusion rate. We use activation/inhibition regions with appropriate shape geometry defined by the so-called deformation parameter p. We complement this model by adding a physically reasonable transition zone with controlled local field slope. The patterning process uses the morphogenetic field W calculated separately for each cell, which is the sum of the 'w' values generated by all regional DCs surrounding the cell. It acts as a chemical signal determining the next state of the cell. We also introduce a threshold W* defining the required absolute chemical signal strength. The state of each cell can change depending on the rules for W and W*. This improves the stability of the model evolution and extends its applications. Using two pairs of two-point orthogonal correlation functions, we reveal their directional sensitivity to changes in biaxial anisotropy. Finally, we illustrate the general two-parameter dependence of the average final DC concentration on the geometry of the activation/inhibition regions and on the value of the long-range inhibitor. This facilitates the recognition of characteristic features of the evolution of DC concentration in our model.</description>

      <title>A physical random walk for space-fractional diffusion on finite domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a compounded random walk that is physically well defined on both finite and infinite domains, and samples space-dependent forces throughout jumps. The governing evolution equation for the walk limits to a space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation valid on bounded domains, and recovers the well known superdiffusive space-fractional diffusion equation on infinite domains. This compounded random walk, and its associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation, provides a major advance for modelling space-fractional diffusion through potential fields and on finite domains.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of Markov models for image generation with applications to spin-flip dynamics and to diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Markov models for image generation, the main idea is to learn how non-trivial images are gradually destroyed by a trivial forward Markov dynamics over the large time window $[0,t]$ converging towards pure noise for $t \to + \infty$, and to implement the non-trivial backward time-dependent Markov dynamics over the same time window $[0,t]$ starting from pure noise at $t$ in order to generate new images at time $0$. The goal of the present paper is to analyze the convergence properties of this reconstructive backward dynamics as a function of the time $t$ using the spectral properties of the trivial continuous-time forward dynamics for the $N$ pixels $n=1,..,N$. The general framework is applied to two cases : (i) when each pixel $n$ has only two states $S_n=\pm 1$ with Markov jumps between them; (ii) when each pixel $n$ is characterized by a continuous variable $x_n$ that diffuses on an interval $]x_-,x_+[$ that can be either finite or infinite.</description>

      <title>Shear-Driven Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External flows, such as shear flow, add directional biases to particle motion, introducing anisotropic behavior into the system. Here, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics that emerge from the interplay between linear shear flow and stochastic resetting. The particle diffuses with a constant diffusion coefficient while simultaneously experiencing linear shear and being stochastically returned to its initial position at a constant rate. We perturbatively derive the steady-state probability distribution that captures the effects of shear-induced anisotropy on the spatial structure of the distribution. We show that the dynamics perform a crossover from a diffusive to a super-diffusive regime, which cease to exist in the absence of shear flow. We also show that the skewness has a non-monotonic behavior when one passes from the shear-dominated to the resetting-dominated regime. We demonstrate that at small resetting rates, while resetting events are rare, they incur a large energetic cost to sustain the non-equilibrium steady state. Surprisingly, if only the $x$-position is reset, the system never reaches a steady state but instead spreads diffusively.</description>

      <title>Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics and crystalline local order in two-dimensional amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reassess the modeling of amorphous silica bilayers as a two-dimensional classical system whose particles interact with an effective pairwise potential. We show that it is possible to reparameterize the potential developed by Roy, Heyde, and Heuer to quantitatively match the structural details of the experimental samples. We then study the glassy dynamics of the reparameterized model at low temperatures. Using appropriate cage-relative correlation functions, which suppress the effect of Mermin-Wagner fluctuations, we highlight the presence of two well-defined Arrhenius regimes separated by a narrow crossover region, which we connect to the thermodynamic anomalies and the changes in the local structure. We find that the bond-orientational order grows steadily below the crossover temperature and is associated to transient crystalline domains of nanometric size. These findings raise fundamental questions about the nature of glass structure in two dimensions and provide guidelines to interpret the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Generalized time-fractional kinetic-type equations with multiple parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a new generalization of the kinetic equation emerging in run-and-tumble models. We show that this generalization leads to a wide class of generalized fractional kinetic (GFK) and telegraph-type equations depending by two (or three) parameters. We provide an explicit expression of the solution in the Laplace domain and show that, for a particular choice of the parameters, the fundamental solution of the GFK equation can be interpreted as the probability density function of a stochastic process obtained by a suitable transformation of the inverse of a subordinator. Then, we discuss some particular interesting cases, such as generalized telegraph models, diffusion fractional equations involving higher order time derivatives and fractional integral equations.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Quantum States and Universal Correlations in a Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over a 1D Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain settles into a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. Thus, the interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that steady-state probabilities of a nonequilibrium Markovian system can be reconstructed from a weighted ensemble average of finite-time loop-erased paths. Each path $\Gamma$ is weighted by $e^{-S(\Gamma)}$, where $S(\Gamma)$ can be interpreted either as the action functional or as the entropy change in the surrounding reservoirs. In doing so, we uncover a Jarzynski-type equality for nonequilibrium steady states. We also reveal that the probabilities of loop-erased paths obey strong thermodynamic symmetry relations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the topological sector optimization on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04291v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems are the core challenge in many fields of science and engineering, yet general and effective methods are scarce for searching optimal solutions. Quantum computing has been envisioned to help solve such problems, for example, the quantum annealing (QA) method based on adiabatic evolution has been extensively explored and successfully implemented on quantum simulators such as D-wave's annealers and some Rydberg arrays. In this work, we investigate topological sector optimization (TSO) problem, which attracts particular interests in the quantum many-body physics community. We reveal that the topology induced by frustration in the spin model is an intrinsic obstruction for QA and other traditional methods to approach the ground state. We demonstrate that the optimization difficulties of TSO problem are not restricted to the gaplessness, but are also due to the topological nature which are often ignored for the analysis of optimization problems before. To solve TSO problems, we utilize quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) with a possible realization on quantum computers, which exploits the property of quantum superposition to explore the full Hilbert space and can thus address optimization problems of topological nature. We report the performance of different quantum optimization algorithms on TSO problems and demonstrate that their capability to address optimization problems are distinct even when considering the quantum computational resources required for practical QITE implementations.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking via Wightman Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in quantum many-body physics, and a central concept is spontaneous symmetry breaking, which imposes crucial constraints on the possible quantum phases and their transitions. Recent developments have extended the discussion of symmetry and its breaking to mixed states, enhancing our understanding of novel quantum phases that have no counterpart in pure states. Specific attention has been paid to scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking to weak symmetry, characterized by the fidelity correlator. In this work, we propose the Wightman correlator as an alternative diagnostic tool. This construction relies on the introduction of the thermofield double state for a generic density matrix, which maps the strong symmetry of the density matrix to the doubled symmetry of the pure state, allowing the Wightman correlator to emerge naturally as a standard probe of symmetry breaking. We prove the equivalence between the Wightman function and the fidelity correlator in defining strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and examine explicit examples involving spin glasses, thermal density matrices, and the decohered Ising model. Additionally, we discuss a susceptibility interpretation of the Wightman correlator.</description>

      <title>Discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal system with directional interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.</description>

      <title>Inference of non-exponential kinetics through stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an inference scheme of long timescale, non-exponential kinetics from Molecular Dynamics simulations accelerated by stochastic resetting. Standard simulations provide valuable insight into chemical processes but are limited to timescales shorter than $\sim 1 \mu s$. Slower processes require the use of enhanced sampling methods to expedite them, and inference schemes to obtain the unbiased kinetics. However, most kinetics inference schemes assume an underlying exponential first-passage time distribution and are inappropriate for other distributions, e.g., with a power-law decay. We propose an inference scheme that is designed for such cases, based on simulations enhanced by stochastic resetting. We show that resetting promotes enhanced sampling of the first-passage time distribution at short timescales, but often also provides sufficient information to estimate the long-time asymptotics, which allows the kinetics inference. We apply our method to a model system and a short peptide in an explicit solvent, successfully estimating the unbiased mean first-passage time while accelerating the sampling by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Sudden change in entanglement Hamiltonian: Phase diagram of an Ising entanglement Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The form of the entanglement Hamiltonian varies with the parameters of the original system. Whether there is a singularity is the key problem for demonstrating/negating the universality of the relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum. We carefully study the phase diagram of a 1D Ising entanglement Hamiltonian as an example to clarify the long-standing controversy of the general relation between the entanglement Hamiltonian and original Hamiltonian. Interestingly, even if the singularities indeed exist, the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, i.e., the general relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum, seemingly still holds.</description>

      <title>Why hyperdensity functionals describe any equilibrium observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recent hyperdensity functional theory for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of soft matter systems [F. Samm\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.098201]. Hyperdensity functionals give access to the behaviour of arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. The approach is based on classical density functional theory applied to an extended ensemble using standard functional techniques. The associated formally exact generalized Mermin-Evans functional relationships can be represented efficiently by neural functionals. These neural networks are trained via simulation-based supervised machine learning and they allow one to carry out efficient functional calculus using automatic differentiation and numerical functional line integration. Exact sum rules, including hard wall contact theorems and hyperfluctuation Ornstein-Zernike equations, interrelate the different correlation functions. We lay out close connections to hyperforce correlation sum rules [S. Robitschko et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 103 (2024); 10.1038/s42005-024-01568-y] that arise from statistical mechanical gauge invariance [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (to appear); arXiv:2406.19235]. Further quantitative measures of collective self-organization are provided by hyperdirect correlation functionals and spatially resolved hyperfluctuation profiles. The theory facilitates to gain deep insight into the inherent structuring mechanisms that govern the behaviour of both simple and complex order parameters in coupled many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherence properties are central to quantum systems and are at the heart of phenomena such as superconductivity. Here we study coherence properties of an ultracold Bose gas in a two-dimensional optical lattice across the thermal phase transition. To infer the phase coherence and phase fluctuation profile, we use direct matter-wave imaging of higher Talbot revivals as well as a new phase microscope based on a site-resolved mapping of phase fluctuations to density fluctuations during matter-wave imaging. We observe the algebraic decay of the phase correlations in the superfluid phase and a linear temperature increase of the exponent. These techniques will also allow studying coherence properties in strongly-correlated quantum systems with full spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>The fluctuation-dissipation relation holds for a macroscopic tracer in an active bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) links thermal fluctuations and dissipation at thermal equilibrium through temperature. Extending it beyond equilibrium conditions in pursuit of broadening thermodynamics is often feasible, albeit with system-dependent specific conditions. We demonstrate experimentally that a generalized FDR holds for a harmonically trapped tracer colliding with self-propelled walkers. The generalized FDR remains valid across a large spectrum of active fluctuation frequencies, extending from underdamped to critically damped dynamics, which we attribute to a single primary channel for energy input and dissipation in our system.</description>

      <title>Testing the Instanton Approach to the Large Amplification Limit of a Diffraction-Amplification Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of the instanton analysis approach is tested numerically in the case of the diffraction-amplification problem $\partial_z\psi -\frac{i}{2m}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi =g\vert S\vert^2\, \psi$ for $\ln U\gg 1$, where $U=\vert\psi(0,L)\vert^2$. Here, $S(x,z)$ is a complex Gaussian random field, $z$ and $x$ respectively are the axial and transverse coordinates, with $0\le z\le L$, and both $m\ne 0$ and $g&gt;0$ are real parameters. We consider a class of $S$, called the `one-max class', for which we devise a specific biased sampling procedure. As an application, $p(U)$, the probability distribution of $U$, is obtained down to values less than $10^{-2270}$ in the far right tail. We find that the agreement of our numerical results with the instanton analysis predictions in Mounaix (2023 {\it J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.} {\bf 56} 305001) is remarkable. Both the predicted algebraic tail of $p(U)$ and concentration of the realizations of $S$ onto the leading instanton are clearly confirmed, which validates the instanton analysis numerically in the large $\ln U$ limit for $S$ in the one-max class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Fokker-Planck equation for joint probability density for an active particle coupled two heat reservoirs with harmonic, viscous, random forces. The approximate solution for the joint distribution density of all-to-all and three others topologies is solved, which apply an exponential correlated Gaussian force in three-time regions of correlation time. Mean squared displacement, velocity behaviors in the form of super-diffusion, while the mean squared displacement, velocity has the Gaussian form, normal diffusion. Concomitantly, the Kurtosis, correlation coefficient, and moment from moment equation are approximately and numerically calculated.
  In this paper, we derive an altered Fokker-Planck equation for an active particle with the harmonic, viscous, and random forces, coupled to two heat reservoirs. We attain the solution for the joint distribution density of our topology, including the center topology, the ring topology, and the chain topology, subject to an exponential correlated Gaussian force. The mean squared displacement and the mean squared velocity behavior as the super-diffusions in the short-time domain and for the characteristic time=0, while those have the Gaussian forms in the long-time domain and for the characteristic time=0. We concomitantly calculate and analyze the non-equilibrium characteristics of the kurtosis, the correlation coefficient, and the moment from the derived moment equation.</description>

Compared with the self-propelled particle, the mean squared tangential velocity is matched with the same value to the time ~t^2, while the mean squared radial velocity is the same as the time ~t.</description>

      <title>Optimizing search processes in systems with state toggling: exact condition delimiting the efficacy of stochastic resetting strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Will the strategy of resetting help a stochastic process to reach its target efficiently, with its environment continually toggling between a strongly favourable and an unfavourable (or weakly favourable) state? A diffusive run-and-tumble motion, or motion under flashing optical traps are special examples of such state toggling. For any general process with toggling under Poisson reset, we derive a mathematical condition for continuous transitions where the advantage rendered by resetting vanishes. For the case of diffusive motion with linear potentials of unequal strength, we present exact solutions which reveal that there is quite generically a re-entrance of the advantage of resetting as a function of the strength of the strongly favourable potential. This result is shown to be valid for quadratic potential traps by using the general condition of transition.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Active fractal networks with stochastic force monopoles and force dipoles: Application to subdiffusion of chromosomal loci</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the well-known fractal packing of chromatin, we study the Rouse-type dynamics of elastic fractal networks with embedded, stochastically driven, active force monopoles and force dipoles that are temporally correlated. We compute, analytically -- using a general theoretical framework -- and {\it via} Langevin dynamics simulations, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a network bead. Following a short-time superdiffusive behavior, force monopoles yield anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent identical to that of the thermal system. In contrast, force dipoles do not induce subdiffusion, and the early superdiffusive MSD crosses over to a relatively small, system-size-independent saturation value. In addition, we find that force dipoles may lead to "crawling" rotational motion of the whole network, reminiscent of that found for triangular micro-swimmers and consistent with general theories of the rotation of deformable bodies. Moreover, force dipoles lead to network collapse beyond a critical force strength, which persists with increasing system size, signifying a true first-order dynamical phase transition. We apply our results to the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast cells' chromatin, where anomalous sub-diffusion, MSD$\sim t^{\nu}$ with $\nu\simeq 0.4$, was found in both normal and ATP-depleted cells, albeit with different apparent diffusion coefficients. We show that the combination of thermal, monopolar, and dipolar forces in chromatin is typically dominated by the active monopolar and thermal forces, explaining the observed normal cells vs the ATP-depleted cells behavior.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss rapidly rotating states of a superfluid. We concentrate on the Giant-Vortex (GV) state, which is a coherent rotating solution with a macroscopic hole at the center. We show that, for any trap, the fluctuations obey an approximately chiral dispersion relation, describing arbitrary shape deformations moving with the speed of the ambient superfluid. This dispersion relation is a consequence of a peculiar infinite symmetry group that emerges at large angular velocity and implies an infinite ground-state degeneracy. The degeneracy is lifted by small corrections which we determine both for smooth traps and the hard trap.</description>

      <title>Creating and controlling global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement on quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schr\"{o}dinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and, more attractively, in future quantum technologies such as fault-tolerant quantum computation. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a new perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.</description>

      <title>Matrix denoising: Bayes-optimal estimators via low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the additive version of the matrix denoising problem, where a random symmetric matrix $S$ of size $n$ has to be inferred from the observation of $Y=S+Z$, with $Z$ an independent random matrix modeling a noise. For prior distributions of $S$ and $Z$ that are invariant under conjugation by orthogonal matrices we determine, using results from first and second order free probability theory, the Bayes-optimal (in terms of the mean square error) polynomial estimators of degree at most $D$, asymptotically in $n$, and show that as $D$ increases they converge towards the estimator introduced by Bun, Allez, Bouchaud and Potters in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62, 7475 (2016)]. We conjecture that this optimality holds beyond strictly orthogonally invariant priors, and provide partial evidences of this universality phenomenon when $S$ is an arbitrary Wishart matrix and $Z$ is drawn from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, a case motivated by the related extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters $N$ and $N_{f}$ in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Recursive algorithm for generating high-temperature expansions for spin systems and the chiral non-linear susceptibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the high-temperature expansion of the free energy and arbitrary imaginary-time-ordered connected correlation functions of quantum spin systems can be recursively obtained from the exact renormalization group flow equation for the generating functional of connected spin correlation functions derived by Krieg and Kopietz [Phys. Rev. B 99, 060403(R) (2019)]. Our recursive algorithm can be explicitly written down in closed form including all combinatorial factors. We use our method to estimate critical temperatures of Heisenberg magnets from low-order truncations of the inverse spin susceptibility in the static limit. We also calculate the connected correlation function involving three different spin components (chiral non-linear susceptibility) of quantum Heisenberg magnets up to second order in the exchange couplings.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Transport through Evolving Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap is associated with the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix in the internal space, which then reflects its purity. Therefore, the overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A note on defect stability in $d=4-\varepsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the space of scalar line, surface and interface defect field theories in $d=4-\varepsilon$ by examining their stability properties under generic deformations. Examples are known of multiple stable line defect Conformal Field Theories (dCFTs) existing simultaneously, unlike the case of normal multiscalar field theories where a theorem by Michel guarantees that the stable fixed point is the unique global minimum of a so-called $A$-function. We prove that a suitable modification of Michel's theorem survives for line defect theories, with fixed points locally rather than globally minimizing an $A$-function along a specified surface in coupling space and provide a novel classification of the fixed points in the hypertetrahedral line defect model. For surface defects Michel's theorem survives almost untouched, and we explore bulk models for which the symmetry preserving defect is the unique stable point. In the case of interface theories, we prove that for any critical bulk model there can exist no fixed points stable under generic deformations for $N\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who first observed the phenomenon, has intrigued scientists for decades by showing that hot liquid can freeze faster than cold under certain conditions. Recently, analogous effects have been identified in integrable quantum systems. However, a key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--SYK systems coupled to SYK thermal baths, SYK systems coupled to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--the effect of temperature crossings which are absent in quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. These effects are not observed in the Liouvillian formalism. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>
