      <title>Population size in stochastic discrete-time ecological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how environmental stochasticity influences the long-term population size in certain one- and two-species models. The difficulty is that even when one can prove that there is persistence, it is usually impossible to say anything about the invariant probability measure which describes the persistent species. We are able to circumvent this problem for some important ecological models by noticing that the per-capita growth rates at stationarity are zero, something which can sometimes yield information about the invariant probability measure. For more complicated models we use a recent result by Cuello to explore how small noise influences the population size. We are able to show that environmental fluctuations can decrease, increase, or leave unchanged the expected population size. The results change according to the dynamical model and, within a fixed model, also according to which parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, etc) are affected by environmental fluctuations. Moreover, we show that not only do things change if we introduce noise differently in a model, but it also matters what one takes as the deterministic `no-noise' baseline for comparison.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the transmission dynamics of Lawsonia intracellularis in swine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission dynamics of the common enteric pathogen Lawsonia intracellularis are not fully understood. To evaluate the transmission parameters of this pathogen, one and two conventional weaned pigs, were inoculated with a pure culture of L. intracellularis, then placed among respective groups (#1 and #2) of a sentinel cohort of pigs, 9 days later. The two experimentally exposed groups (n = 31 pigs each) and a control group (n = 5 pigs) were separately housed. Fecal shedding, seroconversion, oral fluid detection, and clinical signs were monitored throughout a 38-day exposure period following the introduction of the experimentally inoculated pigs. Transmission rates were estimated based on the number of infected pigs detected over time. Quantitative PCR first detected L. intracellularis in the two experimental groups 14 days post-exposure. By day 38, 63% of Group 1 and 86% of Group 2 sentinel pigs were infected. The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.35 (95% CI: 1.62 - 7.03), and the transmission rate was 0.096 (0.046 - 0.2). These results demonstrate that introducing a single infectious source of L. intracellularis into a group of susceptible nursery age pigs is sufficient to sustain transmission over a prolonged period, resulting in infection in the majority of pigs within a five-week period. These findings underscore the ability of L. intracellularis to persist and propagate within a group, reinforcing the importance of detection and control measures.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cholera Dynamics with Vaccination as the Control Strategy and Seasonal-forcing Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a seasonally forced cholera model that incorporates imperfect vaccination as a control strategy. The model captures the temporal dynamics of susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals, as well as the environmental pathogen concentration. A key focus is the instantaneous reproduction number, which serves as a threshold indicator for outbreak persistence or elimination. When reproduction number, the disease-free equilibrium is attainable; otherwise, endemic conditions persist. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of two critical parameters: the vaccination rate and the waning rate of immunity. Results show that increasing the vaccination rate and reducing the waning rate significantly decrease reproduction number, reinforcing the importance of sustained vaccine efficacy. Seasonal forcing amplifies the complexity of cholera dynamics, revealing the need for timely public health interventions, especially before high-transmission periods. This model demonstrates practical applicability in informing vaccination strategies, especially in resource-limited settings prone to seasonal outbreaks. It offers a flexible framework for public health planning, adaptable to other waterborne diseases. The findings suggest that integrated approaches combining vaccination, improved sanitation, and targeted education are essential to reducing cholera transmission and achieving long-term control.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Fear and Social Rewards in Prey-Predator Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators, and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dengue Vulnerability in Recife, Brazil: Socioeconomic Insights from PCA and Robust Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on approximately 90,000 confirmed dengue cases reported in Recife - a major city in northeastern Brazil - between 2015 and 2024, we conducted a neighborhood-level spatial analysis. Socioeconomic and demographic indicators from the 2022 Brazilian Census were integrated to explore factors associated with the spatial distribution of dengue incidence. To address multicollinearity and reduce dimensionality, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the explanatory variables. Using the resulting components, we built predictive models via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), robust regression, and Random Forest algorithms. The OLS model explained 60.4% of the variance in case density (cases per square kilometer), while the robust model - more resilient to outliers - accounted for 43.2%. The Random Forest model, capturing nonlinear patterns, achieved 37.3%. Despite some localized gains from nonlinearity, linear models showed greater overall stability and interpretability. Using PCA scores, we constructed a dengue risk ranking of neighborhoods and compared it to the actual 2024 distribution, achieving an 83.5% match in relative ordering. Our findings indicate that census-based socioeconomic data, when combined with dimensionality reduction and predictive modeling, can effectively estimate urban dengue risk and guide spatially targeted public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Network reciprocity turns cheap talk into a force for cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-binding communication is common in daily life and crucial for fostering cooperation, even though it has no direct payoff consequences. However, despite robust empirical evidence, its evolutionary basis remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a game-theoretic model in which individuals can signal an intention to cooperate before playing a Donation game. Strategies differ in how they respond to these signals, ranging from unconditional to conditional types, with the latter incurring a cognitive cost for deliberation. Through evolutionary analysis, we show that non-binding communication alone cannot sustain cooperation in well-mixed, anonymous populations, consistent with empirical observations. In contrast, structured populations support the emergence of cooperation, with conditional cooperators acting as catalysts that protect unconditional cooperators through context-dependent patterns of cyclic dominance. These findings offer an evolutionary explanation for how non-binding communication promotes cooperation and provide a modelling framework for exploring its effects in diverse social settings.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical and Optimal Control Model for Rabies Transmission Dynamics Among Humans and Dogs with Environmental Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deterministic model to investigate rabies transmission dynamics, incorporating environmental effects and control strategies using optimal control theory. Qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the disease-free equilibrium is stable when the effective reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_e &lt; 1$, and unstable when $\mathcal{R}_e &gt; 1$. Mesh and contour plots illustrate an inverse relationship between $\mathcal{R}_e$ and control strategies, including dog vaccination, health promotion, and post-exposure treatment. Increased intervention reduces transmission, while higher contact rates among dogs raise $\mathcal{R}_e$. Numerical simulations with optimal control confirm the effectiveness of integrated strategies. Vaccination and treatment are identified as key interventions for achieving rabies elimination within five years.</description>

      <title>Uncovering symmetric and asymmetric species associations from community and environmental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no much doubt that biotic interactions shape community assembly and ultimately the spatial co-variations between species. There is a hope that the signal of these biotic interactions can be observed and retrieved by investigating the spatial associations between species while accounting for the direct effects of the environment. By definition, biotic interactions can be both symmetric and asymmetric. Yet, most models that attempt to retrieve species associations from co-occurrence or co-abundance data internally assume symmetric relationships between species. Here, we propose and validate a machine-learning framework able to retrieve bidirectional associations by analyzing species community and environmental data.
  Our framework (1) models pairwise species associations as directed influences from a source to a target species, parameterized with two species-specific latent embeddings: the effect of the source species on the community, and the response of the target species to the community; and (2) jointly fits these associations within a multi-species conditional generative model with different modes of interactions between environmental drivers and biotic associations. Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the ability of our framework to recover known asymmetric and symmetric associations and highlight the properties of the learned association networks. By comparing our approach to other existing models such as joint species distribution models and probabilistic graphical models, we show its superior capacity at retrieving symmetric and asymmetric interactions. The framework is intuitive, modular and broadly applicable across various taxonomic groups.</description>

      <title>Meta-autoencoders: An approach to discovery and representation of relationships between dynamically evolving classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that, using self-supervised training, learns a succinct parameterized representation, and a corresponding encoding and decoding process, for all instances in a given class. Here, we introduce the concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of autoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the values of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the family is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated encoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general concept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the defining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are dynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim report we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the motivating research directions in machine learning and biology.</description>

      <title>Continental scale habitat modelling with artificial intelligence and multimodal earth observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these ecosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate, high-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and restoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that complicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat classification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3 EUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical nature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially in fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation models, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance. Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted accuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance temporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with higher-quality in-situ observations.</description>

      <title>Epidemic spread: limiting contacts to regular circles is not necessarily the safest option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a new infectious disease (or a new strain of an existing one) emerges, as in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, different types of mobility restrictions are considered to slow down or mitigate the spread of the disease. The measures to be adopted require carefully weighing the social cost against their impact on disease control. In this work, we analyze, in a context of mobility restrictions, the role of frequent versus occasional contacts in epidemic spread. We develop an individual-based mathematical model where frequent contacts among individuals (at home, work, schools) and occasional contacts (at stores, transport, etc.) are considered. We define several contact structures by changing the relative weight between frequent and occasional contacts while keeping the same initial effective rate of spread. We find the remarkable result that the more frequent contacts prevail over occasional ones, the higher the epidemic peak, the sooner it occurs, and the greater the final number of individuals affected by the epidemic. We conduct our study using an SIR model, considering both exponential and deterministic recovery from infection, and obtain that this effect is more pronounced under deterministic recovery. We find that the impact of relaxation measures depends on the relative importance of frequent and occasional contacts within the considered social structures. Finally, we assess in which of the considered scenarios the homogeneous mixing approximation provides a reasonable description of the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.</description>
