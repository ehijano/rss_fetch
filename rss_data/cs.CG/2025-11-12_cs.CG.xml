      <title>Euclidean k-center Fair Clusterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many approximation algorithms and heuristic algorithms to find a fair clustering have emerged. In this paper we define a new and natural variant of fair clustering problem and design a polynomial time algorithm to compute an optimal fair clustering. Let P be a set of n points on a plane, and each point has a color in C, corresponding to a group. For each color q in C, a lower bound l(q) and an upper bound u(q) are given. Then we define the fair clustering problem as follows. The fair k-clustering problem is to find a partition of P into a set of k clusters with a minimum cost such that each cluster contains at least l(q) and at most u(q) points in P with color q. By l(q) and u(q) each cluster cannot contain too few or too many points with a specific color. If we regard a color to a gender or a minority ethnic group, the clustering corresponds to a fair clustering.</description>

      <title>Clean up your Mesh! Part 1: Plane and simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the geometric foundations of mesh representation through the lens of Plane-based Geometric Algebra (PGA), questioning its efficiency and expressiveness for discrete geometry. We find how $k$-simplices (vertices, edges, faces, ...) and $k$-complexes (point clouds, line complexes, meshes, ...) can be written compactly as joins of vertices and their sums, respectively. We show how a single formula for their $k$-magnitudes (amount, length, area, ...) follows naturally from PGA's Euclidean and Ideal norms. This idea is then extended to produce unified coordinate-free formulas for classical results such as volume, centre of mass, and moments of inertia for simplices and complexes of arbitrary dimensionality. Finally we demonstrate the practical use of these ideas on some real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Line Densification for Creating Contiguous Cartograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartograms depict geographic regions with areas proportional to quantitative data. However, when created using density-equalizing map projections, cartograms may exhibit invalid topologies if boundary polygons are drawn using only a finite set of vertices connected by straight lines. Here we introduce a method for topology-preserving line densification that guarantees that cartogram regions remain connected and non-overlapping when using density-equalizing map projections. By combining our densification technique with a flow-based cartogram generator, we present a robust framework for strictly topology-preserving cartogram construction. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces cartograms with greater accuracy and speed than alternative methods while maintaining comparable shape fidelity.</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Infinite Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pointwise free and finitely-generated persistence modules over a principal ideal domain, indexed by a (possibly infinite) totally-ordered poset category. We show that such persistence modules admit interval decompositions if and only if every structure map has free cokernel. We also show that, in torsion-free settings, the integer persistent homology module of a filtration of topological spaces admits an interval decomposition if and only if the associated persistence diagram is invariant to the choice of coefficient field. These results generalize prior work where the indexing category is finite.</description>
