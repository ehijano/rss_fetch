      <title>Accelerated structure-stability energy-free calculator</title>

Abstract: Computational modeling is an integral part of catalysis research. With it, new methodologies are being developed and implemented to improve the accuracy of simulations while reducing the computational cost. In particular, specific machine-learning techniques have been applied to build interatomic potential from ab initio results. Here, We report an energy-free machine-learning calculator that combines three individually trained neural networks to predict the energy and atomic forces of particulate matter. Three structures were investigated: a monometallic nanoparticle, a bimetallic nanoalloy, and a supported metal crystallites. Atomic energies were predicted via a graph neural network, leading to a mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.004 eV from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The task of predicting atomic forces was split over two feedforward networks, one predicting the force's norm and another its direction. The force prediction resulted in a MAE within 0.080 eV/A against DFT results. The interpretability of the graph neural network predictions was demonstrated by underlying the physics of the monometallic particle in the form of cohesion energy.</description>

      <title>Effect of Rabi dynamics in resonant x-ray scattering of intense attosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the effects of Rabi oscillations on resonant x-ray scattering in Ne$^+$ using intense attosecond and few-femtosecond pulses. The total photon yield strongly depends on the pulse area and has an upper bound at high intensities. Resonant scattering yields with attosecond pulses can be an order of magnitude higher than those far from resonances. Interference between resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels depends on the pulse area and initial state. Our results suggest that resonant x-ray scattering can be exploited for high-resolution, site-specific imaging.</description>

      <title>Interplay of protection and damage through intermolecular processes in the decay of electronic core holes in microsolvated organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft X-ray irradiation of molecules causes electronic core-level vacancies through photoelectronemission. In light elements, such as C, N, or O, which are abundant in the biosphere, these vacancies predominantly decay by Auger emission, leading inevitably to dissociative multiply charged states. It was recently demonstrated that an environment can prevent fragmentation of core-level-ionized small organic molecules through immediate non-local decay of the core hole, dissipating charge and energy to the environment. Here, we present an extended photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence (PEPIPICO) study of the biorelevant pyrimidine molecule embedded in a water cluster. It is observed and supported by theoretical calculations that the supposed protective effect of the environment is partially reversed if the vacancy is originally located at a water molecule. In this scenario, intermolecular energy or charge transfer from the core-ionized water environment to the pyrimidine molecule leads to ionization of the latter, however, presumably in non-dissociative cationic states. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay of protective and harmful effects of an environment in the photochemistry of microsolvated molecules exposed to X-rays.</description>

      <title>Theory of resonant x-ray scattering with ultrafast intense pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) approach within a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework to investigate resonant x-ray scattering under intense x-ray pulses. This method enables us to explore how coherent x-ray electron dynamics affect scattering signals from Ne$^+$. We account for both resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels, while also considering competing photoionization and inner-shell decay processes. By computing the angular distribution and energy spectrum of scattered photons, we uncover the interference effects between elastic scattering and resonant fluorescence pathways. Notably, our results reveal a small asymmetry in the energy spectrum as a result of this interference. We discuss the experimental potential for detecting signatures of interference. Our findings demonstrate that the x-ray Rabi dynamics can be used to control scattering responses and offer new insights into interference mechanisms and scattering efficiency in high-intensity x-ray regimes.</description>
