      <title>Unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods and their twists: Relative trace formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we formulated a global conjecture for the automorphic period integral associated to the symmetric pairs defined by unitary groups over number fields, generalizing a theorem of Waldspurger's toric period for $\mathrm{GL}(2)$. In this paper, we introduce a new relative trace formula to prove our global conjecture under some local hypotheses. A new feature is the presence of the relative endoscopy in the comparison. We also establish several local results on relative characters.</description>

      <title>The image of the generalized Dedekind sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newform Dedekind sum $S_{\chi_1, \chi_2}$ associated to a pair of primitive Dirichlet characters $\chi_1$, $\chi_2$ of respective conductors $q_1$, $q_2$, is a group homomorphism from $\Gamma_1(q_1 q_2)$ into the number field $F_{\chi_1, \chi_2}$ generated by the values of the characters. It is a basic question to identify the image of this map, which is known to be a lattice $L_{\chi_1, \chi_2}$ in $F_{\chi_1, \chi_2}$. It has recently been conjectured that when $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ are quadratic, then $ L_{\chi_1, \chi_2} = 2 \mathbb{Z}$.
  In this paper, we make some progress towards this conjecture by exhibiting an explicit lattice in which $L_{\chi_1, \chi_2}$ is contained; in particular, when the characters are quadratic, the $q_i$ are coprime, odd, and sufficiently large, then $L_{\chi_1, \chi_2} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>A classification of $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times_{\mathrm{tors}}$ to $\mathbb R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2009 article of Allcock and Vaaler explored the $\mathbb Q$-vector space $\mathcal G := \overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/{\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times_{\mathrm{tors}}}$, showing how to represent it as part of a function space on the places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. We establish a representation theorem for the $\mathbb R$-vector space of $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb R$, enabling us to classify extensions to $\mathcal G$ of completely additive arithmetic functions. We further outline a strategy to construct $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb Q$, i.e., elements of the algebraic dual of $\mathcal G$. Our results make heavy use of Dirichlet's $S$-unit Theorem as well as a measure-like object called a consistent map, first introduced by the author in previous work.</description>

      <title>On some periodic continued fractions along the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Brock, Elkies and Jordan generalized the theory of periodic continued fractions (PCFs) over $\mathbb{Z}$ to the ring of integers in a number field. In particular, they considered the case where the number field is an intermediate field of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ and asked whether a $(N, \ell)$-type PCF for $X_n = 2\cos(2\pi/2^{n+2})$ exists. In this paper, we construct $(1,2)$ and $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$ and give a partial answer to the question posed by Brock, Elkies, and Jordan. To obtain such results, for each type, we construct a bijection between a subset of units in each layer of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension and the set of PCFs for $X_n$. Moreover, we give a necessary condition for units corresponding to $(1,2)$ or $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$.</description>

      <title>Kolyvagin's conjecture for modular forms at non-ordinary primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove a version of Kolyvagin's conjecture for modular forms at non-ordinary primes. In particular, we generalize the work of Wang on a converse to a higher weight Gross-Zagier-Kolyvagin theorem in order to prove the conjecture under the hypothesis that some Selmer group has rank one. The main ingredients that we use in non-ordinary setting are the signed Selmer groups introduced by Lei, Loeffler and Zerbes. We will also use a result of Wan, i.e., the $p$-part of the Tamagawa number conjecture for non-ordinary modular forms with analytic rank zero. Starting from the rank one case we will show how to prove the full version of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>On 2-color partitions where one of the color is multiples of $5^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the arithmetic properties of $p_{1,5^k}(n)$, which counts 2-color partitions of $n$ where one of the colors appears only in parts that are multiples of $5^k$. By constructing generating functions for $p_{1,5^k}(n)$ across specific arithmetic progressions, we establish a set of Ramanujan-type infinite family of congruences modulo powers of $5$.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=&lt;w,x&gt;$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <title>On an analogue of the doubling method in coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theories of automorphic forms and self-dual linear codes share many remarkable analogies. In both worlds there are functions invariant under an action of a group, notions of cusp forms and Hecke operators, also projections and lifts between different geni. It is then natural to ask if other important automorphic objects or techniques could be introduced into coding theory. In this article we propose a way to introduce the doubling method, an efficient technique used to construct and study $L$-functions. As a result, we prove the so-called doubling identity, which usually forms a base of many applications. Here we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". Namely, we express a cusp form as an explicit linear combination of complete weight enumerators of the same type.</description>

      <title>Effective Mordell for curves with enough automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a completely explicit and effective upper bound for the N\'eron--Tate height of rational points of curves of genus at least $2$ over number fields, provided that they have enough automorphisms with respect to the Mordell--Weil rank of their jacobian. Our arguments build on Arakelov theory for arithmetic surfaces. Our bounds are practical, and we illustrate this by explicitly computing the rational points of a certain genus $2$ curve whose jacobian has Mordell--Weil rank $2$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative chaos measure for multiplicative functions: the $L^1$-regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
  Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</description>

      <title>Zeta function and entropy for non-archimedean subhyperbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field equipped with a discrete valuation. We establish the rationality of the Artin-Mazur zeta function on the Julia set for any subhyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with a compact Julia set. Furthermore, we conclude that the topological entropy on the Julia set of such a map is given by the logarithm of a weak Perron number. Conversely, we construct a (sub)hyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with compact Julia set whose topological entropy on the Julia set equals the logarithm of a given weak Perron number. This extends Thurston's work on the entropy for postcritically finite interval self-maps to the non-Archimedean setting.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive Spivey's type recurrence relations for the Lah-Bell polynomials and the r-Lah-Bell polynomials by utilizing operators X and D satisfying the commutation relation DX-XD=1.
  Here X is the `multiplication by x' operator and D is the differentiation operator D=d/dx. In addition, we obtain Spivey's type recurrence relation for the lambda analogue of r-Lah-Bell polynomials by some other method without using the operators X and D.</description>

      <title>Diophantine equations with sum of cubes and cube of sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve Diophantine equations of the type $ a \, (x^3 \!+ \! y^3 \!+ \! z^3 ) = (x \! + \! y \! + \! z)^3$, where $x,y,z$ are integer variables, and the coefficient $a\neq 0$ is rational. We show that there are infinite families of such equations, including those where $a$ is any cube or certain rational fractions, that have nontrivial solutions. There are also infinite families of equations that do not have any nontrivial solution, including those where $1/a = 1- 24/m$ with restrictions on the integer $m$. The equations can be represented by elliptic curves unless $a = 9$ or 1, and any elliptic curve of nonzero $j$-invariant and torsion group $\mathbb{Z}/3k\mathbb{Z}$ for $k = 2,3,4$, or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} $ corresponds to a particular $a$. We prove that for any $a$ the number of nontrivial solutions is at most 3 or is infinite, and for integer $a$ it is either 0 or $\infty$. For $a = 9$, we find the general solution, which depends on two integer parameters. These cubic equations are important in particle physics, because they determine the fermion charges under the $U(1)$ gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive product and series representations of the gamma function using Newton interpolation series. Using these identities, a new formula for the coefficients in the Taylor series of the reciprocal gamma function is found. We also find two new series representations for the Euler-Mascheroni constant, containing only rational terms. After that, we introduce a new pseudogamma function which we call the $\Lambda$ function. This function interpolates the factorial at the positive integers, the reciprocal factorial at the negative integers, and is convergent for the entire real axis. Finally, we conjecture a novel series representation for the principal branch of the inverse gamma function $\text{inv}\Gamma_0(z)$.</description>

In this case it is the Fourier transform of another measure $$\mathcal{F}\Bigl(\sum_{\gamma}\delta_{\gamma/2\pi}-2\vartheta'(2\pi t)\,dt\Bigr)=\mu.$$ We propose a definition of Fourier quasi-crystal to make sense of Dyson suggestion.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Diophantine approximation to points on the Veronese curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of simultaneously $q^{-\lambda}$-well approximable points on the Veronese curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $\lambda$ between $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{2}{2n-1}$. For $n=3$, the same result is given for a wider range of $\lambda$ between $\frac13$ and $\frac12$. We also provide a nontrivial upper bound for this Hausdorff dimension in the case $\lambda\le \frac{2}{n}$. In the course of the proof we establish that the number of cubic polynomials of height at most $H$ and non-zero discriminant at most $D$ is bounded from above by $c(\epsilon) H^{2/3 + \epsilon} D^{5/6}$.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan's continued fractions of order $10$ as modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the modularity of the continued fractions $I(\tau), J(\tau), T_1(\tau), T_2(\tau)$ and $U(\tau)=I(\tau)/J(\tau)$ of order $10$, where $I(\tau)$ and $J(\tau)$ are introduced by Rajkhowa and Saikia, which are special cases of certain identities of Ramanujan. In particular, we show that these fractions can be expressed in terms of an $\eta$-quotient $g(\tau)$ that generates the field of all modular functions on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_0(10)$. Consequently, we prove that modular equations for $g(\tau)$ and $U(\tau)$ exist at any level and derive these equations of prime levels $p\leq 11$. We also show that the continued fractions of order $10$ can be explicitly evaluated using a singular value of $g(\tau)$, which under certain conditions, generates the Hilbert class field of an imaginary quadratic field. We employ the methods of Lee and Park to establish our results.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences arising from Ramanujan-Sato Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the authors with Lea Beneish established a recipe for constructing Ramanujan-Sato series for $1/\pi$, and used this to construct 11 explicit examples of Ramanujan-Sato series arising from modular forms for arithmetic triangle groups of non-compact type. Here, we use work of Chisholm, Deines, Long, Nebe and the third author to prove a general $p$-adic supercongruence theorem through an explicit connection to CM hypergeometric elliptic curves that provides $p$-adic analogues of these Ramanujan-Sato series. We further use this theorem to construct explicit examples related to each of our explicit Ramanujan-Sato series examples.</description>

      <title>Is there a group structure on the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a global field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K be a global field, that is, a number field or a global function field. It is known that the answer to the question in the title over K is "Yes" when K has no real embeddings. We show that otherwise the answer is "No". Namely, we show that when K is a number field admitting a real embedding, it is impossible to define a group structure on the first Galois cohomology sets H^1(K,G) for all reductive K-groups G in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Primitive Divisors of Lucas Sequences in Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that all terms $U_n$ of a classical regular Lucas sequence have a primitive prime divisor if $n&gt;30$. In addition, a complete description of all regular Lucas sequences and their terms $U_n$, $2\leq n\leq 30$, which do not have a primitive divisor is also known. Here, we prove comparable results for Lucas sequences in polynomial rings, correcting some previous theorem on the same subject. The first part of our paper develops some elements of Lucas theory in several abstract settings before proving our main theorem in polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>Distribution of hooks in self-conjugate partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>
