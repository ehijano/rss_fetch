      <title>Lower Bounds for Linear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a static data structure problem of computing a linear operator under cell-probe model. Given a linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times n}$, the goal is to pre-process a vector $X \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ into a data structure of size $s$ to answer any query $\langle M_i , X \rangle$ in time $t$. We prove that for a random operator $M$, any such data structure requires:
  $$ t \geq \Omega ( \min \{ \log (m/s) , n / \log s \} ).$$ This result overcomes the well-known logarithmic barrier in static data structures [MNSW98, Sie04, PD06, PTW08, Pat11, DGW19] by using a random linear operator. Furthermore, it provides the first significant progress toward confirming a decades-old folklore conjecture: that non-linear pre-processing does not substantially help in computing most linear operators.
  A straightforward modification of our proof also yields a wire lower bound of $\Omega(n \cdot \log^{1/d}(n))$ for depth-$d$ circuits with arbitrary gates that compute a specific linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{O(n) \times n}$, even against some small constant advantage over random guessing. This bound holds even for circuits with only a small constant advantage over random guessing, improving upon longstanding results [RS03, Che08a, Che08b, GHK+13] for a random operator.
  Finally, our work partially resolves the communication form of the Multiphase Conjecture [Pat10] and makes progress on Jukna-Schnitger's Conjecture [JS11, Juk12]. We address the former by considering the Inner Product (mod 2) problem (instead of Set Disjointness) when the number of queries $m$ is super-polynomial (e.g., $2^{n^{1/3}}$), and the total update time is $m^{0.99}$. Our result for the latter also applies to cases with super-polynomial $m$.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds for Approximating Monomials via Optimal Quantum Tsallis Entropy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reveals a conceptually new connection from information theory to approximation theory via quantum algorithms for entropy estimation. Specifically, we provide an information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the approximate degree of the monomial $x^n$, compared to the analytic lower bounds shown in Newman and Rivlin (Aequ. Math. 1976) via Fourier analysis and in Sachdeva and Vishnoi (Found. Trends Theor. Comput. Sci. 2014) via the Markov brothers' inequality. This is done by relating the polynomial approximation of monomials to quantum Tsallis entropy estimation. This further implies a quantum algorithm that estimates to within additive error $\varepsilon$ the Tsallis entropy of integer order $q \geq 2$ of an unknown probability distribution $p$ or an unknown quantum state $\rho$, using $\widetilde \Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{q}\varepsilon})$ queries to the quantum oracle that produces a sample from $p$ or prepares a copy of $\rho$, improving the prior best $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ via the Shift test due to Ekert, Alves, Oi, Horodecki, Horodecki and Kwek (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum entropy estimator with optimal query complexity (up to polylogarithmic factors) for all parameters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>On the local consequence of modal Product logic: standard completeness and decidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study modal extensions of product fuzzy logic in two settings: (i) Kripke models where the accessibility relation itself takes fuzzy values, and (ii) Kripke models with a classical (crisp) accessibility relation. In both cases, the models can be evaluated either over all product algebras or over a single product algebra. In this paper, we focus on the local consequence relation for these four types of modal product logics. We show that reasoning in these modal logics can be reduced to reasoning in propositional product logic. This reduction leads to two main results. First, these logics are standard complete: the corresponding logic defined using all product algebras coincides with the one defined using only the standard product algebra on the interval [0, 1]. Second, we show that these logics are decidable.</description>

      <title>Clifford Strategies in Interactive Protocols are Classically Simulatable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\text{MIP}^\ast$ is the class of languages decidable by an efficient classical verifier interacting with multiple quantum provers that share entangled qubits but cannot communicate. Notably, $\text{MIP}^\ast$ was proved to equal $\text{RE}$, the class of all recursively enumerable languages.
  We introduce the complexity class $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$, which restricts quantum provers to Clifford operations and classical post-processing of measurement results, while still allowing shared entangled qubits in any quantum state. We show that any strategy in this model can be simulated by classical provers with shared random bits, and therefore admits a local hidden-variable description. Consequently, $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast = \text{MIP}$, a vastly smaller complexity class compared to $\text{RE}$.
  Moreover, we resolve an open question posed by Kalai et al. (STOC 2023), by showing that quantum advantage in any single-round non-local game requires at least two provers operating outside the $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$ computational model. This rules out a proposed approach for significantly improving the efficiency of quantum advantage tests that are based on compiling non-local games into single-prover interactive protocols.</description>

      <title>Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in exponential time on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{EXP}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.</description>
