      <title>ContactNet: Geometric-Based Deep Learning Model for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches achieved significant progress in predicting protein structures. These methods are often applied to protein-protein interactions (PPIs) yet require Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) which is unavailable for various interactions, such as antibody-antigen. Computational docking methods are capable of sampling accurate complex models, but also produce thousands of invalid configurations. The design of scoring functions for identifying accurate models is a long-standing challenge. We develop a novel attention-based Graph Neural Network (GNN), ContactNet, for classifying PPI models obtained from docking algorithms into accurate and incorrect ones. When trained on docked antigen and modeled antibody structures, ContactNet doubles the accuracy of current state-of-the-art scoring functions, achieving accurate models among its Top-10 at 43% of the test cases. When applied to unbound antibodies, its Top-10 accuracy increases to 65%. This performance is achieved without MSA and the approach is applicable to other types of interactions, such as host-pathogens or general PPIs.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Generative AI for de novo Drug Design: New Frontiers in Molecule and Protein Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods can vastly improve the historically costly drug design process, with various generative models already in widespread use. Generative models for de novo drug design, in particular, focus on the creation of novel biological compounds entirely from scratch, representing a promising future direction. Rapid development in the field, combined with the inherent complexity of the drug design process, creates a difficult landscape for new researchers to enter. In this survey, we organize de novo drug design into two overarching themes: small molecule and protein generation. Within each theme, we identify a variety of subtasks and applications, highlighting important datasets, benchmarks, and model architectures and comparing the performance of top models. We take a broad approach to AI-driven drug design, allowing for both micro-level comparisons of various methods within each subtask and macro-level observations across different fields. We discuss parallel challenges and approaches between the two applications and highlight future directions for AI-driven de novo drug design as a whole. An organized repository of all covered sources is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/GenAI4Drug.</description>

      <title>Antigen-Specific Antibody Design via Direct Energy-based Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibody design, a crucial task with significant implications across various disciplines such as therapeutics and biology, presents considerable challenges due to its intricate nature. In this paper, we tackle antigen-specific antibody sequence-structure co-design as an optimization problem towards specific preferences, considering both rationality and functionality. Leveraging a pre-trained conditional diffusion model that jointly models sequences and structures of antibodies with equivariant neural networks, we propose direct energy-based preference optimization to guide the generation of antibodies with both rational structures and considerable binding affinities to given antigens. Our method involves fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model using a residue-level decomposed energy preference. Additionally, we employ gradient surgery to address conflicts between various types of energy, such as attraction and repulsion. Experiments on RAbD benchmark show that our approach effectively optimizes the energy of generated antibodies and achieves state-of-the-art performance in designing high-quality antibodies with low total energy and high binding affinity simultaneously, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Are Protein Language Models Compute Optimal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While protein language models (pLMs) have transformed biological research, the scaling laws governing their improvement remain underexplored. By adapting methodologies from NLP scaling laws, we investigated the optimal ratio between model parameters and training tokens within a fixed compute budget. Our study reveals that pLM sizes scale sublinearly with compute budget, showing diminishing returns in performance as model size increases, and we identify a performance plateau in training loss comparable to the one found in relevant works in the field. Our findings suggest that widely-used pLMs might not be compute-optimal, indicating that larger models could achieve convergence more efficiently. Training a 35M model on a reduced token set, we attained perplexity results comparable to larger models like ESM-2 (15B) and xTrimoPGLM (100B) with a single dataset pass. This work paves the way towards more compute-efficient pLMs, democratizing their training and practical application in computational biology.</description>
