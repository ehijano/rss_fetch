      <title>Electronic Strong Coupling of Gas-Phase Molecular Iodine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons, hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of molecular transitions and discrete photonic modes, are a compelling platform for optical control of chemical reactivity. Despite the origins of the field of polaritonics in atomic gases, strong coupling of molecular gases remains underexplored. The pristine, solvent-free gas-phase environment may prove ideal for gaining mechanistic understanding of molecular behavior under strong light-matter coupling. In this work, we achieve electronic strong coupling of the B-X, $\nu_1$ = 0$\rightarrow$32, J = 53$\rightarrow$52 and B-X, $\nu_1$ = 0$\rightarrow$34, J = 103$\rightarrow$102 rovibronic transitions of gas-phase iodine (I$_2$) lying near 532.2 nm. We access a range of coupling strengths and detuning conditions with fine control over molecular number density and cavity length stabilization. This effort represents the first demonstration of electronic polaritons in a molecular gas and opens a new platform for polariton photochemistry and photophysics.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Spin-Orbit Interaction through Strong-Field Pumping of Inhomogeneously Aligned Molecular Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong-field interaction of a helical bi-chromatic pump with an anisotropic and inhomogeneous molecular system in the form of planar distribution of radially aligned molecular ensemble. This setting gives rise to macroscopic spin-orbit interaction where High Harmonic radiation is emitted while imbued with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) whose sign is directly dictated by the helicity of the pump field. We demonstrate this phenomenon in ensembles of $H_2^+$ and $N_2$ molecules with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) simulations.</description>

      <title>Multilevel DFT Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general computational protocol for the evaluation of extensive molecular response properties in complex environments within a polarizable quantum embedding framework. The approach extends multilevel density functional theory (MLDFT) to response theory by formulating the coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham (CPKS) equations for the MLDFT Hamiltonian. The method is further coupled to an additional polarizable molecular mechanics layer based on the fluctuating-charge (FQ) force field, which allows an accurate yet computationally efficient description of long-range interactions. We apply this new protocol to compute static and frequency-dependent linear polarizabilities and first hyperpolarizabilities of para-nitroaniline (PNA) in 1,4-dioxane and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) in aqueous solution. The framework enables physicochemical insight into solute-solvent interactions by disentangling the competing roles of electrostatics, mutual polarization, and quantum confinement (Pauli repulsion). The results match available experiments, demonstrating the reliability and robustness of the proposed approach and providing a viable route for response properties within quantum embedding methods.</description>

      <title>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Ring Coupled Cluster and the Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the ground-state correlation energy from the particle-hole channel of the random phase approximation (RPA) is formally equivalent to that from a simplified coupled cluster doubles (CCD) model that includes only ring diagram contraction contributions in the residual equations [{\em J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 129}, 231101 (2008)]. We generalize this analytic result to the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) case and demonstrate the numerical equivalence of QED-RPA and a QED ring-CCD model that accounts for double electron excitations, coupled single electron excitations / single photon creation, and double photon creation.</description>

      <title>Theory for enzymatic degradation of semi-crystalline polymer particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.</description>

      <title>Charge Exchange Dynamics in Cold Collisions of $^{40}$CaH$^+$ and $^{39}$K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of charge-exchange collisions between trapped calcium monohydride molecular ions ($^{40}$CaH$^+$) and ultracold potassium atoms ($^{39}$K) in a hybrid ion-atom trap. The measured charge-exchange rate coefficient is significantly suppressed relative to the Langevin rate constant for the system. We use quantum-chemical calculations to model the (CaH-K)$^+$ system in the ground and excited electronic states and to identify possible charge-exchange mechanisms. Our calculations do not fully explain the measured rate, highlighting the need for a full-dimensional quantum treatment that includes vibrational motion and intermediate complex formation. Our work demonstrates that cold hybrid ion-atom platforms with molecular ions enable access to richer chemical complexity and collisional dynamics inaccessible in purely atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Background-free Tracking of Ultrafast Hole and Electron Dynamics with XUV Transient Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) and transient reflectivity (TR) spectroscopies enable element-specific insights into attosecond-timescale processes in solids. XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, \~n, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of \~n, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Organic Acid Chemistry in ISM: Detection of Formic Acid and its Prebiotic Chemistry in Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moir\'e materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.</description>

      <title>Universal Foundations of Thermodynamics: Entropy and Energy Beyond Equilibrium and Without Extensivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Foundation Models from Classical Molecular Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate data-driven prediction of molecular properties is pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad chemical domains. Deep learning methods have recently garnered much attention, despite their inability to outperform classical machine learning methods when tested on practical, real-world benchmarks with limited training data. This study seeks to bridge this gap with CheMeleon, a O(10M) parameter foundation model that enables directed message-passing neural networks to finally exceed the performance of classical methods. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 75% on Polaris tasks, outperforming baselines like Random Forest (68%), fastprop (36%), and Chemprop (32%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (50%) and other foundation models. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that rely on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical simulations, CheMeleon utilizes low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich and highly transferable molecular representations, suggesting a new avenue for foundation model pre-training.</description>

      <title>v-Representability on a one-dimensional torus at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a previous result [Sutter et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 475202 (2024)] to give an explicit form of the set of $v$-representable densities on the one-dimensional torus with any fixed number of particles in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. The particle interaction has to satisfy some mild assumptions but is kept entirely general otherwise. For densities, we consider the Sobolev space $H^1$ and exploit the convexity of the functionals. This leads to a broader set of potentials than the usual $L^p$ spaces and encompasses distributions. By including temperature and thus considering all excited states in the Gibbs ensemble, G\^ateaux differentiability of the thermal universal functional is guaranteed. This yields $v$-representability and it is demonstrated that the given set of $v$-representable densities is even maximal.</description>
