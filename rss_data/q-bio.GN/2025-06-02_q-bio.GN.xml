      <title>GeneBreaker: Jailbreak Attacks against DNA Language Models with Pathogenicity Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA, encoding genetic instructions for almost all living organisms, fuels groundbreaking advances in genomics and synthetic biology. Recently, DNA Foundation Models have achieved success in designing synthetic functional DNA sequences, even whole genomes, but their susceptibility to jailbreaking remains underexplored, leading to potential concern of generating harmful sequences such as pathogens or toxin-producing genes. In this paper, we introduce GeneBreaker, the first framework to systematically evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities of DNA foundation models. GeneBreaker employs (1) an LLM agent with customized bioinformatic tools to design high-homology, non-pathogenic jailbreaking prompts, (2) beam search guided by PathoLM and log-probability heuristics to steer generation toward pathogen-like sequences, and (3) a BLAST-based evaluation pipeline against a curated Human Pathogen Database (JailbreakDNABench) to detect successful jailbreaks. Evaluated on our JailbreakDNABench, GeneBreaker successfully jailbreaks the latest Evo series models across 6 viral categories consistently (up to 60\% Attack Success Rate for Evo2-40B). Further case studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HIV-1 envelope protein demonstrate the sequence and structural fidelity of jailbreak output, while evolutionary modeling of SARS-CoV-2 underscores biosecurity risks. Our findings also reveal that scaling DNA foundation models amplifies dual-use risks, motivating enhanced safety alignment and tracing mechanisms.

      <title>Refining Platelet Purification Methods: Enhancing Proteomics for Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Platelet proteomics offers valuable insights for clinical research, yet isolating high-purity platelets remains a challenge. Current methods often lead to contamination or platelet loss, compromising data quality and reproducibility.
  Objectives: This study aimed to optimize a platelet isolation technique that yields high-purity samples with minimal loss and to identify the most effective mass spectrometry-based proteomic method for analyzing platelet proteins with optimal coverage and sensitivity.
  Methods: We refined an isolation protocol by adjusting centrifugation time to reduce blood volume requirements while preserving platelet yield and purity. Using this optimized method, we evaluated three proteomic approaches: Label-free Quantification with Data-Independent Acquisition (LFQ-DIA), Label-free Quantification with Data-Dependent Acquisition (LFQ-DDA), and Tandem Mass Tag labeling with DDA (TMT-DDA).
  Results: LFQ-DIA demonstrated superior protein coverage and sensitivity compared to LFQ-DDA and TMT-DDA. The refined isolation protocol effectively minimized contamination and platelet loss. Additionally, age-related differences in platelet protein composition were observed, highlighting the importance of using age-matched controls in biomarker discovery studies.
  Conclusions: The optimized platelet isolation protocol provides a cost-effective and reliable method for preparing high-purity samples for proteomics. LFQ-DIA is the most suitable approach for comprehensive platelet protein analysis. Age-related variation in platelet proteomes underscores the need for demographic matching in clinical proteomic research.</description>
