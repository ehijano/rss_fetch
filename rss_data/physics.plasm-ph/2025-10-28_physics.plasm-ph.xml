      <title>High-Harmonic Optical Vortex Generation from a Plasma Aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a high-power, femtosecond, circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse is incident on a micrometer-scale aperture in a solid foil target, it drives surface plasma oscillation, generating high-order harmonic vortices in the diffracted light. However, this mechanism has so far only been studied theoretically under ideal conditions. In this work, we perform numerical studies on more realistic situations. In particular, we focus on a scenario where the laser is obliquely incident on the target surface to avoid the potential damage of the optics by the reflected light. We demonstrate that increasing oblique incidence angle, reducing target thickness, and improving laser contrast can enhance the harmonic conversion efficiency. However, the generated harmonic beams may contain both Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) (vortex) and non-LG components under non-ideal conditions. We show that they can be separated by their divergence, as the vortex components has smaller diverging angle. In addition, we have performed computational analyses on the harmonic divergence angles and topological charge spectra of vortex high-order harmonics under different conditions. These high-order harmonic pure LG modes can potentially be filtered out for wide range of fundamental and applied physics researches. This study provides valuable insights for the design and implementation of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning approach to modeling of neutral particles transport in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A propagator-based approach is investigated for Monte-Carlo (MC) modeling of neutral particles transport in fusion boundary plasmas. The propagator is essentially a Green function for the neutral kinetic equation, which depends on the plasma profiles. A Neural Network (NN) based model for the propagator provides a fast and accurate solution for the neutral distribution function in plasma. Furthermore, continuous and smooth dependence of NN-based reconstruction of the propagator on the plasma parameters opens the possibility for using this approach with Jacobian-based methods for time-integration and root finding. Initial results from a small 1D test problem look promising; however, important research questions are concerned with the scaling of the algorithm to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Design of Backscatter Tailored Optical Fibers for distributed magnetic field sensing using Fiber Optic Pulsed Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber optic pulsed polarimetry is a LIDAR-like fiber sensing technique that uses a backscatter enhanced single mode backscatter-tailored optical fiber(BTOF) to measure the distributed B fields on all Magnetic Fusion Energy devices. The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg gratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant determines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement of local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized plasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber is obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B field accuracy(&lt;1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF produces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms are given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat reflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The contamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a BTOF. Applications include magnetic fusion devices, rail guns, high temperature superconducting magnets and magnetized target fusion research.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Biennial Oscillations and Rieger-type Periodicities in a Babcock-Leighton Solar Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or ``season of the Sun." Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \bl\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \bl\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \bl\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \bl\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \bl\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.</description>

      <title>Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.</description>

      <title>A DSMC-PIC coupling method for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for the simulation of collisional plasma dynamics, based on a coupling between Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system. The approach extends previously developed DSMC techniques for the homogeneous Landau equation to the fully inhomogeneous, electromagnetic regime. The Landau collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate, reverse-mode differentiable bounce-averaging algorithm and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast, spectrally accurate, automatically differentiable bounce-averaging algorithm implemented in the DESC stellarator optimization suite. Using this algorithm, we can perform efficient optimization of many objectives to improve stellarator performance, such as the $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}$ proxy for the neoclassical transport coefficient in the $1/\nu$ (banana) regime. By employing this differentiable approximation, for the first time, we optimize a finite-beta stellarator to directly reduce neoclassical ripple transport using reverse-mode differentiation. This ensures the cost of differentiation is independent of the number of controllable parameters.</description>

      <title>Global linear drift-wave eigenmode structures on flux surfaces in stellarators: ion temperature gradient mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent transport greatly impacts the performance of stellarator magnetic confinement devices. While significant progress has been made on the numerical front, theoretical understanding of turbulence in stellarators is still lacking. In particular, due to nonaxisymmetry, different field lines couple within flux surfaces, the effects from which have yet to be adequately studied. In this work, we numerically simulate the linear electrostatic ion-temperature-gradient modes in stellarators using the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC. We find that the linear eigenmode structures are nonuniform across field lines on flux surfaces and are localized at the downstream of the ion diamagnetic drift. Based on a simple model from Zocco et al. [Phys. Plasmas 23, 082516 (2016); 27, 022507 (2020)], we show that the localization can be explained from the nonzero imaginary part of the binormal wavenumber. We further demonstrate that a localized surface-global eigenmode can be constructed from local gyrokinetic codes stella and GX, only if we first solve the local dispersion relation with real wavenumbers on each field line, and then do an analytic continuation to the complex-wavenumber plane. These results suggest that the complex-wavenumber spectra from surface-global effects are required to understand the linear drift-wave eigenmode structures in stellarators.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar near-surface mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which occurs at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

      <title>Kappa distributions in the framework of superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherently Enhanced Axion-Photon Conversion via Seeded Photons for Short-Pulse Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a seeded axion-photon conversion scheme to enhance the sensitivity of light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments for axion detection, where the axions are generated from short pulse lasers and the usual resonant cavity is not applicable. By injecting a weak, coherent seed electromagnetic (EM) field into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the number of regenerated photons to a level exceeding that of the unseeded scenario. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, statistical limits from Poisson counting with seed fluctuations and background, and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach presents a promising pathway to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, particularly in scenarios where the resonant cavities are impractical.</description>
