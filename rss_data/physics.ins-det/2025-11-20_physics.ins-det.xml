      <title>A Novel Pixel-Chip-Based Region-of-Interest Readout Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pixel chip readout scheme: the Region-of-Interest Readout Circuit (ROIRC), which is designed for large area, large array pixel chips and Gas Pixel Detector (GPD). This design employs a sentinel pixel detection strategy, enabling rapid identification and prioritized readout of the pixel regions containing signal events. During the scanning readout of these signal events, ROIRC employs a Block-based readout approach, effectively minimizing the readout of non-signal pixels. The functionality of ROIRC has been successfully implemented on both the ASIC and FPGA platforms. In the tests of the ROIRC, the pixel chip embedded in the GPD is capable of detecting low-energy X-rays in the range of 2-10 keV and supports multiple event readouts, and the pixel chip can read out photo-electron signal events with the count rate up to 15k / (cm2 x s).</description>

      <title>Magnetic signal scan imaging system based on giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) differential sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a magnetic signal scanning and imaging system based on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect. The system employs a pair of performance-matched GMI sensing elements configured as a differential probe structure. Through co-optimized low-noise electronic and probe design, the system effectively suppresses both intrinsic sensor common-mode drift and external environmental magnetic noise, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio detection of nono-tesla to micro-tesla-level magnetic signals without magnetic shielding. Experimental results demonstrate that the differential system achieves significantly lower noise spectral density in unshielded environments compared to conventional GMI sensors (\SI{46}{pT}/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ versus \SI{286}{pT}/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at \SI{1}{Hz}), with a sensitivity of 186,790 V/T and spatial resolution better than 200 micrometers. The system's excellent performance in weak magnetic field detection and spatial resolution was verified through scanning experiments of magnetic ink on US banknotes and magnetic reference samples. Compared to SQUID scanning systems, which requiring liquid helium cooling, this system based on the GMI effect offers advantages of room-temperature operation, compact structure, and low cost. Relative to conventional single-element GMI microscopes, it achieves significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and environmental adaptability. This research provides a practical solution for high-resolution magnetic field imaging at room temperature with broad application potential in materials magnetism, biomagnetic imaging, and nanomagnetic detection.</description>

      <title>High Density Hybridisation Using ENIG Bumping and Anisotropic Conductive Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-pitch hybridisation processes are essential for next-generation pixel detectors and high-density microelectronic assemblies. Conventional bump-bonding techniques, although reliable, remain costly and difficult to implement for single-die applications.
  In this work, we present flip-chip hybridisation results combining Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) bumping with Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) bonding, both developed in-house. This method enables fine-pitch interconnections without requiring wafer-level processing.
  The feasibility of the ENIG-ACF process for functional devices was demonstrated by hybridising functional Timepix3 ASIC and Ti-LGAD (Trench Isolated Low-Gain Avalanche Detector) sensors with 55 um pitch. The approach was then extended to test structures with 25 um pitch, using aligned-particle ACFs. The analysis revealed that the main limitation originated from the mismatch between ACF thickness and bump height, underlining the importance of interface geometry optimisation. To address this, a dedicated simulation program was developed to model the isotropic growth of ENIG bumps and to determine the optimum bump height as a function of ACF thickness and pixel-matrix geometry.
  The results provide valuable guidelines for future high connection density assemblies and demonstrate the potential of the ENIG-ACF process as a scalable, low-cost alternative to conventional bump-bonding techniques.</description>

      <title>Detection of a highly stable orbital-period signal in GRACE-FO one-way intersatellite ranging using a synchronization-free differential observable (origin currently unidentified)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a consistent, large-amplitude signal using a new synchronization-free protocol for probing directional time-dilation asymmetries with one-way ranging data between Earth-orbiting satellites. Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.
  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.</description>

      <title>Wombat, the high intensity diffractometer in operation at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wombat is the high intensity neutron diffractometer in operation at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. While primarily used as a high-speed powder diffractometer, the high-performance area detector allows both texture characterisation and single-crystal measurements. The instrument can be configured over a large range of operational parameters, which are characterised in this contribution to aid experimental planning. Wombat is particularly optimised for the study of materials in situ and in operando using the wide range of sample environment available at the centre. Over 17 years of operation, Wombat has been used to explore a broad range of materials, including: novel hydrogen-storage materials, negative-thermal-expansion materials, cryogenic minerals, piezoelectrics, high performance battery anodes and cathodes, high strength alloys, multiferroics, superconductors and novel magnetic materials. This paper will highlight the capacity of the instrument, recent comprehensive characterisation measurements, and how the instrument has been utilised by our user community to date.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for the hybrid digital optical module of TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TRIDENT (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope) experiment is a next-generation underwater neutrino observatory planned for deployment in the West Pacific Ocean, designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation. The full-scale detector will consist of approximately 1000 vertical strings, each equipped with 20 hybrid digital optical modules (hDOMs) containing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for comprehensive light detection. This paper presents a custom-designed digitization mainboard prototype for the hDOM, featuring simultaneous 32-channel PMT waveform digitization at 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters and 56-channel high-precision time measurement through field-programmable gate array -implemented time-to-digital converters. The system demonstrates excellent performance in single photoelectron (PE) detection with clear pedestal separation, maintains linear response up to 240 PEs, and achieves sub-nanosecond timing resolution for PMT or SiPM pulse edges.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Performance of Tritium Process Monitors from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionization chamber-based, in-line tritium process monitors play an important part in determining the behavior of a tritium system. The one-liter detection volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 {\mu}Ci/m^3$ to $1 Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate additional detector geometries and designs in the future.</description>

      <title>Charge carrier generation in RNDR-DEPFET Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.
  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.</description>
