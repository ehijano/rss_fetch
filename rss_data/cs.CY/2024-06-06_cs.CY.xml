      <title>Pre-trained Transformer Uncovers Meaningful Patterns in Human Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We empirically demonstrate that a transformer pre-trained on country-scale unlabeled human mobility data learns embeddings capable, through fine-tuning, of developing a deep understanding of the target geography and its corresponding mobility patterns. Utilizing an adaptation framework, we evaluate the performance of our pre-trained embeddings in encapsulating a broad spectrum of concepts directly and indirectly related to human mobility. This includes basic notions, such as geographic location and distance, and extends to more complex constructs, such as administrative divisions and land cover. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals a substantial performance boost gained from pre-training, reaching up to 38% in tasks such as tree-cover regression. We attribute this result to the ability of the pre-training to uncover meaningful patterns hidden in the raw data, beneficial for modeling relevant high-level concepts. The pre-trained embeddings emerge as robust representations of regions and trajectories, potentially valuable for a wide range of downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Overwhelmed Software Developers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted a qualitative psychology study to explore the experience of feeling overwhelmed in the realm of software development. Through the candid confessions of two participants who have recently faced overwhelming challenges, we have identified seven distinct categories: communication-induced, disturbance-related, organizational, variety, technical, temporal, and positive overwhelm. While most types of overwhelm tend to deteriorate productivity and increase stress levels, developers sometimes perceive overwhelm as a catalyst for heightened focus, self-motivation, and productivity. Stress was often found to be a common companion of overwhelm. Our findings align with previous studies conducted in diverse disciplines. However, we believe that software developers possess unique traits that may enable them to navigate through the storm of overwhelm more effectively.</description>

      <title>Ask LLMs Directly, "What shapes your bias?": Measuring Social Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social bias is shaped by the accumulation of social perceptions towards targets across various demographic identities. To fully understand such social bias in large language models (LLMs), it is essential to consider the composite of social perceptions from diverse perspectives among identities. Previous studies have either evaluated biases in LLMs by indirectly assessing the presence of sentiments towards demographic identities in the generated text or measuring the degree of alignment with given stereotypes. These methods have limitations in directly quantifying social biases at the level of distinct perspectives among identities. In this paper, we aim to investigate how social perceptions from various viewpoints contribute to the development of social bias in LLMs. To this end, we propose a novel strategy to intuitively quantify these social perceptions and suggest metrics that can evaluate the social biases within LLMs by aggregating diverse social perceptions. The experimental results show the quantitative demonstration of the social attitude in LLMs by examining social perception. The analysis we conducted shows that our proposed metrics capture the multi-dimensional aspects of social bias, enabling a fine-grained and comprehensive investigation of bias in LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can the right requirements boost developer satisfaction and happiness? We believe they can. In keeping with this issue's theme, "Well-Being for Resilience: Developers Thrive," we discuss the connection between the three keywords, well-being, resilience, and thriving. How could requirements engineering foster these qualities? While there hasn't been much research on this topic, we see opportunities for future work. Let's initiate the discussion!</description>

      <title>Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing concerns about the AI alignment problem have emerged in recent years, with previous work focusing mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a singular unit. Recent work in sociotechnical AI alignment has made some progress in defining alignment inclusively, but the field as a whole still lacks a systematic understanding of how to specify, describe, and analyze misalignment among entities, which may include individual humans, AI agents, and complex compositional entities such as corporations, nation-states, and so forth. Previous work on controversy in computational social science offers a mathematical model of contention among populations (of humans). In this paper, we adapt this contention model to the alignment problem, and show how misalignment can vary depending on the population of agents (human or otherwise) being observed, the domain in question, and the agents' probability-weighted preferences between possible outcomes. Our model departs from value specification approaches and focuses instead on the morass of complex, interlocking, sometimes contradictory goals that agents may have in practice. We apply our model by analyzing several case studies ranging from social media moderation to autonomous vehicle behavior. By applying our model with appropriately representative value data, AI engineers can ensure that their systems learn values maximally aligned with diverse human interests.</description>

      <title>Improving Alignment and Robustness with Short Circuiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that "short-circuits" models as they respond with harmful outputs. Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, short-circuiting directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, short-circuiting allows the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Digital Neocolonialism in Global Education: Towards an Equitable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically discusses how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) might impose Western ideologies on non-Western societies, perpetuating digital neocolonialism in education through its inherent biases. It further suggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these effects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural imperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural references and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating students from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western languages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational content less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially impacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI often generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of technologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous knowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies educational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial exploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We propose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in GenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to identify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications; foresight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future educational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the retrieval of neocolonial outputs.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and triggers of misinformation on vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked renewed attention on the prevalence of misinformation online, whether intentional or not, underscoring the potential risks posed to individuals' quality of life associated with the dissemination of misconceptions and enduring myths on health-related subjects. In this study, we analyze 6 years (2016-2021) of Italian vaccine debate across diverse social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), encompassing all major news sources - both questionable and reliable. We first use the symbolic transfer entropy analysis of news production time-series to dynamically determine which category of sources, questionable or reliable, causally drives the agenda on vaccines. Then, leveraging deep learning models capable to accurately classify vaccine-related content based on the conveyed stance and discussed topic, respectively, we evaluate the focus on various topics by news sources promoting opposing views and compare the resulting user engagement. Aside from providing valuable resources for further investigation of vaccine-related misinformation, particularly in a language (Italian) that receives less attention in scientific research compared to languages like English, our study uncovers misinformation not as a parasite of the news ecosystem that merely opposes the perspectives offered by mainstream media, but as an autonomous force capable of even overwhelming the production of vaccine-related content from the latter. While the pervasiveness of misinformation is evident in the significantly higher engagement of questionable sources compared to reliable ones, our findings underscore the importance of consistent and thorough pro-vax coverage. This is especially crucial in addressing the most sensitive topics where the risk of misinformation spreading and potentially exacerbating negative attitudes toward vaccines among the users involved is higher.</description>

      <title>Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in "input space", "concept space", and "output space", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract "concept space" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. Our meta-research provides insights into how the nature and meaning of citation practices in HCI have changed, influenced by factors such as digital accessibility of resources and academic pressures. The observed trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the value of meta-research for research communities and the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report that ChatGPT 4 and 4o are susceptible to a prompt injection attack that allows an attacker to exfiltrate users' personal data. It is applicable without the use of any 3rd party tools and all users are currently affected. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the recent introduction of ChatGPT's memory feature, which allows an attacker to command ChatGPT to monitor the user for the desired personal data.</description>
