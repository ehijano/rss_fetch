      <title>Haldane graphene billiards versus relativistic neutrino billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuation properties in the energy spectra of finite-size honeycomb lattices, graphene billiards, subject to the Haldane-model onsite potential and next-nearest neighbor interaction at critical points, referred to as Haldane graphene billiards in the following. The billiards had the shapes of a rectangular billiard with integrable dynamics, one with chaotic dynamics, and one whose shape has, in addition, threefold rotational symmetry. It had been shown that the spectral properties of the graphene billiards coincide with those of the nonrelativistic quantum billiard with the corresponding shape, both at the band edges and in the region of low energy excitations around the Dirac points at zero energy. There, the dispersion relation is linear and, accordingly, the spectrum is described by the same relativistic Dirac equation for massless half-spin particles as relativistic neutrino billiards, whose spectral properties agree with those of nonrelativistic quantum billiards with violated time-reversal invariance. Deviations from the expected behavior are attributed to differing boundary conditions and backscattering at the boundary, which leads to a mixing of valley states corresponding to the two Dirac points, that are mapped into each other through time reversal. We employ a Haldane model to introduce a gap at one of the two Dirac points so that backscattering is suppressed in the energy region of the gap and demonstrate that there the correlations in the spectra comply with those of the neutrino billiard of the corresponding shape.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two non-identical Chialvo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synchronization between two neurons using the stochastic version of the map-based Chialvo model. To simulate non-identical neurons, a mismatch is introduced in one of the main parameters of the model. Subsequently, the synchronization of the neurons is studied as a function of this mismatch, the noise introduced in the stochastic model, and the coupling strength between the neurons. We propose the simplest neuron network for study, as its analysis is more straightforward and does not compromise generality. Within this network, two nonidentical neuron maps are electrically coupled. In order to understand if specific behaviors affect the global behavior of the system, we consider different cases related to the behavior of the neurons (chaotic or periodic). Furthermore, we study how variations in model parameters affect the firing frequency in all cases. Additionally, we consider that the two neurons have both excitatory and inhibitory couplings. Consequently, we identify critical values of noise and mismatch for achieving satisfactory synchronization between the neurons in both cases. Finally, we conjecture that the results are of a general nature and are applicable to different neuron models.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through rectangular cross-sections. For a given rectangular cross-section, this results in a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter as the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. We observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises the physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delay inputs. We show that, much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, fewer hyperparameters and increased interpretability compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, the optical NGRC framework also paves the way for next generation physical RC, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing nonlinear coupled systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in nonlinear systems.</description>
