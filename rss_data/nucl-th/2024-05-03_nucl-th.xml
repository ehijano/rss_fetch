      <title>The odd-even differences in stability peninsula for $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$ region with the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictive power of the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with density functional PC-PK1 is demonstrated for superheavy region ($101 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$) by comparing with available experimental and empirical mass data in the AME2020. The DRHBc theory predicts 93 bound nuclei beyond the drip line $N = 258$ in the region of $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$, which form a stability peninsula. The odd-even differences between odd-$N$ and even-$N$ nuclei are remarkable in the stability peninsula; the number of bound odd-$N$ nuclei is less than that of bound even-$N$ nuclei, and the one-neutron separation energy of an odd-$N$ nucleus is smaller than those of its neighboring even-$N$ nuclei due to the blocking effect. The deformation effect is indispensable for the reentrant stability beyond the drip line by significantly affecting the structure of single-particle levels around the Fermi energy. \textbf{\textcolor{red}{The interplay between deformation and pairing effects affects the position where the odd-$N$ nucleus becomes bound in the stability peninsula.}} By examining the deformation effect at different orders, it is found that \textbf{\textcolor{red}{quadrupole deformation makes leading contribution to the appearance of stability peninsula and the effects of hexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole deformations are nonnegligible.</description>

      <title>$U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking quark interactions from vacuum polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these $U_A(1)$ breaking interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks and several other - involving vector and/or axial quark currents - survive even in the absence of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking. By means of the auxiliary field method, these interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. By restricting to the up and down quark sector, some three-meson couplings correspond to the strong decay of specific light axial-vector mesons. These (strong) decays are shown to yield an asymmetry in the production rate of positive and negative pions by means of interference effects that arise due to neutral meson mixings.</description>

      <title>Particle-theory input for neutron-star physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties and physical phase of the dense strongly interacting matter present in the cores of neutron stars or created in their binary mergers remains one of the most prominent open problems in nuclear astrophysics. While most microscopic analyses have historically relied on solvable phenomenological models of nuclear and quark matter, in recent years a model-independent approach utilizing only controlled ab-initio calculations and astrophysical observations has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In these lecture notes, I review recent progress in first-principles weak-coupling calculations within high-density quark matter, shedding light on its thermodynamic and transport properties. I cover the most important technical tools used in such calculations, introduce selected highlight results, and explain how this information can be used in phenomenological studies of neutron-star physics. The notes do not offer a self-consistent treatment of the topics covered, but rather aim at filling gaps in existing textbooks on thermal field theory and at connecting the dots in a story developed in several recent research articles, to which the interested reader is directed for further technical details.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of thermal effects in dense matter within the covariant density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high temperatures reached in a proto-neutron star or during the post-merger phase of a binary neutron star coalescence lead to non-negligible thermal effects on the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Here we study these effects within the covariant density functional theory employing the posteriors of a Bayesian inference, which encompasses a large sample of EOS models. Different densities and temperatures are considered. We find that for a number of quantities thermal effects are strongly correlated with the Dirac effective mass ($m^*$) of the nucleons and/or its logarithmic derivative as a function of density. These results can be explained within the low temperature approximation though they survive beyond this limit.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential of synthesizing unknown superheavy isotopes via cold-fusion reactions based on the dinuclear system model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess the potential of cold-fusion for synthesizing superheavy nuclei (SHN) with proton numbers 104-113, we systematically calculated 145 naturally occurring projectile-target combinations within the DNS model. Reactions predominantly show maximum cross-sections in the 1n to 2n channels, peaking near the Coulomb barrier with a sum of barrier and Q-value within 30 MeV. The maximum cross-section occurs below the Bass barrier, suggesting either the Bass model's limitation or significant deformation reducing the effective Coulomb barrier. Our calculations align well with experimental data, revealing that more neutron-rich projectiles slightly enhance fusion, though the effect is minor. For fixed targets (Pb, Bi), evaporation residue cross-sections decrease linearly with increasing projectile proton number, attributed to reduced fusion probability and lower fission barriers in heavier SHN. The touching potential $V_{\rm in}$ shows a linear trend with the product of projectile-target proton numbers, with neutron-rich systems exhibiting lower $V_{\rm in}$. Some reactions with $V_{\rm in} &lt; V_{\rm S}$ may involve nucleon transfer before capture. Based on the DNS model, we identified optimal combinations and collision energies for synthesizing SHN with significant cross-sections. Collectively, our findings indicate that cold fusion is a promising avenue for creating proton-rich SHN around the drip line in the Z=104-113 region, offering distinct advantages over alternative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients $v_2(p_T,\text{cent})$ and $v_3(p_T,\text{cent})$ in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, and Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV at the LHC, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle'. These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire $p_T$ and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities ($\varepsilon_{n}$), dimensionless size ($\mathbb{R}$), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function ($\delta_f$), the medium's stopping power ($\hat{q}$), and specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>
