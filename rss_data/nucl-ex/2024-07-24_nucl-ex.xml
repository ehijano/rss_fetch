      <title>Towards the Discovery of New Elements: Production of Livermorium (Z=116) with 50Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{244}$Pu($^{50}$Ti,$xn$)$^{294-x}$Lv reaction was investigated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron facility. The experiment was aimed at the production of a superheavy element with $Z\ge 114$ by irradiating an actinide target with a beam heavier than $^{48}$Ca. Produced Lv ions were separated from the unwanted beam and nuclear reaction products using the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator and implanted into a newly commissioned focal plane detector system. Two decay chains were observed and assigned to the decay of $^{290}$Lv. The production cross section was measured to be $\sigma_{\rm prod}=0.44(^{+58}_{-28})$~pb at a center-of-target center-of-mass energy of 220(3)~MeV. This represents the first published measurement of the production of a superheavy element near the `Island-of-Stability', with a beam of $^{50}$Ti and is an essential precursor in the pursuit of searching for new elements beyond $Z=118$.</description>

      <title>Implications of the laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the low-lying Th-229 isomer transition is starting a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by Tiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al. [arXiv:2406.18719 [physics.atom-ph]] to surpass it.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of nuclear matter from collective flows and stopping in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of nuclear matter, momentum dependence of the effective interaction and in-medium modification of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections are studied by comparing theoretical predictions for stopping, directed and elliptic flows of protons and light clusters in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions of beam energy between 150 and 800 MeV/nucleon to experimental data gathered by the FOPI Collaboration. A multivariate analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties induced on model predictions by the coalescence afterburner leads to the following constraint for the equation of state at 68 percent confidence level: compressibility modulus of isospin symmetric matter $K_0=230^{+9}_{-11}$ MeV and slope of the symmetry energy $L=63^{+10}_{-13}$ MeV. The momentum dependence of the isoscalar potential is found to be similar to that of the empirical optical potential, with an effective isoscalar mass $m^*=0.695^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. The isovector potential displays a momentum dependence corresponding to a positive neutron-proton effective mass difference $\Delta m^*_{np}=(0.17^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\delta$, close to the world average for this quantity. A suppression of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation by about 60$\%$ relative to vacuum values is deduced, in qualitative agreement with microscopical results. A strong dependence of the suppression factor on isospin asymmetry is evidenced, experimental data for isospin symmetric systems proving crucial for this last conclusion.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the neutron-emission probability with a surrogate reaction in inverse kinematics at a heavy-ion storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron-induced reaction cross sections of short-lived nuclei are imperative to understand the origin of heavy elements in stellar nucleosynthesis and for societal applications, but their measurement is extremely complicated due to the radioactivity of the targets involved. One way of overcoming this issue is to combine surrogate reactions with the unique possibilities offered by heavy-ion storage rings. In this work, we describe the first surrogate-reaction experiment in inverse kinematics, which we successfully conducted at the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) of the GSI/FAIR facility, using the 208Pb(p,p') reaction as a surrogate for neutron capture on 207Pb. Thanks to the outstanding detection efficiencies possible at the ESR, we were able to measure for the first time the neutron-emission probability as a function of the excitation energy of 208Pb. We have used this probability to select different descriptions of the gamma-ray strength function and nuclear level density, and provide reliable results for the neutron-induced radiative capture cross section of 207Pb at energies for which no experimental data exist.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Hydrodynamics under Rotation: Prospects &amp; Limitations from a Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence, or holography, has provided numerous important insights into the behavior of strongly-coupled many-body systems. Crucially, it has provided a testing ground for the construction of new effective field theories, especially those in the low frequency, long wavelength limit known as hydrodynamics. We review the study of strongly-coupled rotating fluids using holography, and we examine the hydrodynamics emerging from the study of rotating Myers-Perry black holes. We discuss three regimes in which holographic rotating fluids display either (1) hydrodynamic behavior of a boosted fluid, (2) hydrodynamic behavior distinct from a boosted fluid, or (3) no obvious hydrodynamic behavior. We describe techniques to obtain hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, and we compute the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic regimes. The limitations of hydrodynamics under rotation are discussed alongside our findings.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum at Small $x$ Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the small Bjorken-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions in the proton utilizing the revised small-$x$ helicity evolution derived recently. We relate the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$ to the polarized dipole amplitudes and their (first) impact-parameter moments. To obtain the OAM distributions, we derive novel small-$x$ evolution equations for the impact-parameter moments of the polarized dipole amplitudes in the double-logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant). We solve these evolution equations numerically and extract the leading large-$N_c$, small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon OAM distributions, which we determine to be
  \begin{align}
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x, Q^2) \sim L_{G}(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma(x, Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66 \, \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}}, \notag
  \end{align} in agreement with the existing results in the literature within the precision of our numerical evaluation. (Here $N_c$ is the number of quark colors.) We also investigate the ratios of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to their helicity distribution counterparts in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Examination of the evidence for a proton halo in $^{22}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More and more halo nuclei or candidates have been identified or suggested in experiments in recent years. It was declared that the halo structure of $^{22}$Al is revealed by the large isospin asymmetry in $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O mirror Gamow-Teller transitions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 192503 (2020)]. We highlight that a significant mirror asymmetry already exists between wave functions of the likely unbound nucleus $^{22}$Si and the doubly-magic nucleus $^{22}$O, which largely explains the observed asymmetry in the transitions. Furthermore, these transitions involve only the $1^+$ excited states of the daughter nuclei $^{22}$Al and $^{22}$F. The $1^+$ state of $^{22}$Al cannot be considered a halo state due to its proton-unbound nature. An analysis of the spin-parity suggests that a weakly bound $2s_{1/2}$ valence proton in the ground state of $^{22}$Al is improbable. To investigate the shell structure for the ground state of $^{22}$Al, we employ the state-of-the-art deformed and triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theories in continuum. We find that a small $s$-wave component of $5\%$ appears for the weakly bound valence proton in $^{22}$Al only when triaxial deformation is considered. While the examination of densities and rms radii indicates that this small $s$-wave component is insufficient to form a discernible proton halo in $^{22}$Al, slightly larger $2s_{1/2}$ occupations have been reported in other recent theoretical results. The question of how many low-$\ell$ components are sufficient to form a proton halo in the presence of the Coulomb barrier remains open. Thus, future measurements of reaction or interaction cross sections and momentum distributions of breakup fragments are highly desirable to verify whether $^{22}$Al is a halo nucleus.</description>

Abstract: The Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer (CPT) has conducted precision mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides from the CAlifornia Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) of the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) facility at Argonne National Laboratory for over a decade, first using Time-Of-Flight Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (TOF-ICR) and later using Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) techniques. Here we give an overview of the CPT system as it was operated for PI-ICR measurements at CARIBU for over half a decade, along with some recently studied systematic effects.</description>
