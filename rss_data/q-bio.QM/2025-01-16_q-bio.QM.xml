      <title>Continuation methods as a tool for parameter inference in electrophysiology modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterizing mathematical models of biological systems often requires fitting to stable periodic data. In cardiac electrophysiology this typically requires converging to a stable action potential through long simulations. We explore this problem through the theory of dynamical systems, bifurcation analysis and continuation methods; under which a converged action potential is a stable limit cycle. Various attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of identifying these limit cycles, with limited success. We demonstrate that continuation methods can more efficiently infer the converged action potential as proposed model parameter sets change during optimization or inference routines. In an example electrophysiology model this reduces parameter inference computation time by 70%. We also discuss theoretical considerations and limitations of continuation method use in place of time-consuming model simulations. The application of continuation methods allows more robust optimization by making extra runs from multiple starting locations computationally tractable, and facilitates the application of inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo to gain more information on the plausible parameter space.</description>

      <title>A large population of cell-specific action potential models replicating fluorescence recordings of voltage in rabbit ventricular myocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput experiments unveil substantial electrophysiological diversity among uncoupled healthy myocytes under identical conditions. To quantify inter-cell variability, the values of a subset of the parameters in a well-regarded mathematical model of the action potential of rabbit ventricular myocytes are estimated from fluorescence voltage measurements of a large number of cells. Statistical inference yields a population of nearly 1200 cell-specific model variants that, on a population-level replicate experimentally measured biomarker ranges and distributions, and in contrast to earlier studies, also match experimental biomarker values on a cell-by-cell basis. This model population may be regarded as a random sample from the phenotype of healthy rabbit ventricular myocytes. Uni-variate and bi-variate joint marginal distributions of the estimated parameters are presented, and the parameter dependencies of several commonly utilised electrophysiological biomarkers are revealed. Parameter values are weakly correlated, while summary metrics such as the action potential duration are not strongly dependent on any single electrophysiological characteristic of the myocyte. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately and efficiently fitting entire action potential waveforms at scale.

      <title>Rolling phase modulation regime for dynamic full field OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (DFFOCT) has recently emerged as an invaluable label-free microscopy technique, owing to its sensitivity to cell activity, as well as speed and sectioning ability. However, the quality of DFFOCT images are often degraded due to phase noise and fringe artifacts. In this work, we present a new implementation named Rolling-Phase (RP) DFFOCT, in which the reference arm is slowly scanned over magnitudes exceeding 2$\pi$. We demonstrate mathematically and experimentally that it shows superior image quality while enabling to extract both static and dynamic contrast simultaneously. We showcase RP DFFOCT on monkey retinal explant, and demonstrate its ability to better resolve subcellular structures, including intranuclear activity.</description>

      <title>Geomorphodynamics, evolution, and ecology of vertical roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The roots of some coastal and wetland trees grow peculiar vertical protrusions, the function of which remains unclear. Here, using computational simulations based on first-principles fluid and sedimentation dynamics, we argue that the protrusions work together to create an elevated patch of sediment downstream of the tree, thereby creating its own fertile flood-protected breeding grounds for the seedlings. In our simulations, we vary the vertical root diameter, root spacing and total root area and show that there is an optimal vertical root spacing that depends on root thickness. Next, we quantify and discuss the cooperative effects between adjacent vertical root patches. Lastly, by varying vertical root spacing of a patch of trees, we estimate a maximal vegetation density for which vertical root production has a beneficial geomorphological response. Our hypothesis suggests that vertical roots, such as the "knee roots" of baldcypress trees, have an important role in shaping riparian geomorphology and community structure.</description>

      <title>Easing Seasickness through Attention Redirection with a Mindfulness-Based Brain--Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: \textit{de novo} molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym}.</description>

      <title>A mathematical language for linking fine-scale structure in spikes from hundreds to thousands of neurons with behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural recording technology allow simultaneously recording action potentials from hundreds to thousands of neurons in awake, behaving animals. However, characterizing spike patterns in the resulting data, and linking these patterns to behaviour, remains a challenging task. The lack of a rigorous mathematical language for variable numbers of events (spikes) emitted by multiple agents (neurons) is an important limiting factor. We introduce a new mathematical operation to decompose complex spike patterns into a set of simple, structured elements. This creates a mathematical language that allows comparing spike patterns across trials, detecting sub-patterns, and making links to behaviour via a clear distance measure. We apply the method to dual Utah array recordings from macaque prefrontal cortex, where this technique reveals previously unseen structure that can predict both memory-guided decisions and errors in a virtual-reality working memory task. These results demonstrate that this technique provides a powerful new approach to understand structure in the spike times of neural populations, at a scale that will continue to grow more and more rapidly in upcoming years.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic camera for tracking passive and active matter with lower data throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the merits of using a neuromorphic, or event-based camera (EBC), for tracking of both passive and active matter. For passive matter, we tracked the Brownian motion of different micro-particles and estimated their diffusion coefficient. For active matter, we explored the case of tracking murine spermatozoa and extracted motility parameters from the motion of cells. This has applications in enhancing outcomes for clinical fertility treatments. Using the EBC, we obtain results equivalent to those from an sCMOS camera, yet achieve a reduction in file size of up to two orders of magnitude. This is important in the modern computer era, as it reduces data throughput, and is well-aligned with edge-computing applications. We believe the EBC is an excellent choice, particularly for long-term studies of active matter.</description>
