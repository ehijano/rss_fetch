      <title>Power quotients of surface groups and mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed, orientable, hyperbolic surface $S$. The $n$-power quotient, $\Gamma(n)$, is the quotient of $\Gamma$ by the $n$th powers of simple closed curves. We prove an analogue of the Dehn--Nielsen--Baer theorem for suitable large values of $n$: the outer automorphism group of $\Gamma(n)$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the extended mapping class group of $S$ by $n$th powers of Dehn twists. There is also a corresponding description of the automorphism group as the quotient of the extended mapping class group of the corresponding once-punctured surface, and we relate these groups via a Birman-type exact sequence. Along the way, and as consequences, we prove structural properties of $\Gamma(n)$ for suitable large values of $n$, including: $\Gamma(n)$ is virtually torsion-free, acylindrically hyperbolic, infinitely presented, with solvable word problem and finite asymptotic dimension.</description>

      <title>A combination theorem for the twist conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce a strong version of the twist conjecture for Artin groups to Artin groups whose defining graphs have no separating vertices. This produces new examples of Artin groups satisfying the conjecture, and sheds more light on the isomorphism problem for Artin groups. Along the way we also prove a combination result for the ribbon property for vertices.</description>

      <title>Stable commutator length on free $\mathbb{Q}$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stable commutator length on free $\mathbb{Q}$-groups. We prove that every non-identity element has positive stable commutator length, and that the corresponding free group embeds isometrically. We deduce that a non-abelian free $\mathbb{Q}$-group has an infinite-dimensional space of homogeneous quasimorphisms modulo homomorphisms, answering a question of Casals-Ruiz, Garreta, and de la Nuez Gonz{\'a}lez. We conjecture that stable commutator length is rational on free $\mathbb{Q}$-groups. This is connected to the long-standing problem of rationality on surface groups: indeed, we show that free $\mathbb{Q}$-groups contain isometrically embedded copies of non-orientable surface groups.</description>

      <title>On K3 surfaces with hyperbolic automorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the finiteness of the N\'eron-Severi lattices of complex projective K3 surfaces whose automorphism groups are non-elementary hyperbolic with explicit descriptions, under the assumption that the Picard number $\ge 6$ which is optimal to ensure the finiteness. Our proof of finiteness is based on the study of genus one fibrations on K3 surfaces and recent work of Kikuta and Takatsu.</description>

      <title>Almost reducibility, distortion and local perfection for diffeomorphisms of one-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the distortion elements of the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of the circle and of the group of compactly supported smooth diffeomorphisms of the real line. More precisely, we prove that, in this context, an element is distorted if and only if it is almost reducible, that is if and only if it has conjugates arbitrarily close to an isometry. For diffeomorphisms with fixed points, we show that this is equivalent to being the time-1 map of a C 1 vector field without hyperbolic zero. The equivalence between distortion and almost reducibility relies on new more general results about distortion elements in groups of diffeomorphisms of manifolds and on a new local perfection result for the group of compactly supported smooth diffeomorphisms of the real line.</description>

      <title>Borel--Serre type bordifications and Canonical Pairs for Loop groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the symmetric space of the (positive half) of a real loop group, we attach a Borel--Serre type bordification and equip it with a Hausdorff topology. The attached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is shown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space. This partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient.</description>

      <title>Density of finitely supported invariant measures for automorphisms of compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of invariant measures for continuous automorphisms of compact metrizable abelian groups satisfying the descending chain condition. We show that the finitely supported invariant measures are weak-* dense in the space of all invariant probability measures, and that if the system is ergodic with respect to Haar measure, then the finitely supported ergodic invariant measures are also dense. A key ingredient in the proof is a variant of the specification property, which we establish for the ergodic systems in this class. Our results also yield the following two consequences: first, that every finitely generated group that is a semidirect product of $\mathbb{Z}$ with a countable abelian group $G$ is Hilbert-Schmidt stable; and second, a Livshitz-type theorem characterizing the uniform closure of coboundaries arising from continuous functions in terms of vanishing on periodic orbits. We also construct an example showing that, in general dynamical systems, the property of having dense finitely supported invariant measures does not pass to product systems.</description>

      <title>Higher incoherence of the automorphism groups of a free group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the free group on $n \geq 2$ generators. We show that for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-3$ (respectively for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-4$) there exists a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ (respectively $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$) which has finiteness of type $F_{m}$ but not of type $FP_{m+1}(\mathbb{Q})$, hence it is not $m$-coherent. In both cases, the new result is the upper bound $m= 2n-3$ (respectively $m = 2n-4$), as it cannot be obtained by embedding direct products of free noncyclic groups, and certifies higher incoherence up to the virtual cohomological dimension and is therefore sharp. As a tool of the proof, we discuss the existence and nature of multiple inequivalent extensions of a suitable finite-index subgroup $K_4$ of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2)$ (isomorphic to the quotient of the pure braid group on four strands by its center): the fiber of four of these extensions arise from the strand-forgetting maps on the braid groups, while a fifth is related with the Cardano-Ferrari epimorphism.</description>

      <title>Prime simplicial complexes of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prime simplicial complex $\Pi(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is composed of all sets of primes $S$ where $G$ has an element of order the product of primes in $S$, with the subsets partially ordered by inclusion. This complex was introduced by Peter Cameron as the generalisation of the well-studied prime (or Gruenberg-Kegel) graphs. In this paper, we establish new results concerning two key properties of $\Pi(G)$: recognisability and purity. We demonstrate that recognisability by the prime simplicial complex is strictly stronger than recognisability by the prime graph. Notably, we present the first known example of a group that is recognisable by its prime simplicial complex and spectrum, but not by its prime graph, and is not a direct product of two isomorphic simple groups. Furthermore, we classify groups with pure prime simplicial complexes (i.e., all maximal simplices have the same size) across several infinite families of finite simple groups. We also provide a partial classification for non-abelian finite simple groups whose prime simplicial complex has maximal simplices of size at most 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>

      <title>Basic quasi-reductive root data and supergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate pairs $(G,Y)$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group and
  $Y$ a purely-odd $G$-superscheme, asking when a pair corresponds to a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup $\mathbb{G}$, that is, $\mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is isomorphic to $G$, and the quotient $\mathbb{G}\slash \mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is $G$-equivariantly isomorphic to $Y$. We prove that, if $Y$ satisfies certain conditions (basic quasi-reductive root data),
  then the question has a positive answer given by an existence and uniqueness theorem.
  The corresponding supergroups are said to be basic quasi-reductive, which can be classified, up to isogeny. We then decide the structure of connected quasi-reductive algebraic supergroups provided that: (i) the root system does not contain $0$; (ii) $\mathfrak{g}:=\text{Lie}(\mathbb{G})$ admits a non-degenerate even symmetric bilinear form. (iii) all odd reflections are invertible. Remarkably, those supergroups are exactly basic quasi-reductive supergroups of monodromy type.</description>

      <title>Bounding Entanglement Entropy with Clifford Double Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following on our previous work arXiv:2204.07593 and arXiv:2306.01043 studying the orbits of quantum states under Clifford circuits via `reachability graphs', we introduce `contracted graphs' whose vertices represent classes of quantum states with the same entropy vector. These contracted graphs represent the double cosets of the Clifford group, where the left cosets are built from the stabilizer subgroup of the starting state and the right cosets are built from the entropy-preserving operators. We study contracted graphs for stabilizer states, as well as W states and Dicke states, discussing how the diameter of a state's contracted graph constrains the `entropic diversity' of its $2$-qubit Clifford orbit. We derive an upper bound on the number of entropy vectors that can be generated using any $n$-qubit Clifford circuit, for any quantum state. We speculate on the holographic implications for the relative proximity of gravitational duals of states within the same Clifford orbit. Although we concentrate on how entropy evolves under the Clifford group, our double-coset formalism, and thus the contracted graph picture, is extendable to generic gate sets and generic state properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with a thick end whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the full-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups, and partially solves problems of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and of Georgakopoulos and Hamann.
  Additionally, we show that every (not necessarily quasi-transitive) graph of finite maximum degree which has a thick end and whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor.</description>
