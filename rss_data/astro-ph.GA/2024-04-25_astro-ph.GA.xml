      <title>Wandering intermediate-mass black holes in Milky Way-sized galaxies in cosmological simulations: myth or reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: ``can we use the current cosmological simulations to identify intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and quantify a putative population of wandering IMBHs?''. We compare wandering-IMBH counts in different simulations with different sub-grid methods and post-processing recipes, the ultimate goal being to aid future wandering-IMBH detection efforts. In particular, we examine simulations in which IMBHs are identified as BH seeds forming at high redshift and those in which they are identified using star clusters as proxies, which implicitly appeals to a stellar dynamical formation channel. In addition, we employ the extremely high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulation GigaEris with the star cluster proxies method to identify IMBHs. We find consistent counts of wandering high-redshift IMBHs across most of the different cosmological simulations employed so far in the literature, despite the different identification approaches, resulting in 5 to 18 wandering IMBHs per Milky Way-sized galaxy at $z \geq 3$. Nevertheless, we argue this is only coincidental, as a significant discrepancy arises when examining the formation sites and the mass ranges of the wandering IMBHs. Furthermore, we cannot determine how many of the IMBHs identified at high redshift in GigaEris will be wandering IMBHs at $z = 0$ as opposed to how many will accrete to the central supermassive BH, promoting its growth. All of this casts doubts on the ability of current cosmological simulations to inform observational searches for wandering IMBHs.</description>

      <title>A Spatially Resolved [CII] Survey of 31 $z\sim7$ Massive Galaxies Hosting Luminous Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum are important tracers for studying star formation and kinematic properties of early galaxies. We present a survey of the [CII] emission lines and FIR continua of 31 luminous quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) at sub-arcsec resolution. This survey more than doubles the number of quasars with [CII] and FIR observations at these redshifts and enables statistical studies of quasar host galaxies deep into the epoch of reionization. We detect [CII] emission in 27 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of $L_{\rm [CII]}=(0.3-5.5)\times10^9~L_\odot$ and detect the FIR continuum of 28 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of $L_{\rm FIR}=(0.5-13.0)\times10^{12}~L_\odot$. Both $L_{\rm [CII]}$ and $L_{\rm FIR}$ are correlated ($\rho\simeq0.4$) with the quasar bolometric luminosity, albeit with substantial scatter. The quasar hosts detected by ALMA are clearly resolved with a median diameter of $\sim$5 kpc. About 40% of the quasar host galaxies show a velocity gradient in [CII] emission, while the rest show either dispersion-dominated or disturbed kinematics. Basic estimates of the dynamical masses of the rotation-dominated host galaxies yield $M_{\rm dyn}=(0.1-7.5)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$. Considering our findings alongside those of literature studies, we found that the ratio between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $M_{\rm dyn}$ is about ten times higher than that of local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm dyn}$ relation on average but with substantial scatter (the ratio difference ranging from $\sim$0.6 to 60) and large uncertainties.</description>

      <title>What drives the corpulence of galaxies? I. The formation of central compact dwarf galaxies in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby dwarf galaxies display a variety of effective radii (sizes) at given stellar mass, suggesting different evolution scenarios according to their final "stellar" size. The TNG hydrodynamical simulations present a bimodality in the z = 0 size-mass relation (SMRz0) of dwarf galaxies, at $r_{1/2,\star}$ ~ 450 pc. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explore the evolution of the most massive progenitors of dwarf galaxies (z=0 $\log( M_\star / \mathrm{M}_\odot)$ between 8.4 and 9.2) that ended up as central galaxies of their groups. We split these dwarfs into three classes of the SMRz0: Normals from the central spine of the main branch and Compacts from the secondary branch as well as from the lower envelope of the main branch. Both classes of Compacts see their stellar sizes decrease since z ~ 1 in contrast to Normals, while the sizes of the gas and dark matter (DM) components keep increasing (as for Normals). A detailed analysis reveals that Compacts live in poorer environments, thus suffer fewer major mergers since z=0.8 that otherwise pump angular momentum into the gas, allowing strong gas inflows, producing inner star formation, hence the buildup of a stellar core. Compacts are predicted to be rounder and with bluer cores. Compact dwarfs of similar sizes are observed in the GAMA survey, but the bimodality in sizes is less evident and the most compact dwarfs tend to be passive rather than star forming as in TNG50. Therefore, our conclusions should be confirmed with future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Are early-type galaxies quenched by present-day environment? A study of dwarfs in the Fornax Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies undergo processes throughout their lifetimes that ultimately lead to the expulsion of the gas and the cessation of the star-forming activity. This phenomenon commonly known as quenching, can be caused by environmental processes. For this we use the results of Romero-G\'omez et al. (2024), who analyzed galaxies from the SAMI-Fornax and ATLAS$^{3D}$ survey. Using t$_{90}$ as an approximation for the quenching time and comparing it with the infall time derived from phase-space models, we determine the probability of the quenching being produced by the local environment of galaxies. Our results reveal a relation between galaxy mass and quenching probability. Down to M$_{\star}$ $\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, galaxies exhibit almost zero probability of quenching, suggesting their independence from environmental effects. As we move into the mass regime of dwarf galaxies, the probability increases with decreasing mass, highlighting their sensitivity to environmental quenching. For the dwarfs, 10$^{7}$ - 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, 36$\pm$9% of our observational data are consistent with this hypothesis, challenging the idea that the present-day cluster, Fornax, is the primary driver of quenching in the low mass galaxies. We compare these results with cosmological simulations, selecting galaxies under similar conditions to our observational sample. The simulated sample shows lower quenching probabilities as we move down in mass, only 5$\pm$1% of galaxies meet the quenching criteria. This discrepancy between observations and simulations underlines that modelling quenching is still in its infancy. In general, the number of observed galaxies quenched by their environment is lower than expected, which suggests that pre-processing plays a larger role in galaxy evolution. Ultimately, our results highlight the need for higher-quality simulations and refinement of galaxy formation and evolution models.</description>

      <title>NGC1856: Using machine learning techniques to uncover detailed stellar abundances from MUSE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of the novel approach based on data-driven machine learning methods applied to \textit{Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer} (MUSE) field data to derive stellar abundances of star clusters. MUSE has been used to target more than 10,000 fields, and it is unique in its ability to study dense stellar fields such as stellar clusters providing spectra for each individual star. We use MUSE data of the extragalactic young stellar cluster NGC 1856, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present the individual stellar [Fe/H] abundance of 327 cluster members in addition to [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] abundances of subsample sets. Our results match the LMC abundances obtained in the literature for [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe]. This study is the first to derive [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe] abundances for this cluster. The revolutionary combination of integral-field spectroscopy and data-driven modeling will allow us to understand the chemical enrichment of star clusters and their host galaxies in greater detail expanding our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Spatial segregation of massive clusters in a simulation of colliding dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective properties of star clusters are investigated using a simulation of the collision between two dwarf galaxies. The characteristic power law of the cluster mass function, N(M), with a slope dlog N/dlog M ~ -1, is present from cluster birth and remains throughout the simulation. The maximum mass of a young cluster scales with the star formation rate (SFR). The relative average minimum separation, R(M)= N(M)^{1/p}D_min(M)/D(M_low), for average minimum distance D_min(M) between clusters of mass M, and for lowest mass, M_low, measured in projection (p=2) or three dimensions (p=3), has a negative slope, dlog R/dlog M ~ -0.2, for all masses and ages. This agrees with observations of R(M) in low-mass galaxies studied previously. Like the slope of N(M), R}(M) is apparently a property of cluster birth for dwarf galaxies that does not depend on SFR or time. The negative slope for R(M) implies that more massive clusters are centrally concentrated relative to lower mass clusters throughout the entire mass range. Cluster growth through coalescence is also investigated. The ratio of the kinetic to potential energy of all near-neighbor clusters is generally large, but a tail of low values in the distribution of this ratio suggests that a fraction of the clusters merge, ~8% by number throughout the ~300 Myr of the simulation and up to 60% by mass for young clusters in their first 10 Myr, scaling with the SFR above a certain threshold.</description>

      <title>USmorph: An Updated Framework of Automatic Classification of Galaxy Morphologies and Its Application to Galaxies in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological classification conveys abundant information on the formation, evolution, and environment of galaxies. In this work, we refine the two-step galaxy morphological classification framework ({\tt\string USmorph}), which employs a combination of unsupervised machine learning (UML) and supervised machine learning (SML) techniques, along with a self-consistent and robust data preprocessing step. The updated method is applied to the galaxies with $I_{\rm mag}&lt;25$ at $0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2$ in the COSMOS field. Based on their HST/ACS I-band images, we classify them into five distinct morphological types: spherical (SPH, 15,200), early-type disk (ETD, 17,369), late-type disk (LTD, 21,143), irregular disk (IRR, 28,965), and unclassified (UNC, 17,129). In addition, we have conducted both parametric and nonparametric morphological measurements. For galaxies with stellar masses exceeding $10^{9}M_{\sun}$, a gradual increase in effective radius from SPHs to IRRs is observed, accompanied by a decrease in the S\'{e}rsic index. Nonparametric morphologies reveal distinct distributions of galaxies across the $Gini-M_{20}$ and $C-A$ parameter spaces for different categories. Moreover, different categories exhibit significant dissimilarity in their $G_2$ and $\Psi$ distributions. We find morphology to be strongly correlated with redshift and stellar mass. The consistency of these classification results with expected correlations among multiple parameters underscores the validity and reliability of our classification method, rendering it a valuable tool for future studies.</description>

      <title>Galaxies' properties in the Fundamental Plane across time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Using the Illustris-1 and IllustrisTNG-100 simulations we investigate the properties of the Fundamental Plane (FP), that is the correlation between the effective radius Re, the effective surface intensity Ie and the central stellar velocity dispersion (sigma) of galaxies, at different cosmic epochs.
  Aims: Our aim is to study the properties of galaxies in the FP and its projections across time, adopting samples covering different intervals of mass. We would like to demonstrate that the position of a galaxy in the FP space strongly depends on its degree of evolution, that might be represented by the beta and L'_0 parameters entering the L-sigma^beta(t) law.
  Methods: Starting from the comparison of the basic relations among the structural parameters of artificial and real galaxies at low redshift, we obtain the fit of the FP and its coefficients at different cosmic epochs for samples of different mass limits. Then, we analyze the dependence of the galaxy position in the FP space as a function of the beta parameter and the star formation rate (SFR).
  Results: We find that: 1) the coefficients of the FP change with the mass range of the galaxy sample; 2) the low luminous and less massive galaxies do not share the same FP of the bright massive galaxies; 3) the scatter around the fitted FP is quite small at any epoch and increases when the mass interval increases; 4) the distribution of galaxies in the FP space strongly depends on the $\beta$ values (i.e. on the degree of virialization and the star formation rate).
  Conclusions: The FP is a complex surface that is well approximated by a plane only when galaxies share similar masses and condition of virialization.</description>

      <title>First detection of the [CII] 158 micron line in the intermediate-velocity cloud Draco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-latitude intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) are part of the Milky Way's HI halo and originate from either a galactic fountain process or extragalactic gas infall. They are partly molecular and can most of the time be identified in CO. Some of these regions also exhibit high-velocity cloud (HVC) gas, which is mostly atomic, and gas at local velocities (LVCs), which is partly atomic and partly molecular. We conducted a study on the IVCs Draco and Spider, both were exposed to a very weak UV field, using the receiver upGREAT on SOFIA. The 158 micron line of ionized carbon (CII) was observed, and the results are as follows: In Draco, the CII line was detected at intermediate velocities (but not at local or high velocities) in four out of five positions. No CII emission was found at any velocity in the two observed positions in Spider. To understand the excitation conditions of the gas in Draco, we analyzed complementary CO and HI data as well as dust column density and temperature maps from Herschel. The observed CII intensities suggest the presence of shocks in Draco that heat the gas and subsequently emit in the CII cooling line. These shocks are likely caused by the fast cloud's motion toward the Galactic plane that is accompanied by collisions between HI clouds. The nondetection of CII in the Spider IVC and LVC as well as in other low-density clouds at local velocities that we present in this paper (Polaris and Musca) supports the idea that highly dynamic processes are necessary for CII excitation in UV-faint low-density regions.</description>

      <title>Parsec-scale cosmic-ray ionisation rate in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays regulate the dynamics and the chemical processes in the densest and coldest regions of the ISM. Still, the determination of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate of H$_2$ (${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}$) is plagued by uncertainties in the adopted chemical networks and the analysis techniques. This work aims to homogeneously estimate the ${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}$ at parsec scales towards the Orion Molecular Clouds OMC-2 and OMC-3, probing its variation across a whole star-forming region and a range of column densities never explored before. The most recent ${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}$ estimates are based on o$-$H$_2$D$^+$, whose abundance we proxy through CO depletion taking advantage of the existing correlation between the two parameters. We therefore employ observations of C$^{18}$O (2$-$1), HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) and DCO$^+$ (3$-$2) towards OMC-2 and OMC-3 to determine the depletion factor, the deuteration fraction and, ultimately, a map of ${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}$ in these two regions. The depletion factors and deuteration fractions correlate with the total column density of H$_2$, the N$_2$H$^+$ emission and the coldest fields across OMC-2 and OMC-3. The cosmic-ray ionisation rate shows values of ${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}\sim5\times10^{-18}-10^{-16}$~s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous o$-$H$_2$D$^+$-based estimates. In addition, it shows an overall decrease for increasing $N(\mathrm{H_2}$), consistently with the predictions from theoretical models. Our approach provides results comparable with theoretical predictions and previous independent studies, confirming the robustness of the analytical framework and the viability of CO depletion as proxy for o$-$H$_2$D$^+$. By exploring the major limitations of the method, we suggest interferometric observations as mandatory to reliably constrain the ${\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}}$ also at parsec scales.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of the Horsehead photon-dominated region I. First results from multi-band near- and mid-infrared imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST has captured the sharpest IR images ever taken of the Horsehead nebula, a prototypical moderately irradiated PDR that is fully representative of most of the UV-illuminated molecular gas in the Milky Way and star-forming galaxies. We investigate the impact of FUV radiation of a molecular cloud and constrain the structure of the edge of the PDR and its illumination conditions. We used NIRCam and MIRI to obtain 17 broadband and 6 narrowband maps from 0.7 to 28 $\mu$m. We mapped the dust emission, scattered light, and several gas phase lines. We also used HST-WFC3 maps at 1.1 and 1. 6 $\mu$m, along with HST-STIS spectroscopic observations of the H$\alpha$ line. We probed the structure of the edge of the Horsehead and resolved its spatial complexity. We detected a network of faint striated features extending perpendicularly to the PDR front into the H\,II region in filters sensitive to nano-grain emission and light scattered by larger grains. This may indeed figure as the first detection of the entrainment of dust particles in the evaporative flow. The map of the 1-0 S(1) line of H$_2$ presents sharp sub-structures on scales as small as 1.5 arcsec. The ionization and dissociation fronts appear at distances 1-2 arcsec behind the edge of the PDR and seem to spatially coincide, indicating a thickness of the neutral atomic layer below 100 au. All broadband maps present strong color variations which can be explained by dust attenuation. Deviations of the emissions in the H$\alpha$, Pa$\alpha,$ and Br$\alpha$ lines also indicate dust attenuation. With a very simple model, we derive the main features of the extinction curve. A small excess of extinction at 3 $\mu$m may be attributed to icy H$_2$O mantles onto grains. In all lines of sight crossing the inner regions of the Horsehead, it appears that dust attenuation is non-negligible over the entire spectral range.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical hub-filament structures and gas inflows on galaxy-cloud scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the kinematics and dynamics of gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales in two spiral galaxies NGC5236 (M83) and NGC4321 (M100) using CO (2$-$1) line. We utilized the FILFINDER algorithm on integrated intensity maps for the identification of filaments in two galaxies. Clear fluctuations in velocity and density were observed along these filaments, enabling the fitting of velocity gradients around intensity peaks. The variations in velocity gradient across different scales suggest a gradual and consistent increase in velocity gradient from large to small scales, indicative of gravitational collapse, something also revealed by the correlation between velocity dispersion and column density of gas structures. Gas structures at different scales in the galaxy may be organized into hierarchical systems through gravitational coupling. All the features of gas kinematics on galaxy-cloud scale are very similar to that on cloud-clump and clump-core scales studied in previous works. Thus, the interstellar medium from galaxy to dense core scales presents multi-scale/hierarchical hub-filament structures. Like dense core as the hub in clump, clump as the hub in molecular cloud, now we verify that cloud or cloud complex can be the hub in spiral galaxies. Although the scaling relations and the measured velocity gradients support the gravitational collapse of gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales, the collapse is much slower than a pure free-fall gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Galaxy properties from the outskirts to the core of a protocluster at z=3.699</title>

Abstract: We present follow-up spectroscopy on a protocluster candidate selected from the wide-field imaging of the Hyper SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Programme. The target protocluster candidate was identified as a $4.5\sigma$ overdense region of $g$-dropout galaxies, and the redshifts of $g$-dropout galaxies are determined by detecting their Ly$\alpha$ emission. Thirteen galaxies, at least, are found to be clustering in the narrow redshift range of $\Delta z&lt;0.05$ at $z=3.699$. This is clear evidence of the presence of a protocluster in the target region. Following the discovery of the protocluster at $z=3.699$, the physical properties and three-dimensional distribution of its member galaxies are investigated. Based on spectroscopically-confirmed $g$-dropout galaxies, we find an overabundance of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) bright galaxies in the protocluster. The UV brightest protocluster member turns out to be an active galactic nucleus, and the other UV brighter members tend to show smaller Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths than field counterparts. The member galaxies tend to densely populate near the centre of the protocluster, but the separation from the nearest neighbour rather than the distance from the centre of the protocluster is more tightly correlated to galaxy properties, implying that the protocluster is still in an early phase of cluster formation and only close neighbours have a significant impact on the physical properties of protocluster members. The number density of massive galaxies, selected from an archival photometric-redshift catalogue, is higher near the centre of the protocluster, while dusty starburst galaxies are distributed on the outskirts. These observational results suggest that the protocluster consists of multiple galaxy populations, whose spatial distributions may hint at the developmental phase of the galaxy cluster.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Himalayas: The Highest Quasar Density Peak Identified in a 10,000 deg$^2$ Sky with Spatial Discrepancies between Galaxies, Quasars, and IGM HI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the identification of a quasar overdensity in the BOSSJ0210 field, dubbed Cosmic Himalayas, consisting of 11 quasars at $z=2.16-2.20$, the densest overdensity of quasars ($17\sigma$) in the $\sim$10,000 deg$^2$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present the spatial distributions of galaxies and quasars and an HI absorption map of the intergalactic medium (IGM). On the map of 465 galaxies selected from the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey, we find two galaxy density peaks that do not fall on the quasar overdensity but instead exist at the northwest and southeast sides, approximately 25 $h^{-1}$ comoving-Mpc apart from the quasar overdensity. With a spatial resolution of 15 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc in projection, we produce a three-dimensional HI tomography map by the IGM Ly$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of 23 SDSS/eBOSS quasars behind the quasar overdensity. Surprisingly, the quasar overdensity coincides with neither an absorption peak nor a transmission peak of IGM HI but lies near the border separating opaque and transparent volumes, with the more luminous quasars located in an environment with lesser IGM HI. Hence remarkably, the overdensity region traced by the 11 quasars, albeit all in coherently active states, has no clear coincidence with peaks of galaxies or HI absorption densities. Current physical scenarios with mixtures of HI overdensities and quasar photoionization cannot fully interpret the emergence of Cosmic Himalayas, suggesting this peculiar structure is an excellent laboratory to unveil the interplay between galaxies, quasars, and the IGM.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Confirmation of an Ultra-Massive Galaxy in a Protocluster at $z \sim 4.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy (UMG) with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.98 \pm 0.09$ at $z_\mathrm{spec} = 4.8947$ in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), based on deep observations of Ly$\alpha$ emission with Keck/DEIMOS. The ultra-massive galaxy (UMG-28740) is the most massive member in one of the most significant overdensities in the EGS, with four additional photometric members with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10.5$ within $R_\mathrm{proj} \sim 1$ cMpc. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using a large suite of star formation histories and two sets of high-quality photometry from ground- and space-based facilities consistently estimates the mass of this object to be $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 11$ with a small standard deviation between measurements ($\sigma = 0.09$). While the best-fit SED models agree on stellar mass, we find discrepancies in the estimated star formation rate for UMG-28740, resulting in either a star-forming or quiescent system. $\mathit{JWST}$/NIRCam photometry of UMG-28740 strongly favors a quiescent scenario, demonstrating the need for high-quality mid-IR observations. Assuming the galaxy to be quiescent, UMG-28740 formed the bulk of its stars at $z &gt; 10$ and is quenching at $z \sim 8$, resulting in a high star formation efficiency at high redshift ($\epsilon \sim 0.2$ at $z \sim 5$ and $\epsilon \gtrsim 1$ at $z \gtrsim 8$). As the most massive galaxy in its protocluster environment, UMG-28740 is a unique example of the impossibly early galaxy problem.</description>

      <title>JWST detections of amorphous and crystalline HDO ice toward massive protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to utilize the increased sensitivity and resolution of the JWST to quantify the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in ices toward young stellar objects (YSOs) and to determine if the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the gas phase toward massive YSOs (MYSOs) are representative of the ratios in their ice envelopes. Two protostars observed in the Investigating Protostellar Accretion (IPA) program using JWST NIRSpec were analyzed: HOPS 370, an intermediate-mass YSO (IMYSO), and IRAS 20126+4104, a MYSO. The HDO ice toward these sources was detected above the 3$\sigma$ level and quantified via its 4.1 $\mu$m band. The contributions from the CH$_{3}$OH combination modes to the observed optical depth in this spectral region were constrained via the CH$_{3}$OH 3.53 $\mu$m band to ensure that the integrated optical depth of the HDO feature was not overestimated. H$_{2}$O ice was quantified via its 3 $\mu$m band. From these fits, ice HDO/H$_{2}$O abundance ratios of 4.6$\pm$1.8$\times$10$^{-3}$ and 2.6$\pm$1.2$\times$10$^{-3}$ are obtained for HOPS 370 and IRAS 20126+4104, respectively. The simultaneous detections of both crystalline HDO and crystalline H$_{2}$O corroborate the assignment of the observed feature at 4.1 $\mu$m to HDO ice. The ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios are similar to the highest reported gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward MYSOs as well as the hot inner regions of isolated low-mass protostars, suggesting that at least some of the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward massive hot cores are representative of the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios in ices. The need for an H$_{2}$O-rich CH$_{3}$OH component in the CH$_{3}$OH ice analysis supports recent experimental and observational results that indicate that some CH$_{3}$OH ice may form prior to the CO freeze-out stage in H$_{2}$O-rich ice layers.</description>

      <title>Synthetic stellar spectra to study multiple populations in globular clusters: an extended grid and the effects on the integrated light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) harbour multiple populations of stars (MPs), composed of at least two generations: the first characterized by a "standard" $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture, as observed in field halo stars of the Milky Way, and the second displaying anti-correlated CN--ONa chemical abundance pattern in combination with an enhanced helium fraction. Adequate collections of stellar spectra are needed to characterize the effect of such stellar abundance changes on the integrated light of GCs. We present a grid of synthetic stellar spectra covering the atmospheric parameters relevant to old stellar populations at four subsolar metallicities and two abundance patterns, representative of first- and second-generations of stars in GCs. Integrated spectra of populations were computed using our stellar grid and empirical stellar populations, namely, colour-magnitude diagrams from literature for Galactic GCs. The spectra range from 290 to 1000nm, where we measured the effect on several spectrophotometric indices due to the surface abundance variations attributed to MPs. We find non-negligible effects of the MPs on spectroscopic indices sensitive to C, N, Ca, or Na, and on Balmer indices; we also describe how MPs modify specific regions in the near-UV and near-IR that can be measured with narrow or medium photometric passbands. The effects vary with metallicity. A number of these changes remain detectable even when accounting for the stochastic fluctuations due to the finite nature of the stellar population cluster.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Violent relaxation in one-dimensional self-gravitating system: deviation from the Vlasov limit due to finite-$N$ effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a finite particle number $N$ on the violent relaxation leading to the Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) in a one-dimensional self-gravitating system. From the theoretical point of view, we demonstrate that the local Poissonian fluctuations embedded in the initial state give rise to an additional term proportional to $1/N$ in the Vlasov equation. This term designates the strength of the local mean-field variations by fluctuations. Because it is of the mean-field origin, we interpret it differently from the known collision term in the way that it effects the violent relaxation stage. Its role is to deviate the distribution function from the Vlasov limit, in the collisionless manner, at a rate proportional to $1/N$ while the violent relaxation is progressing. This hypothesis is tested by inspecting the QSSs in simulations of various $N$. We observe that the core phase-space density can exceed the limiting density deduced from the Vlasov equation and its deviation degree is in accordance with the $1/N$ estimate. This indicates the deviation from the standard mean-field approximation of the violent relaxation process by that $1/N$ term. In conclusion, the finite-$N$ effect has a significant contribution to the QSS apart from that it plays a role in the collisional stage that takes place long after. The conventional collisionless Vlasov equation might not be able to describe the violent relaxation of a system of particles properly without the correction term of the local finite-$N$ fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-equilibrium chemical evolution in starless cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemistry of H2O, CO and other small molecular species in an isolated pre-stellar core, L1544, has been assessed in the context of a comprehensive gas-grain chemical model, coupled to an empirically constrained physical/dynamical model. Our main findings are (i) that the chemical network remains in near equilibrium as the core evolves towards star formation and the molecular abundances change in response to the evolving physical conditions. The gas-phase abundances at any time can be calculated accurately with equilibrium chemistry, and the concept of chemical clocks is meaningless in molecular clouds with similar conditions and dynamical time scales, and (ii) A comparison of the results of complex and simple chemical networks indicates that the abundances of the dominant oxygen and carbon species, H2O, CO, C, and C+ are reasonably approximated by simple networks. In chemical equilibrium, the time-dependent differential terms vanish and a simple network reduces to a few algebraic equations. This allows rapid calculation of the abundances most responsible for spectral line radiative cooling in molecular clouds with long dynamical time scales. The dust ice mantles are highly structured and the ice layers retain a memory of the gas-phase abundances at the time of their deposition. A complex (gas-phase and gas-grain) chemical structure therefore exists, with cosmic-ray induced processes dominating in the inner regions. The inferred H2O abundance profiles for L1544 require that the outer parts of the core and also any medium exterior to the core are essentially transparent to the interstellar radiation field.</description>

      <title>Two Distinct Classes of Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation at Cosmic Noon (1&lt;z&lt;3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlights two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We select a conservative sample of low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct populations at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim10.3$: low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with spheroidal morphologies and older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent size-mass relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations also corresponds with other dramatic changes and characteristic masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations (e.g. star-formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Star clusters forming in a low metallicity starburst -- rapid self-enrichment by (very) massive stars</title>

Abstract: Stellar winds of massive ($\gtrsim9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and very massive ($\gtrsim100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stars may play an important role in the metal-enrichment during the formation of star clusters. With novel high-resolution hydrodynamical \textsc{griffin}-project simulations, we investigate the rapid recycling of stellar wind-material during the formation of massive star clusters up to $M_\mathrm{cluster}\sim2\times10^5\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy starburst. The simulation realises new stars from a stellar initial mass function (IMF) between $0.08\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\sim400\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and follows stellar winds, radiation and supernova-feedback of single massive stars with evolution tracks. Star clusters form on timescales less than $\sim5$ Myr, and their supernova-material is very inefficiently recycled. Stellar wind-material, however, is trapped in massive clusters resulting in the formation of stars self-enriched in Na, Al, and N within only a few Myr. Wind-enriched (second population) stars can be centrally concentrated in the most massive clusters ($\gtrsim10^4\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and the locked wind-material increases approximately as $M_\mathrm{cluster}^{2}$. These trends resemble the characteristics of observed second population stars in globular clusters. We fit scaling relations to the log-normal distributed wind-mass fractions and extrapolate to possible globular cluster progenitors of $M_\mathrm{cluster}=10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to investigate whether a dominant second population could form. This can only happen if the IMF is well sampled, single massive stars produce at least a factor of a few more enriched winds e.g. through a top-heavy IMF, and a significant fraction of the first population (unenriched) stars is lost during cluster evolution.</description>

      <title>The Multilayer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>

Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs' distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

Abstract: The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\times 10^3M_\odot$ and $4.2\times 10^4M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.</description>

      <title>Identification of the weak-to-strong transition in Alfv\'enic turbulence from space plasma</title>

Abstract: Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales in astrophysical and space plasma systems. Although the theory of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence has successfully described phenomena in nature, its core prediction of an Alfvenic transition from weak to strong MHD turbulence when energy cascades from large to small scales has not been observationally confirmed. Here we report the first observational evidence for the Alfvenic weak-to-strong transition in MHD turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath using the four Cluster spacecraft. The observed transition indicates the universal existence of strong turbulence regardless of the initial level of MHD fluctuations. Moreover, the observations demonstrate that the nonlinear interactions of MHD turbulence play a crucial role in the energy cascade, widening the directions of the energy cascade and broadening the fluctuating frequencies. Our work takes a critical step toward understanding the complete picture of turbulence cascade, connecting the weak and strong MHD turbulence systems. It will have broad implications in star formation, energetic particle transport, turbulent dynamo, and solar corona or solar wind heating.</description>

      <title>The SN 2023ixf Progenitor in M101: II. Properties</title>

Abstract: We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive pre-explosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the SN, as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assume a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust-obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found median estimates of the star's effective temperature and luminosity of 2770 K and 9.0e4 L_Sun, with 68% credible intervals of 2340--3150 K and (7.5--10.9)e4 L_sun. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC -10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M_sun to as high as 14 M_sun. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Investigating Protostellar Accretion-Driven Outflows Across the Mass Spectrum: JWST NIRSpec IFU 3-5~$\mu$m Spectral Mapping of Five Young Protostars</title>

Abstract: Investigating Protostellar Accretion is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI integral field units to obtain 2.9--28 $\mu$m spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2-10,000 L$_{\odot}$ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9--5.3 $\mu$m data of the inner 840-9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28-300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission; deep ice absorption; emission from H$_{2}$, H~I, and [Fe~II]; and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe~II] for the four $&lt; 320$~L$_{\odot}$ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Br-$\alpha$. Knots of [Fe~II] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [FeII] emission with dynamical times of $&lt; 30$~yrs are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H$_2$, knots of H$_2$ and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H$_2$ is seen extending through the cavities, showing that they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H$_2$ emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities narrow shells of H$_2$ emission are found, one of which has an [Fe~II] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.</description>

      <title>Retrievals of Protoplanetary Disk Parameters using Thermochemical Models: I. Disk Gas Mass from Hydrogen Deuteride Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss statistical relationships between the mass of protoplanetary disks and the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line emission and the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) determined using 3000 ProDiMo disk models. The models have 15 free parameters describing disk physical properties, the central star, and the local radiation field. The sampling of physical parameters is done using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the probability density functions of observables as a function of physical parameters. We find that the HD fractional abundance is almost constant even though the UV flux varies by several orders of magnitude. Probing the statistical relation between the physical quantities and the HD flux, we find that low-mass (optically thin) disks display a tight correlation between the average disk gas temperature and HD line flux, while massive disks show no such correlation. We demonstrate that the central star luminosity, disk size, dust size distribution, and HD flux may be used to determine the disk gas mass to within a factor of three. We also find that the far-IR and sub-mm/mm SEDs and the HD flux may serve as strong constraints for determining the disk gas mass to within a factor of two. If the HD lines are fully spectrally resolved ($R\gtrsim 1.5\times10^6, \Delta v=0.2~\rm km\,s^{-1}$), the 56 $\mu$m and 112 $\mu$m HD line profiles alone may constrain the disk gas mass to within a factor of two.</description>

      <title>The effect of reionization on direct measurements of the mean free path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the ionizing photon mean free path (MFP) based on composite quasar spectra may point to reionization ending at $z&lt;6$. These measurements are challenging because they rely on assumptions about the proximity zones of the quasars. For example, some quasars might have been close to neutral patches where reionization was still ongoing ("neutral islands"), and it is unclear how they would affect the measurements. We address this question with mock MFP measurements from radiative transfer simulations. We find that, even in the presence of neutral islands, our mock MFP measurements agree to within $30~\%$ with the true spatially averaged MFP in our simulations, which includes opacity from both the ionized medium and the islands. The inferred MFP is sensitive at the $&lt;~50\%$ level to assumptions about quasar environments and lifetimes for realistic models. We demonstrate that future analyses with improved data may require explicitly modeling the effects of neutral islands on the composite spectra, and we outline a method for doing this. Lastly, we quantify the effects of neutral islands on Lyman-series transmission, which has been modeled with optically thin simulations in previous MFP analyses. Neutral islands can suppress transmission at $\lambda_{\rm rest}&lt;912$ Angstroms significantly, up to a factor of 2 for $z_{\rm qso}=6$ in a plausible reionization scenario, owing to absorption by many closely spaced lines as quasar light redshifts into resonance. However, the suppression is almost entirely degenerate with the spectrum normalization and thus does not significantly bias the inferred MFP.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves in gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of four-geometries exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves. These are found as explicit solutions to 5D vacuum Hilbert-Palatini theory, where the fifth dimen sion has vanishing proper length. In the emergent 4D dynamics, governed by the condition that the Ricci scalar must vanish (upto a cosmological constant), these correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. The enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo is obtained, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is predicted to be $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is different from the result for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>
