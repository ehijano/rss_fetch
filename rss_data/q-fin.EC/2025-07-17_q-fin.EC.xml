      <title>Orchestrating the Implementation of the Smart City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores the six core dimensions of smart cities (i.e. smart economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and governance) emphasizing their interdependence and the need for holistic orchestration. Building on Giffinger et al. (2007) and subsequent literature, it argues that integrating these dimensions is crucial for sustainable urban development. ICT plays a key enabling role but must be complemented by human and social capital. Through institutional examples, such as the creation of dedicated municipal offices for digital innovation, the chapter illustrates how governance and internal capacity shape smart transitions. A human-centric approach is also essential, ensuring inclusivity, creativity, and active civic participation. Ultimately, smart cities must be viewed as cohesive urban ecosystems where technology, people, and governance interact dynamically.</description>

      <title>International promotion patterns in the smart city literature: Exploring the role of geography in affecting local drivers and smart cities' outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of smart cities represents a significant trend in urban development. However, only in recent years has attention shifted toward the international promotion of these cities. Despite ongoing academic discussions on the impact of smart city development on urban environments, the global recognition of smart cities remains uncertain due to their multidisciplinary nature. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in top-tier peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to December 2021, offering a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Causality analysis of electricity market liberalization on electricity price using novel Machine Learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relationships between the energy and the finance markets are increasingly important. Understanding these relationships is vital for policymakers and other stakeholders as the world faces challenges such as satisfying humanity's increasing need for energy and the effects of climate change. In this paper, we investigate the causal effect of electricity market liberalization on the electricity price in the US. By performing this analysis, we aim to provide new insights into the ongoing debate about the benefits of electricity market liberalization. We introduce Causal Machine Learning as a new approach for interventions in the energy-finance field. The development of machine learning in recent years opened the door for a new branch of machine learning models for causality impact, with the ability to extract complex patterns and relationships from the data. We discuss the advantages of causal ML methods and compare the performance of ML-based models to shed light on the applicability of causal ML frameworks to energy policy intervention cases. We find that the DeepProbCP framework outperforms the other frameworks examined. In addition, we find that liberalization of, and individual players' entry to, the electricity market resulted in a 7% decrease in price in the short term.</description>

      <title>The Case against Scale: Empirical Evidence of Underperformance in Large Secondary Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper analyses the increasing popularity of large funds in the secondary private equity market, which are pegged on the perceived larger scale advantages of operational efficiency and fewer manager relationships (Reuter &amp; Zitzewitz, 2021). However, it has been proved empirically that smaller funds perform better than the big ones in terms of their internal rates of return (IRRs). This work questions this authoritative view, providing evidence of outperformance of smaller funds relative to their larger counterparts. This research shows us the benefits that smaller funds possess. Thus, investors must revisit their allocation strategy to prioritize larger funds automatically (Gualandris et al.,2021).</description>

      <title>AI Diffusion to Low- and Middle Income Countries; A Blessing or a Curse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advances in AI have incited extensive inquiry into its effects on productivity and labor, potentially profound in both positive and negative ways. Often neglected, however, is comprehension of how AI technologies diffuse across and within economies. Developing nations, in particular, face substantial labor market impacts from either swift AI adoption or diminished competitiveness from sluggish diffusion. This paper examines the literature on technology diffusion and proposes a tripartite framework to elucidate AI diffusion pathways: global value chains, research collaboration, and inter-firm knowledge transfers. Employing these metrics, it evaluates AI diffusion in sixteen lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) relative to four developed nations and assesses their dependency on the USA and China. Findings reveal a notable gap in AI diffusion between developed and developing economies, though this chasm is gradually closing. China emerges as a vital source of future diffusion via value chains, while the USA wields greater influence through research and knowledge transfers. Limitations include the exclusion of certain data sources and regions, and the absence of quantitative analysis on diffusion's relationship with technology intensity. Nonetheless, the research surfaces critical macro-level considerations about AI diffusion. It advocates mechanisms to redistribute AI-induced economic gains and bilateral agreements to complement international accords, thereby addressing the diverse needs and risks of economies entering an AI-dominated era. Future inquiries should explore the nexus between AI diffusion, technology intensity, and productivity; refine diffusion measurement methods; incorporate case studies and targeted policy recommendations; and delve deeper into LMIC-specific labor market outcomes.</description>

      <title>When Experimental Economics Meets Large Language Models: Evidence-based Tactics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked a growing interest in measuring and understanding their behavior through experimental economics. However, there is still a lack of established guidelines for designing economic experiments for LLMs. Inspired by principles from experimental economics with insights from LLM research in artificial intelligence, we outline key considerations in the experimental design and implementation stage, and perform two sets of experiments to assess the impact of these considerations on LLMs' responses. Based on our findings, we discuss seven practical tactics for conducting experiments with LLMs. Our study enhances the design, replicability, and generalizability of LLM experiments, and broadens the scope of experimental economics in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Lean Startup Method, and Product Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although AI has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We examine how the Lean Startup Method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping focused on developing minimum viable products, and controlled experimentation, focused on rigorous testing such as AB testing. We find that LSM complements discovery oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using AB testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high quality product in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct, as different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of MBSs as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can the general structure of a mortgage-backed security (MBS) contract be programmatically represented through the use of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)? Such an approach could allow for the portfolio of loans to be managed by investors in a trustless and transparent way. The focus and scope of this paper is to explore the potential for applying the tools of modern fintech, such as asset tokenization, smart contracts, and DAOs, to reconstruct traditional structured products that have a greater degree of transparency and traceability. MBS investors face considerable value uncertainty as time increases between the actual occurrence (or non-occurrence) of cash flows and subsequent reporting. Given that an MBS is a financial contract, it should be expressible logically using the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards (ACTUS). Since each underlying mortgage in an MBS derives its cash flows in a prescribed way over the life of the contract, implementation on a public blockchain could enable real-time ratings systems, improving market efficiency. We explore the potential for creating formal algorithmic designs of MBS-DAOs that incorporate individual mortgages, the underlying real estate assets (collateral), and any loan guarantees.</description>

      <title>Gene-environment interplay and public policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This perspective posits that gene-environment interplay (GxE) studies should be developed both theoretically and empirically to be of relevance to policy makers. On the theoretical front, this development is essential because the current literature lacks the integration of a clear framework capturing the various goals of public policies. Empirically, GxE models need to be further developed because the common way of modelling GxE effects fails to adequately capture the heterogeneous effects public policies may have along the distribution of genetic propensities (as captured by polygenic indices). We fill these gaps by proposing a policy classification for GxE research and by offering guidance on advancing the empirical modelling of policy-informative GxE interplay. While doing so, we provide a review of existing GxE studies on educational outcomes exploiting policy reforms or environments that could be targeted by public policy.</description>
