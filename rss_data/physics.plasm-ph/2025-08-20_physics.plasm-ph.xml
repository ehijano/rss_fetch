      <title>Resistive diffusion and radiative cooling effects in magnetized oblique shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized oblique shocks are of interest in various plasmas, including in astrophysical systems, magneto-inertial confinement fusion experiments, and in aerospace applications. Through experiments on the COBRA pulsed power facility (Cornell University, 1~MA peak current, 100~ns rise time), we investigate oblique shock formation in a system with a magnetic field, and where both radiative cooling and resistive diffusion are important. Compared to previous pulsed power experiments, which have investigated quasi-parallel oblique shocks, here we consider perpendicular-type shocks, which can support magnetic field compression. In our experiments, supersonic, super-Alfv\'enic, collisional plasma flows, generated using an aluminum exploding wire array, are deflected by angled obstacles to generate oblique shocks. The shocks are imaged using laser shadowgraphy and Mach-Zehnder interferometry, while optical Thomson scattering provides measurements of the flow velocity and temperature. The shocks exhibit shallower shock angles and higher density compression, when compared to canonical Rankine-Hugoniot predictions. These results are best described by a model that includes both resistive diffusion and radiative cooling, consistent with the values of the cooling parameter and the resistive diffusion length in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Free electron charging of microdroplets in a plasma at atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas phase microdroplets have recently demonstrated exceptional chemical properties via suspected mechanisms such as contact electrification and surface charge pinning leading, in turn, to high electric fields at the surface. In this work, microdroplets are injected into a low temperature flowing gas plasma at atmospheric pressure and during flight they are subject to an excess free electron flux. We report the first measurements of particle charge acquired in a fully collisional plasma with average values up to 2.5E5 electrons, dependent on absorbed power, for droplets with an average diameter of 15 um. Simulations indicate that for similar plasma conditions, the acquired charge on solid particles would be ~40% lower, at 1.5 x 105 electrons, with the difference likely due in part to low mobility water cluster ion formation around the evaporating droplet. Simulation also indicates surface electric fields up to 1E7 V m-1 for the smallest droplets (3 um). The formation of H2O2 was observed in the liquid with measured values up to 33 mM, equivalent to a remarkable generation rate of over 275 M s-1. The microdroplet system involves a complex interplay of various potential mechanisms, yet to be elucidated. The inclusion of a controlled plasma environment offers the capability for creating known charge levels and defined exposure times to allow more systematic study as well as enhancing their already exceptional characteristics.</description>

      <title>Impulsive excitation of a solid by extreme contrast, high intensity femtosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ultra-fast dynamics of the interaction between a high-intensity extreme contrast (expected to be around 1e-18 at hundreds of picoseconds timescale) femtosecond laser and a solid. Simultaneous measurements of probe Doppler spectrometry and reflectivity in pump-probe experiments reveal the presence of extreme pressure in the solid density region, which triggers a long-lived (about 15 ps) strong inward shock. Hydrodynamic simulations accurately replicate these observations, providing a detailed explanation of the underlying physics</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to time-domain Photonic Doppler Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) is an established technique for measuring the velocities of fast-moving surfaces in high-energy-density experiments. In the standard approach to PDV analysis, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to generate a spectrogram from which the velocity history of the target is inferred. The user chooses the form, duration and separation of the window function. Here we present a Bayesian approach to infer the velocity directly from the PDV oscilloscope trace, without using the spectrogram for analysis. This is clearly a difficult inference problem due to the highly-periodic nature of the data, but we find that with carefully chosen prior distributions for the model parameters we can accurately recover the injected velocity from synthetic data. We validate this method using PDV data collected at the STAR two-stage light gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories, recovering shock-front velocities in quartz that are consistent with those inferred using the STFT-based approach, and are interpolated across regions of low signal-to-noise data. Although this method does not rely on the same user choices as the STFT, we caution that it can be prone to misspecification if the chosen model is not sufficient to capture the velocity behavior. Analysis using posterior predictive checks can be used to establish if a better model is required, although more complex models come with additional computational cost, often taking more than several hours to converge when sampling the Bayesian posterior. We therefore recommend it be viewed as a complementary method to that of the STFT-based approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of a RF-RF hybrid plasma torch with argon at atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) extend the equations of incompressible Hall MHD (HMHD) by retaining finite-electron inertia. These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Resonant theory of kinetic ballooning modes in general toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear theory of the kinetic-ballooning-mode (KBM) instability is extended to capture a weakly-driven regime in general toroidal geometry where the destabilization is caused by the magnetic-drift resonance of the ions. Such resonantly-destabilized KBMs are characterized by broad eigenfunctions along the magnetic field line and near-marginal positive growth rates, even well below the beta threshold of their non-resonant counterparts. This unconventional (or sub-threshold) KBM, when destabilized, has been shown to catalyze an enhancement of turbulent transport in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator [1, 2]. Simplifying the energy dependence of key resonant quantities allows for an analytical treatment of this KBM using the physics-based ordering from the more general equations of Tang, Connor, and Hastie [3]. Results are then compared with high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations for the (st)KBM in W7-X and the conventional KBM in a circular tokamak at both high and low magnetic shear, where good agreement is obtained in all cases. This reduced KBM model provides deeper insight into (sub-threshold) KBMs and their relationship with geometry, and shows promise for aiding in transport model development and geometry-based turbulence optimization efforts going forward.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Several investigations show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>
