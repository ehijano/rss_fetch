      <title>Annihilation-limited Long-range Exciton Transport in High-mobility Conjugated Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combination of ultrafast, long-range and low-loss excitation energy transfer from the photo-receptor location to a functionally active site is essential for cost-effective polymeric semiconductors. Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along {\pi}-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact. We complement the pump-probe studies with temperature dependent photocurrent and EEA measurements from 295 K to 77 K and find a remarkable correspondence of annihilation rate and photocurrent activation energies in the 140 K to 295 K temperature range.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Enhancements through rewiring of a non-autonomous delay system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems, such as biological networks, often exhibit intricate rhythmic behaviors that emerge from simple, small-amplitude dynamics in individual components. This study explores how significant oscillatory signals can arise from a minimal system consisting of just two interacting units, each governed by a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation with a recently obtained exact analytical solution. Contrary to the common assumption that large-scale oscillations require numerous units, our model demonstrates that rewiring two units from self-feedback to cross-feedback can generate robust, finite-amplitude oscillations. With time delay, these interacting units produce strongly amplified oscillatory packets compared to self-feedback configurations. Our findings highlight the potential of this minimalistic mechanism for generating complex rhythmic outputs, with implications for oscillatory signal processing and various other applications.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptive learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>
