      <title>Near-critical bipartite configuration models and their associated intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, van der Hofstad, Komj\'{a}thy, and Vadon (2022) identified the critical point for the emergence of a giant connected component for the bipartite configuration model (BCM) and used this to analyze its associated random intersection graph (RIG) (2021). We extend some of this analysis to understand the graph at, and near, criticality. In particular, we show that under certain moment conditions on the empirical degree distributions, the number of vertices in each connected component listed in decreasing order of their size converges, after appropriate re-normalization, to the excursion lengths of a certain thinned L\'{e}vy process. Our approach allows us to obtain the asymptotic triangle counts in the RIG built from the BCM. Our limits agree with the limits recently identified by Wang (2023) for the RIG built from the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph.</description>

      <title>On the randomized Horn problem and the surface tension of hives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\lambda_n$, $\mu_n$, the Horn problem asks for a description of all nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\nu_n$ such that there exist Hermitian matrices $X_n$, $Y_n$ and $Z_n$ respectively with these spectra such that $X_n + Y_n = Z_n$. There is also a randomized version of this problem where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are sampled uniformly at random from orbits of Hermitian matrices arising from the conjugacy action by elements of the unitary group. One then asks for a description of the probability measure of the spectrum of the sum $Z_n$. Both the original Horn problem and its randomized version have solutions using the hives introduced by Knutson and Tao. In an asymptotic sense, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, large deviations for the randomized Horn problem were given by Narayanan and Sheffield in terms of the surface tension of hives. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on this surface tension function. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the total entropy of a surface tension minimizing continuum hive with boundary conditions arising from GUE eigenspectra. Finally, we give several empirical results for random hives and lozenge tilings arising from an application of the octahedron recurrence for large $n$ and a numerical approximation of the surface tension function.</description>

      <title>A distance function for stochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by information geometry, a distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is advocated. Starting with sequences of Markov chains the Bhattacharyya angle is advocated as the natural tool for comparing both short and long term Markov chain runs. Bounds on the convergence of the distance and mixing times are derived. Guided by the desire to compare different Markov chain models, especially in the setting of healthcare processes, a new distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is presented. It is a true distance measure which has a closed form and is efficient to implement for numerical evaluation. In the case of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that considering either the Bhattacharyya angle on Markov sequences or the new stochastic matrix distance leads to the same distance between models.</description>

      <title>Area measures and branched polymers in supercritical Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which has background charge $Q \in (0,2)$ and central charge $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{L}} = 1+6Q^2 \in (1,25)$. Recent works have shown how to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a variant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits "infinite spikes." In contrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest that supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like "branched polymers": i.e., they should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which reconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show that for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class of supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the planar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We also show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with supercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the LQG coordinate change formula. Our proofs are based on a branching process description of supercritical LQG which comes from its coupling with CLE$_4$ (Ang and Gwynne, arXiv:2308.11832).</description>

      <title>Geometry and Duality of Alternating Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize the half-steps of a general class of Markov chains as alternating projections with respect to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sets of joint probability distributions which admit an information geometrical property known as autoparallelism. We exhibit both a weak and strong duality between the Markov chains defined by the even and odd half-steps of the alternating projection scheme, which manifests as an equivalence of entropy decay statement regarding the chains, with a precise characterization of the entropy decrease at each half-step. We apply this duality to several Markov chains of interest, and obtain either new results or short, alternative proofs for mixing bounds on the dual chain, with the Swendsen-Wang dynamics serving as a key example. Additionally, we draw parallels between the half-steps of the relevant Markov chains and the Sinkhorn algorithm from the field of entropically regularized optimal transport, which are unified by the perspective of alternating projections with respect to an \alpha-divergence on the probability simplex.</description>

      <title>The bulk one-arm exponent for the CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) is a conformally invariant random collection of loops. In the non-simple regime $\kappa'\in (4,8)$, it describes the scaling limit of the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolations. CLE percolations were introduced by Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2017). The CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations describe the scaling limit of a natural variant of the FK percolation called the fuzzy Potts model, which has an additional percolation parameter $r$. Based on CLE percolations and assuming that the convergence of the FK percolation to CLE, K{\"o}hler-Schindler and Lehmkuehler (2022) derived all the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model except the bulk one-arm exponent. In this paper, we exactly solve this exponent, which prescribes the dimension of the clusters in CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations. As a special case, the bichromatic one-arm exponent for the critical 3-state Potts model should be $4/135$. To the best of our knowledge, this natural exponent was not predicted in physics. Our derivation relies on the iterative construction of CLE percolations from the boundary conformal loop ensemble (BCLE), and the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and SLE curves. The source of the exact solvability comes from the structure constants of boundary Liouville conformal field theory. A key technical step is to prove a conformal welding result for the target-invariant radial SLE curves. As intermediate steps in our derivation, we obtain several exact results for BCLE in both the simple and non-simple regimes, which extend results of Ang-Sun-Yu-Zhuang (2024) on the touching probability of non-simple CLE. This also provides an alternative derivation of the relation between the BCLE parameter $\rho$ and the additional percolation parameter $r$ in CLE percolations, which was originally due to Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2021, 2022).</description>

      <title>On the valuation of life insurance policies for dependent coupled lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a complex variation of the standard joint life annuity policy by introducing three distinct contingent benefits for the surviving member(s) of a couple, along with a contingent benefit for their beneficiaries if both members pass away. Our objective is to price this innovative insurance policy and analyse its sensitivity to key model parameters, particularly those related to the joint mortality framework. We employ the $QP$-rule (described in Section \ref{secgenset}), which combines the real-world probability measure $P$ for mortality risk with risk-neutral valuation under $Q$ for financial market risks. The model enables explicit pricing expressions, computed using efficient numerical methods. Our results highlight the interdependent risks faced by couples, such as broken-heart syndrome, providing valuable insights for insurers and policyholders regarding the pricing influences of these factors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Nonlinear Model Updating in Structural Dynamics Using a Novel Likelihood Function within the Bayesian-MCMC Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study presents a novel approach for stochastic nonlinear model updating in structural dynamics, employing a Bayesian framework integrated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation by using an approximated likelihood function. The proposed methodology is applied to both numerical and experimental cases. The paper commences by introducing Bayesian inference and its constituents: the likelihood function, prior distribution, and posterior distribution. The resonant decay method is employed to extract backbone curves, which capture the non-linear behaviour of the system. A mathematical model based on a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system is formulated, and backbone curves are obtained from time response data. Subsequently, MCMC sampling is employed to estimate the parameters using both numerical and experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate the convergence of the Markov chain, present parameter trace plots, and provide estimates of posterior distributions of updated parameters along with their uncertainties. Experimental validation is performed on a cantilever beam system equipped with permanent magnets and electromagnets. The proposed methodology demonstrates promising results in estimating parameters of stochastic non-linear dynamical systems. Through the use of the proposed likelihood functions using backbone curves, the probability distributions of both linear and non-linear parameters are simultaneously identified. Based on this view, the necessity to segregate stochastic linear and non-linear model updating is eliminated.</description>

      <title>Improved Anomaly Detection through Conditional Latent Space VAE Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Conditional Latent space Variational Autoencoder (CL-VAE) to perform improved pre-processing for anomaly detection on data with known inlier classes and unknown outlier classes. This proposed variational autoencoder (VAE) improves latent space separation by conditioning on information within the data. The method fits a unique prior distribution to each class in the dataset, effectively expanding the classic prior distribution for VAEs to include a Gaussian mixture model. An ensemble of these VAEs are merged in the latent spaces to form a group consensus that greatly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection across data sets. Our approach is compared against the capabilities of a typical VAE, a CNN, and a PCA, with regards AUC for anomaly detection. The proposed model shows increased accuracy in anomaly detection, achieving an AUC of 97.4% on the MNIST dataset compared to 95.7% for the second best model. In addition, the CL-VAE shows increased benefits from ensembling, a more interpretable latent space, and an increased ability to learn patterns in complex data with limited model sizes.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</description>

      <title>A Class of Degenerate Mean Field Games, Associated FBSDEs and Master Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of degenerate mean field games (MFGs) with state-distribution dependent and unbounded functional diffusion coefficients. With a probabilistic method, we study the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) associated with the MFG and arising from the maximum principle, and estimate the corresponding Jacobian and Hessian flows. We further establish the classical regularity of the value functional $V$; in particular, we show that when the cost function is $C^3$ in the spatial and control variables and $C^2$ in the distribution argument, then the value functional is $C^1$ in time and $C^2$ in the spatial and distribution variables. As a consequence, the value functional $V$ is the unique classical solution of the degenerate MFG master equation. The typical linear-quadratic examples are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple model for the spread of an infection in a structured population. We consider a variant of this process on Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees, where vertices are equipped with a random fitness representing inhomogeneous transmission rates among individuals. In this paper, we establish conditions under which this inhomogeneous contact process exhibits a phase transition. We first prove that if certain mixed moments of the joint offspring and fitness distribution are finite, then the survival threshold is strictly positive. Further, we show that, if slightly different mixed moments are infinite, then this implies that there is no phase transition and the process survives with positive probability for any choice of the infection parameter. A similar dichotomy is known for the contact process on a Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson tree. However, we show that the introduction of fitness means that we have to take into account the combined effect of fitness and offspring distribution to decide which scenario occurs.</description>

Abstract: The present manuscript is devoted to the study of the convergence to equilibrium as the noise intensity $\varepsilon&gt;0$ tends to zero for ergodic random systems out of equilibrium of the type \begin{align*} \mathrm{d} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x) = (\mathfrak{b}-\mathfrak{a} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x))\mathrm{d} t+\varepsilon \sqrt{X^{\varepsilon}_t(x)}\mathrm{d} B_t, \quad X^{\varepsilon}_0(x) = x, \quad t\geqslant 0, \end{align*} where $x\geqslant 0$, $\mathfrak{a}&gt;0$ and $\mathfrak{b}&gt;0$ are constants, and $(B_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ is a one dimensional standard Brownian motion. More precisely, we show the strongest notion of asymptotic profile cut-off phenomenon in the total variation distance and in the renormalized Wasserstein distance when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero with explicit cut-off time, explicit time window, and explicit profile function. In addition, asymptotics of the so-called mixing times are given explicitly.</description>

      <title>Robust Market Convergence: From Discrete to Continuous Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous time financial market models are often motivated as scaling limits of discrete time models. The objective of this paper is to establish such a connection for a robust framework. More specifically, we consider discrete time models that are parameterized by Markovian transition kernels, and a continuous time framework with drift and volatility uncertainty, again parameterized in a Markovian way. Our main result is a limit theory that establishes convergence of the uncertainty sets in the Hausdorff metric topology and weak convergence of the associated worst-case expectations. Furthermore, we discuss a structure preservation property of certain approximations. Namely, we establish the convergence of discrete to continuous time robust superhedging prices for some complete robust market models. As illustration of our main results, we use the idea of Kushner's Markov chain approximation method and provide a recursive algorithm for the computation of continuous time robust superhedging prices.</description>

      <title>Kemeny's constant and the Lemoine point of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant is an invariant of discrete-time Markov chains, equal to the expected number of steps between two states sampled from the stationary distribution. It appears in applications as a concise characterization of the mixing properties of a Markov chain and has many alternative definitions. In this short article, we derive a new geometric expression for Kemeny's constant, which involves the distance between two points in a simplex associated to the Markov chain: the circumcenter and the Lemoine point. Our proof uses an expression due to Wang, Dubbeldam and Van Mieghem of Kemeny's constant in terms of effective resistances and Fiedler's interpretation of effective resistances as edge lengths of a simplex.</description>

      <title>The longest branches in a non-Markovian phylogenetic tree</title>

Abstract: Consider a Bellman--Harris-type branching process, in which individuals evolve independently of one another, giving birth after a random time $T$ to a random number $L$ of children. In this article, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the length of the longest branches of this branching process at time $t$, both pendant branches (corresponding to individuals still alive at time $t$) and interior branches (corresponding to individuals dead before time $t$).</description>

      <title>The stationary distributions of state-dependent diffusions reflected at one and two sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a one-dimensional diffusion process which has state-dependent drift and deviation and is reflected at the origin, which is called a one-side reflected diffusion or simply reflected diffusion. We are particularly interested in the case that its drift and deviation are discontinuous. We define this reflected diffusion as the solution of a stochastic integral equation, and find conditions for its positive recurrence, We then derive its stationary distribution under these conditions. As a related problem, we also consider the case that it is reflected at two sides, which is called a two-sides reflected diffusion. Its existence, positive recurrence and stationary distribution are similarly studied.
  In the literature, these problems are studied through a state-dependent diffusion on the whole line particularly when the drift and deviation are discontinuous. However, the reflected process itself is not defined in such a study. Thus, the stationary distribution has not been fully studied for a general state-dependent reflected diffusion. We aim to fills this insufficiency and to make the stationary distributions of reflected diffusions widely available in application.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling with low-rank Wasserstein polynomial chaos expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Wasserstein multi-element polynomial chaos expansion (WPCE) is proposed, which is inspired by recent advances in computational optimal transport for estimating Wasserstein distances. The developed method combines unsupervised learning with the explicit functional representation of a random vector $Y$. Its training only relies on a finite set of samples from an unknown distribution, which is used to minimize a regularized empirical Wasserstein metric known as debiased Sinkhorn divergence. An interesting application that motivates the approach comes from the numerical upscaling of non-periodic random fields defined on a micro-scale. The WPCE can encode higher order stochastic information about the effective material behavior in contrast to the constant characterization with stochastic homogenization. A striking feature of the new method is the generalization of common diffeomorphic transport maps to the case of discontinuous and non-injective model classes $\mathcal{M}$ with possibly different input and output dimension. It computes a (functional) relation $Y=\mathcal{M}(X)$ in distribution with input random variables $X$ and target $Y$. The exponential growth of the PCE is alleviated by a new stacked tensor train (STT) format. By the choice of the model class $\mathcal{M}$ and the smooth loss function, higher-order optimization schemes and in particular Riemannian descent methods become possible. The proposed approach is illustrated numerically with a high-dimensional upscaling problem, which considers a microscopic random non-periodic composite material. It results in a computationally tractable effective macroscopic random field in adapted stochastic coordinates. By using a relaxation to a discontinuous model class, multimodal distributions also become tractable.</description>

      <title>Repetition and recurrence times: Dual statements and short memory conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By an analogy to the duality between the recurrence time and the longest match length, we introduce a quantity dual to the maximal repetition length, which we call the repetition time. Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The condition for the upper bound resembles short memory in the sense developed in time series analysis. Our reasonings make a repeated use of dualities between so called times and so called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</description>

      <title>Geometry and analytic properties of the sliced Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein metric compares probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by taking averages of the Wasserstein distances between projections of the measures to lines. The distance has found a range of applications in statistics and machine learning, as it is easier to approximate and compute in high dimensions than the Wasserstein distance. While the geometry of the Wasserstein metric is quite well understood, and has led to important advances, very little is known about the geometry and metric properties of the sliced Wasserstein (SW) metric. Here we show that when the measures considered are ``nice'' (e.g. within a positive multiples of the Lebesgue measure) then the SW metric is comparable to the (homogeneous) negative Sobolev norm $\dot H^{-(d+1)/2}$. On the other hand when the measures considered are close in the infinity transportation metric to a discrete measure, then the SW metric between them is close to a multiple of the Wasserstein metric. We characterize the tangent space of the SW space, show that the speed of curves in the space can be described by a quadratic form, but that the SW space is not a length space. We establish a number of properties of the metric given by the minimal length of curves between measures -- the SW length. Finally we highlight the consequences of these properties to the gradient flows in the SW metric.</description>

      <title>On The MCMC Performance In Bernoulli Group Testing And The Random Max Set-Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group testing problem is a canonical inference task where one seeks to identify $k$ infected individuals out of a population of $n$ people, based on the outcomes of $m$ group tests. Of particular interest is the case of Bernoulli group testing (BGT), where each individual participates in each test independently and with a fixed probability. BGT is known to be an "information-theoretically" optimal design, as there exists a decoder that can identify with high probability as $n$ grows the infected individuals using $m^*=\log_2 \binom{n}{k}$ BGT tests, which is the minimum required number of tests among \emph{all} group testing designs.
  An important open question in the field is if a polynomial-time decoder exists for BGT which succeeds also with $m^*$ samples. In a recent paper (Iliopoulos, Zadik COLT '21) some evidence was presented (but no proof) that a simple low-temperature MCMC method could succeed. The evidence was based on a first-moment (or "annealed") analysis of the landscape, as well as simulations that show the MCMC success for $n \approx 1000s$.
  In this work, we prove that, despite the intriguing success in simulations for small $n$, the class of MCMC methods proposed in previous work for BGT with $m^*$ samples takes super-polynomial-in-$n$ time to identify the infected individuals, when $k=n^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ small enough. Towards obtaining our results, we establish the tight max-satisfiability thresholds of the random $k$-set cover problem, a result of potentially independent interest in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems.</description>
