      <title>Dispensing with optimal control: a new approach for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts, overcoming the limitations of traditional optimal control methods, which frequently encounter difficulties with high-dimensional state spaces and the intricacies of selecting appropriate risk penalty or risk aversion parameter. Our methodology applies optimized heuristic strategies to maximize the contract's value. The computation of this value utilizes classical methods typically used for pricing path-dependent Bermudan options. Additionally, our approach naturally leads to the formulation of a hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>An Asymmetric Capital Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing a measure of market risk is an important issue for investors and financial institutions. However, the existing models for this purpose are per definition symmetric. The current paper introduces an asymmetric capital asset pricing model for measurement of the market risk. It explicitly accounts for the fact that falling prices determine the risk for a long position in the risky asset and the rising prices govern the risk for a short position. Thus, a position dependent market risk measure that is provided accords better with reality. The empirical application reveals that Apple stock is more volatile than the market only for the short seller. Surprisingly, the investor that has a long position in this stock is facing a lower volatility than the market. This property is not captured by the standard asset pricing model, which has important implications for the expected returns and hedging designs.</description>

      <title>Pricing of European Calls with the Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate valuation of financial derivatives plays a pivotal role in the finance industry. Although closed formulas for pricing are available for certain models and option types, exemplified by the European Call and Put options in the Black-Scholes Model, the use of either more complex models or more sophisticated options precludes the existence of such formulas, thereby requiring alternative approaches. The Monte Carlo simulation, an alternative approach effective in nearly all scenarios, has already been challenged by quantum computing techniques that leverage Amplitude Estimation. Despite its theoretical promise, this approach currently faces limitations due to the constraints of hardware in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.
  In this study, we introduce and analyze a quantum algorithm for pricing European call options across a broad spectrum of asset models. This method transforms a classical approach, which utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), into a quantum algorithm, leveraging the efficiency of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Furthermore, we compare this novel algorithm with existing quantum algorithms for option pricing.</description>

      <title>Approximating Smiles: A Time Change Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method for analyzing the shape of implied volatility smiles The method is applicable to common semimartingale models, such as jump-diffusion, rough volatility, and infinite activity models. We use a moment-based formula to approximate the at-the-money skew and curvature. Additionally, we explicitly approximate the volatility skew and curvature under a time change framework. We derive characteristics of skewness and curvature and explain their implications for model selection based on the approximation. The accuracy of the short-term approximation results on models is tested via numerical methods and on empirical data. The method is then applied to the calibration problem.</description>
