      <title>Iron Snails: non-equilibrium dynamics and spiral abundance patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are not in a dynamical steady state. They continually undergo perturbations, e.g., from infalling dwarf galaxies and dark-matter substructure. After a dynamical perturbation, stars phase mix towards a new steady state; in so doing they generally form spiral structures, such as spiral density waves in galaxy disks and the Gaia Snail observed in the vertical phase-space density in the solar neighborhood. Structures in phase-space density can be hard to measure accurately, because spatially varying selection effects imprint their own patterns on the density. However, stellar labels such as metallicity, or other element abundances, or stellar masses and ages, can be measured even in the face of complex or unknown spatial selection functions. We show that if the equilibrium galaxy has phase-space gradients in these labels, any perturbation that could raise a spiral wave in the phase-space density will raise a spiral wave in the distribution of labels as well. We work out the relationship between the spiral patterns in the density and in the labels. As an example, we analyze the Gaia Snail and show that its amplitude and dynamical age as derived from elemental abundances (mainly [Mg/Fe]) follow similar patterns to those derived from the phase-space density. Our best model dates the Snail's perturbation to about 400 Myr ago although we find significant variations with angular momentum in the best-fit age. Conceptually, the ideas presented here are related to Orbital Torus Imaging, chemical tagging, and other methods that use stellar labels to trace dynamics.</description>

      <title>Disrupted Wide Binaries as Dynamical Probes of Galactic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the stars in the Galaxy were formed in binary systems. The widest of these can eventually become disrupted due to a combination of kicks from passing stars and the Galactic tidal field. If the Galactic disk were purely axisymmetric, the stars from a disrupted binary system would slowly drift apart on nearly identical orbits. We study how the existence of non-axisymmetric structures, such as a rigidly rotating bar, can greatly alter this picture. In particular, we show how the orbital dynamics near the resonances sourced by these perturbations can create local fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binary separations. We simulate the evolution of wide binary systems embedded in gravitational potentials with rotating galactic bars, and show how features and fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binaries can be used to locate bar resonances and constrain the bar's pattern speed and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than its host halo, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>

      <title>The YMCA (Yes, Magellanic Clouds Again) survey: probing the outer regions of the Magellanic system with VST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are the Milky Way's most massive dwarf satellites. As they also represent the closest pair of galaxies in an ongoing tidal interaction, while simultaneously infalling into the Milky Way halo, they provide a unique opportunity to study in detail an ongoing three-body encounter. We present the ``YMCA (Yes, Magellanic Clouds Again) survey: probing the outer regions of the Magellanic system with VST'' based on deep optical photometry carried out with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST). YMCA targeted 110 square degrees, in the g and i filters, in the periphery of both the MCs, including a long strip in between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The photometry of YMCA is sufficiently deep (50\% complete down to $g \simeq 23.5-24.0$~mag) to allow for a detailed analysis of main-sequence stars in regions of the MCs remained relatively unexplored at these faint magnitudes. The resulting colour-magnitude diagrams reveal that the outskirts of the MCs are predominantly characterized by intermediate-age and old stellar populations, with limited or negligible evidence of recent star formation. The analysis of the age distribution of star clusters (SCs) within the surveyed area, both already known and newly discovered candidates, hints at a close fly-by between the LMC and SMC that occurred $\simeq 2.5-3.0$~Gyr ago, in agreement with previous results. We also report the discovery of candidate SCs with ages within the so-called ``age-gap'', questioning its real existence.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of merger histories in the population of Insitu stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of insitu stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define insitu stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinize correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unraveling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A blazar in the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Here we report multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations of the quasar VLASSJ0410-0139 at redshift z=7, powered by a 7e8 solar-mass black hole. Its radio variability, X-ray properties, and compact radio emission on parsec scales reveal that J0410-0139 is a blazar with a relativistic jet aligned with our line of sight. This blazar's existence implies that many more similar (unaligned) jetted sources must exist at z=7. One scenario is that we observe an intrinsically low-power radio jet, but we see it at high luminosity due to relativistic beaming effects. In this case, a large fraction (&gt;80%) of the UV bright quasars must have a similar jet to match the number density expected from the UV quasar luminosity function. These jets can enhance the growth of supermassive black holes and substantially affect their host galaxies. However, the implications would be even more severe if the quasar belongs to the top 10% radio luminous quasars, as measured if the beaming enhancement is less than a factor of 10-15. In this scenario, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z=7 with intrinsic properties similar to J0410-0139 -- in strong tension with the number density of bright quasars derived from their UV luminosity function. To reconcile these results, most black hole growth at z=7 must happen in an obscured phase, as some models predict. The existence of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization is facilitated by significant jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>The Role of Spiral Arms in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the influence of spiral arms on the star formation activity of disk galaxies by constructing and fitting multi-wavelength SEDs for the two nearby spiral galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 4321, at a spatial scale of 1-1.5kpc scale. Recent results in the literature support the 'gatherers' picture, i.e., that spiral arms gather material but do not trigger star formation. However, ambiguities in the diagnostics used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and other quantities have hampered attempts at reaching definite conclusions. We approach this problem by utilizing the physical parameters output of the MAGPHYS fitting code, which we apply to the Ultraviolet-to-Far Infrared (UV-to-FIR) photometry, in $\geq$20 bands, of spatially-resolved regions in the two galaxies. We separate the regions in arm and interarm, and study the distributions of the specific SFRs (sSFRs=SFR/M$_{star}$), stellar ages and star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$). We find that the distributions of these parameters in the arm regions are almost indistinguishable from those in the interarm regions, with typical differences of a factor 2 or less in the medians. These results support the 'gatherer' scenario of spiral arms, which we plan to test with a larger sample in the near future.</description>

      <title>The [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic Disk: The influence of metallicity and Galactic population in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar ages are an important parameter to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In recent years, several studies have established the existence of a relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a promising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its validity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk populations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock with stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical clock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise stellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y through line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48 metal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS spectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages were estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample, together with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous works, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk for $-$0.71 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic ages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could be clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We found a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio and stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report similar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s) found here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using solar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and 0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the solar-twins till date.</description>

      <title>Coordinated JWST Imaging of Three Distance Indicators in a SN Host Galaxy and an Estimate of the TRGB Color Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boasting a 6.5m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., TRGB or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, JAGB/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected -- with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations -- so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping HST imaging to identify TRGB stars, cross-match them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB's F115W-(F115W}-F444W) relation equal to -0.99 +/- 0.16 mag/mag. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar 2MASS J-band, as well as with predictions from the BASTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the two-dimensional TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.</description>

      <title>The Age-Dependent Vertical Actions of Young Stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk's gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from \textit{Gaia} E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages $\tau$ from LAMOST. We constructed a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits' mean vertical actions $J_z$ as a function of Galactocentric radius, $R_{\mathrm{GC}}$.
  Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital \textit{heating} by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XIV: Free-Free Templates Derived from H$41\alpha$ and Ionized Gas Content in Fifteen Massive Protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the H$41\alpha$ recombination line to create templates of the millimeter free-free emission in the ALMA-IMF continuum maps, which allows to separate it from dust emission. This method complements spectral-index information and extrapolation from centimeter wavelength maps. We use the derived maps to estimate the properties of up to 34 HII regions across the ALMA-IMF protoclusters. The hydrogen ionizing-photon rate $Q_0$ and spectral types follow the evolutionary trend proposed by Motte et al. The youngest protoclusters lack detectable ionized gas, followed by protoclusters with increasing numbers of OB stars. The total $Q_0$ increases from $\sim 10^{45}$ s$^{-1}$ to $&gt; 10^{49}$ s$^{-1}$. We used the adjacent He$41\alpha$ line to measure the relative number abundances of helium, finding values consistent with the Galactic interstellar medium, although a few outliers are discussed. A search for sites of maser amplification of the H$41\alpha$ line returned negative results. We looked for possible correlations between the electron densities ($n_e$), emission measures (EM), and $Q_0$ with HII region size $D$. The latter are the better correlated, with $Q_0 \propto D^{2.49\pm0.18}$. This favors interpretations where smaller ultracompact HII regions are not necessarily the less dynamically evolved versions of larger ones, but rather are ionized by less massive stars. Moderate correlations were found between dynamical width $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ with $D$ and $Q_0$. $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ increases from about one to two times the ionized-gas sound speed. Finally, an outlier HII region south of W43-MM2 is discussed. We suggest that this source could harbor an embedded stellar or disk wind.</description>

      <title>Infrared band strengths of dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm-1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called dangling OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm-1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 plus-minus 1.6 times 10-18 and 9.1 plus-minus 1.0 times 10-18 cm molecule-1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680-3620 cm-1, with a band strength of 1.8 plus-minus 0.1 times 10-17 cm molecule-1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.</description>

      <title>Discovery of HCCCH2CCH in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection in space of 1,4-pentadiyne. It has been found towards TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey in the 31-50 GHz range. We observed a total of 17 transitions with J = 2 up to 13 and Ka = 0, 1 and 2. The observed transitions allowed us to derive a rotational temperature of 9.5 +- 0.5 K and a column density of (5.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2. This molecule was the last non-cyclic isomer of the C5H4 family that could be detected via radio astronomy. A computational chemistry study was performed to determine the energies of the five most stable isomers. The isomer (c-C3H3CCH) has a considerably higher energy than the others, and it has not yet been detected. To better understand the chemical reactions involving these species, we compared the ethynyl and cyano derivatives. The observed abundances of these species are in good agreement with the branching ratios of the formation reactions studied with our chemical model of TMC-1.</description>

      <title>Triangulum IV: A Possible Ultra-Diffuse Satellite of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a dwarf satellite candidate (Triangulum IV: Tri IV) of the Triangulum galaxy (M33) using the deep imaging of Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). From the apparent magnitude of the horizontal branch in Tri IV, the heliocentric distance of Tri IV is estimated to be $932^{+49}_{-43}$ kpc, indicating that Tri IV is located at the distance of $75^{+48}_{-40}$ kpc from the M33 center. This means that Tri IV is the probable satellite of M33, because its distance from M33 is within the virial radius of M33. We also estimate its surface brightness of $\mu_{\it V} = 29.72^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and half-light radius of $r_h = 1749^{+523}_{-425}$ pc, suggesting that Tri IV is an ultra-diffuse galaxy or dynamically heated galaxy. The surface brightness of Tri IV is too low to be detected in the previous survey, so this detection suggests that much fainter satellites may be present in the outskirts of M33.</description>

      <title>The nearest neutral gas phase to Supermassive Black Holes. A massive neutral-atom/molecule-rich Broad Line Region in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Broad Line Regions (BLRs) are regions containing gravitationally-bound gas within r~(few) 10^2-10^3 Schwarszchild radii near Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Photo-ionized by strong non-stellar AGN continuum, this gas emits luminous UV/optical/near-IR lines from ionized Hydrogen (and other multi-ionized atoms) that have the widest velocity profiles observed in galaxies, uniquely indicating the deep gravitational wells of SMBHs. Nearly all BLR studies focus on its ionized gas phase (hereafter BLR+), with typical masses of only a few 10-100 M_Sun, despite strong indications of neutral BLR gas reservoirs (hereafter BLR0) with M_BLR0~10^{5-6} M_Sun. The photoionization code CLOUDY, with its chemistry augmented with three-body reactions, is used to explore 1-D models of dustless BLRs, focusing on the BLR0 conditions, and the abundances of its most prevalent neutral atoms and molecules. A (neutral-atom/molecule)-rich BLR0 gas phase is found underlying the BLR+, the latter occupying only a thin outer layer of AGN-irradiated gas column densities, while the former contains the bulk of the BLR gas mass. Atomic carbon and oxygen and the CO molecule can reach substantial abundances in the BLR0, while their lines at IR/submm wavelengths can yield new probes of the BLR physical conditions and dynamics, unhindered by the dust absorption from outer AGN tori that readily absorb the BLR+ optical/far-UV lines. Neutral-atom-rich and even molecule-rich gas can exist in the BLR0. The corresponding spectral lines from neutral atoms and molecules promise a new spectral window of gas dynamics in the vicinity of~SMBHs unhindered by dust absorption, and may even allow novel tests of General Relativity in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A photo-$z$ cautionary tale: Redshift confirmation of COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling et al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\gtrsim7.0$, favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive DSFG. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in ALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9$\mu$m, and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20$\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona-fide $z_{\rm phot}\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for photo-$z$ robustness. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs of DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XII: Point-process mapping of 15 massive protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial aspect in addressing the challenge of measuring the core mass function, that is pivotal for comprehending the origin of the initial mass function, lies in constraining the temperatures of the cores. We aim to measure the luminosity, mass, column density and dust temperature of star-forming regions imaged by the ALMA-IMF large program. High angular resolution mapping is required to capture the properties of protostellar and pre-stellar cores and to effectively separate them from larger features, such as dusty filaments. We employed the point process mapping (PPMAP) technique, enabling us to perform spectral energy distribution fitting of far-infrared and submillimeter observations across the 15 ALMA-IMF fields, at an unmatched 2.5" angular resolution. By combining the modified blackbody model with near-infrared data, we derived bolometric luminosity maps. We estimated the errors impacting values of each pixel in the temperature, column density, and luminosity maps. Subsequently, we employed the extraction algorithm getsf on the luminosity maps in order to detect luminosity peaks and measure their associated masses. We obtained high-resolution constraints on the luminosity, dust temperature, and mass of protoclusters, that are in agreement with previously reported measurements made at a coarser angular resolution. We find that the luminosity-to-mass ratio correlates with the evolutionary stage of the studied regions, albeit with intra-region variability. We compiled a PPMAP source catalog of 313 luminosity peaks using getsf on the derived bolometric luminosity maps. The PPMAP source catalog provides constraints on the mass and luminosity of protostars and cores, although one source may encompass several objects. Finally, we compare the estimated luminosity-to-mass ratio of PPMAP sources with evolutionary tracks and discuss the limitations imposed by the 2.5" beam.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>

      <title>HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: I. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Draco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze four epochs of HST imaging over 18 years for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We measure precise proper motions (PMs) for hundreds of stars and combine these with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. This provides the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for any dwarf galaxy. These constrain the intrinsic velocity anisotropy and resolve the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. We solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the mass profile. We find the velocity dispersion to be radially anisotropic along the symmetry axis and tangentially anisotropic in the equatorial plane, with a globally-averaged value $\overline{\beta_{\mathrm B}}=-0.20^{+ 0.28}_{- 0.53}$, (where $1 - \beta_{\mathrm B} \equiv \langle v_{\mathrm{ tan}}^2 \rangle / \langle v_{\mathrm{ rad}}^2 \rangle$ in 3D). The logarithmic dark matter (DM) density slope over the observed radial range, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{ dark}}$, is $-0.83^{+ 0.32}_{- 0.37}$, consistent with the inner cusp predicted in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. As expected given Draco's low mass and ancient star formation history, it does not appear to have been dissolved by baryonic processes. We rule out cores larger than 487, 717, 942 pc at respective 1-, 2-, 3-$\sigma$ confidence, thus imposing important constraints on the self-interacting DM cross-section. Spherical models yield biased estimates for both the velocity anisotropy and the inferred slope. The circular velocity at our outermost data point (900 pc) is $24.19^{+ 6.31}_{- 2.97} \ \mathrm{km~s^{-1}}s$. We infer a dynamical distance of $75.37^{+ 4.73}_{- 4.00}$ kpc, and show that Draco has a modest LOS rotation, with $\left&lt;v / \sigma \right&gt; = 0.22 \pm 0.09$. Our results provide a new stringent test of the so-called `cusp-core' problem that can be readily extended to other dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Challenges in modeling the dark matter halo of NGC 1052-DF2: Cored versus cuspy halo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of NGC 1052-DF2 and subsequent modeling have shown that NGC 1052-DF2 is deficient in dark matter and is in conflict with the standard stellar-to-halo mass ratio. In this work, we aim to resolve the degeneracy between the dynamical models on the mass estimate of the NGC 1052-DF2.We constructed mass models of NGC 1052-DF2 using an anisotropic distribution function with a radially varying anisotropy parameter and studied the effect of the various model parameters on the dark matter estimates. We used the observed stellar photometry as an input parameter to construct the distribution function and employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the dark matter model parameters.We find that mass models with a cuspy dark matter halo have comparable $\chi^{2}$ to models with zero dark matter. Moreover, the cuspy dark matter halo fails to consistently account for the observed velocity dispersion in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy. Consequently, we rule out the possibility of a cuspy dark matter halo for describing the mass models of NGC 1052 - DF2. Our study shows that the cored dark matter halo model with a total mass of $\log(M_{DM}/M_{\odot})=10.5$ explains the observed kinematics but requires an extraordinarily large scale length (20kpc) and an outer cutoff radius (26kpc). While the cored mass model provides a comparatively better fit, our findings emphasize that the mass models are largely unconstrained by the available kinematic data. Our results suggest that NGC 1052 - DF2 may not only have an ultra-diffuse stellar distribution but that it can, within uncertainties in the available kinematic data, potentially host an ultra-diffuse dark matter distribution compatible with the standard stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) predicted by galaxy formation and evolution models</description>

      <title>Overview Results of JWST Observations of Star-Forming Clusters in the Extreme Outer Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme outer Galaxy (EOG), which we define as the region of the Milky Way with a galactocentric radius of more than 18 kpc, provides an excellent opportunity to study star formation in an environment significantly different from that in the solar neighborhood because of its lower metallicity and lower gas density. We carried out near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) imaging observations toward two star-forming clusters located in the EOG using JWST NIRCam and MIRI with nine filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F350W, F405N, F444W, F770W, F1280W, and F2100W. In this paper, we present an overview of the observations, data reduction, and initial results. The NIR sensitivity is approximately 10--80 times better than our previous observation with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. Accordingly, the mass detection limit reaches to about 0.01--0.05 $M_\odot$, which is about 10 times better than the previous observations. At MIR wavelengths, the high sensitivity and resolution data enable us to resolve individual young stellar objects in such a distant region for the first time. The mass detection limit at MIR F770W filter reaches about 0.1--0.3 $M_\odot$. With these new observations, we have identified components of the clusters that previous surveys did not detect, including class 0 candidates, outflow/jet components, and distinctive nebular structures. These data will enable us to investigate the properties of star formation in the EOG at the same depth of detail as previous observations of star formation in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>Evidence for large baryonic feedback at low and intermediate redshifts from kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with ACT and DESI photometric galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cosmological observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the distribution of baryons relative to the underlying matter. In this work, we robustly show that the gas is much more extended than the dark matter at 40$\sigma$ and the amount of baryonic feedback at $z \lesssim 1$ strongly disfavors low-feedback models such as that of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG compared with high-feedback models such as that of the original Illustris simulation. This has important implications for bridging the gap between theory and observations and understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, a better grasp of the baryon-dark matter link is critical to future cosmological analyses, which are currently impeded by our limited knowledge of baryonic feedback. Here, we measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), stacked on the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey. This is the first analysis to use photometric redshifts for reconstructing galaxy velocities. Due to the large number of galaxies comprising the DESI imaging survey, this is the highest signal-to-noise stacked kSZ measurement to date: we detect the signal at 13$\sigma$ and find that the gas is more spread out than the dark matter at $\sim$40$\sigma$. Our work opens up the possibility to recalibrate large hydrodynamical simulations using the kSZ effect. In addition, our findings point towards a way of alleviating inconsistencies between weak lensing surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as the `low $S_8$' tension, and shed light on long-standing enigmas in astrophysics such as the `missing baryon' problem.</description>

      <title>Redshifts of candidate host galaxies of four fast X-ray transients using VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are X-ray flares lasting minutes to hours. Multi-wavelength counterparts to these FXTs have been proven hard to find. As a result distance measurements are through indirect methods such as host galaxy identification. The three main models proposed for FXTs; supernova shock breakout emission (SN SBO), binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and tidal dirsuption events (TDEs) of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) disrupting a white dwarf (WD), have a different associated L$_{X, peak}$. Therefore obtaining the distance to FXTs will be a powerful probe to investigate the nature of these FXTs. We use VLT/MUSE observations of a sample of FXTs to report the redshift of between 13 and 22 galaxies per FXT and use these redshifts to calculate the distance, L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. We find L$_{X, peak}&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ if we assume any of the sources with a redshift measurement is the true host galaxy of the corresponding FXT. For XRT 100831 we find a very faint galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a chance alignment probability of 0.04. For XRT 060207 we find a candidate host galaxy at z = 0.939 with a low chance alignment probability. However, we also report the detection of a late-type star within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a similar chance alignment probability. For the remaining FXTs we find no sources within their 3$\sigma$ uncertainty regions. We rule out a SN SBO nature for all FXTs based on L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. For XRT 100831 we conclude the detected galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty position is likely to be the host galaxy of this FXT. From the available information, we are not able to determine if XRT 060207 originated from the galaxy found within 1$\sigma$ of the FXT position or was due to a flare from the late-type star detected within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that would produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>A kinematical study of the launching region of the blueshifted HH 46/47 outflow with SINFONI K-band observations</title>

Abstract: Studying outflows is important as they may significantly contribute to angular momentum removal from the star/disk system, affecting disk evolution and planet formation. To investigate the different outflow components; the collimated jet, wide-angled molecular outflow, and outflow cavity, of the Class I HH 46/47 outflow system. We focus on their kinematics. We present Near Infrared (NIR) K-band integral field observations of the blue-shifted HH 46/47 outflow base obtained using VLT/SINFONI with an angular resolution of 0".81. Our analysis focuses on [Fe II], H2 1-0 S(1), and, Br-gamma emission. We employ a wavelength recalibration technique based on OH telluric lines to probe the kinematics of the wide-angled flow with an accuracy of 1 km/s - 3 km/s. A velocity gradient of 10 km/s transverse to the outflow direction is confirmed in the wide-angled H2 outflow cavity. The H2 cavity peaks at radial velocities of -15 km/s to -30 km/s, and the atomic jet at v = -210 km/s. The outflow exhibits a layered structure; the high-velocity [Fe II] and Br-gamma jet is surrounded by a wide-angled H2 outflow cavity, which is in turn nested within the continuum emission and CO molecular outflow. The continuum emission and H2 outflow cavity are asymmetric with respect to the jet axis. We propose that the origin of the asymmetries and the velocity gradient detected in the wide-angled H2 cavity, is due to a wide-angled outflow or successive jet bowshocks expanding into an inhomogeneous ambient medium, or the presence of a secondary outflow. We eliminate outflow rotation as an exclusive origin of this velocity gradient due to large specific angular momenta values, J(r)= 3000 - 4000 km/s au calculated from 1" to 2" along the outflow. The observations reveal the complexities inherent in outflow systems, and the risk of attributing transverse velocity gradients solely to rotation.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the GG Tau A Disk: Constraints from H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+ High Angular Resolution ALMA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.</description>

      <title>Structure of crystalline water ice formed through neon matrix sublimation under cryogenic and vacuum conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice I has three forms depending on the stacking arrangements of its layers: hexagonal ice Ih, cubic ice Ic, and stacking disordered ice Isd. Below ~60 K, amorphous water becomes metastable, and the formation of any form of ice I is often implicitly precluded. Using a newly developed low-temperature reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique, we show that crystalline ice with cubic stacking sequences (i.e., ice Ic) formed through Ne sublimation from a solid H2O/Ne (1:1000 ratio) matrix at 13 K. The extent of staking disorder (disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences) in the ice formed by Ne matrix sublimation is smaller than that in vapor-deposited ice Isd prepared at 143 K and below the limit of detection of low-temperature RHEED. Dependence of the resulting ice structures on the thickness of the H2O/Ne matrix shows that amorphous water first forms in the early stages of Ne sublimation and the cubic stacking sequence subsequently takes place. As the cubic ice Ic formed here at a much lower temperature (13 K) than previously observed (typically above 78 K), Ne matrix sublimation represents a novel route to the formation of cubic ice Ic under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Dust formation during the interaction of binary stars by common envelope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of the common envelope (CE) interaction between two intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and their low-mass companions. For the first time, formation and growth of dust in the envelope is calculated explicitly. We find that the first dust grains appear as early as $\sim$1-3 yrs after the onset of the CE, and are smaller than grains formed later. As the simulations progress, a high-opacity dusty shell forms, resulting in the CE photosphere being up to an order of magnitude larger than it would be without the inclusion of dust. At the end of the simulations, the total dust yield is $0.0082~M_{\odot}$ ($0.022~M_{\odot}$) for a CE with a $1.7~M_{\odot}$ ($3.7~M_{\odot}$) AGB star. Dust formation does not substantially lead to more mass unbinding or substantially alter the orbital evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of deep learning to localise galactic structures in low surface brightness (LSB) images. LSB imaging reveals many interesting structures, though these are frequently confused with galactic dust contamination, due to a strong local visual similarity. We propose a novel unified approach to multi-class segmentation of galactic structures and of extended amorphous image contaminants. Our panoptic segmentation model combines Mask R-CNN with a contaminant specialised network and utilises an adaptive preprocessing layer to better capture the subtle features of LSB images. Further, a human-in-the-loop training scheme is employed to augment ground truth labels. These different approaches are evaluated in turn, and together greatly improve the detection of both galactic structures and contaminants in LSB images.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation density of SNM.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Boundaries of H2O Maser Emission in an X-ray Illuminated Gas Disk ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High precision mapping of H2O megamaser emission from active galaxies has revealed more than a dozen Keplerian H2O maser disks, which enable a ~4% uncertainty estimate of the Hubble constant as well as providing accurate masses for the central black holes. These disks often have well-defined inner and outer boundaries of maser emission on sub-parsec scales. In order to better understand the physical conditions that determine the inner and outer radii of a maser disk, we examine the distributions of gas density and X-ray heating rate in a warped molecular disk described by a power-law surface density profile. For a suitable choice of the disk mass, we find that the outer radius R_out of the maser disk predicted from our model can match the observed value, with R_out mainly determined by the maximum heating rate or the minimum density for efficient maser action, depending on the combination of the Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and disk mass. Our analysis also indicates that the inner radius for maser action is comparable to the dust sublimation radius, suggesting that dust may play a role in determining the inner radius of a maser disk. Finally, our model predicts that H2O gigamaser disks could exist at the centers of high-z quasars, with disk sizes of &gt;~ 10-30 pc.</description>

Abstract: [abridged] Hot plasma plays a crucial role in regulating the baryon cycle within the Milky Way, flowing from the energetic sources in the Galactic center and disc, to the corona and the halo. This hot plasma represents an important fraction of the Galactic baryons, plays a key role in galactic outflows and is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution models. Taking advantage of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG))/eROSITA first all-sky survey (eRASS1), in this work, we aim to provide a panoramic view of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Here we present the eROSITA eRASS1 half sky maps in narrow energy bands corresponding to the most prominent soft X-ray lines: OVII and OVIII, which allow us to constrain the distribution of the hot plasma within and surrounding the Milky Way. We corrected the maps by removing the expected contribution associated with the cosmic X-ray background, the time-variable solar wind charge exchange, and the local hot bubble. We applied corrections to mitigate the effect of absorption, therefore highlighting the emission from the CGM of the Milky Way. We use the line ratio of the oxygen lines as a proxy to constrain the temperature of the warm-hot CGM, and we define a pseudo-temperature $\mathcal{T}$ map. The map highlights how different regions are dominated by different thermal components. Towards the outer halo, the temperature distribution of the CGM on angular scales of 2-20 deg is consistent with being constant $\Delta \mathcal{T} / \langle \mathcal{T}\rangle \leq 4\%$, with a marginal detection of $\Delta \mathcal{T} / \langle \mathcal{T}\rangle = 2.7 \% \pm 0.2\%$ (statistical) $\pm 0.6\%$ (systematic) in the southern hemisphere. Instead, significant variations $\sim 12\%$ are observed on many tens of degrees scales when comparing the northern and southern hemispheres.</description>

      <title>FRESCO: The Paschen-$\alpha$ Star Forming Sequence at Cosmic Noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey (FRESCO) on the star forming sequence of galaxies at $1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7$, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, nearly dust-insensitive Paschen-$\alpha$ emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 $\mu$m; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with $M*&gt;9.5 M_\odot$ that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference log(SFR(Pa$\alpha$)-SFR(Prospector)) is -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex at $10^{10-11} M_\odot$. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-$\alpha$ luminosity and rest-frame H band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR-M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources -- that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent -- with significant, typically extended, Paschen-$\alpha$ emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the star forming sequence with careful selection of star forming galaxies and independent star formation rate and stellar mass indicators.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of Gaia BH3 in the progenitor globular cluster of the ED-2 stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary known as Gaia BH3, discovered by the Gaia Collaboration is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo.
  Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream.
  Methods. We used a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii.
  Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\lesssim10^5M_\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of ~4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~75% of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC, all in the early phases of evolution ($\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to streams. The ~25% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\lesssim1\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\gtrsim30M_\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities.
  Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.</description>

Abstract: We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq 3.5$ using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances ($Z_{\mathrm{g}}$; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances ($Z_{\star}$; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range $8.5 &lt; \mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) &lt; 10.5$ and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.30\pm0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.32\pm0.09}$. At fixed $M_{\star}$ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e., $\alpha$-enhancement).We estimate an average enhancement of $\mathrm{(O/Fe)} = 2.65 \pm 0.16 \times \mathrm{(O/Fe)_\odot}$ which appears to be independent of $M_{\star}$. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor ($\eta$). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star}^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of $\alpha$-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which $\alpha$-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>On the contribution of dwarf galaxies to reionization of the Universe</title>

Abstract: We present estimates of the ultraviolet (UV) and Lyman continuum flux density contributed by galaxies of luminosities from $M_{\rm UV}\approx -25$ to $M_{\rm UV}=-4$ at redshifts $5\leq z\leq 10$ using a galaxy formation model that reproduces properties of local dwarf galaxies down to the luminosities of the ultra-faint satellites. We characterize the UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies and their abundance as a function of the ionizing photon emission rate predicted by our model and present accurate fitting functions describing them. Although the slope of the LF becomes gradually shallower with decreasing luminosity due to feedback-driven outflows, the UV LF predicted by the model remains quite steep at the luminosities $M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -14$. After reionization, the UV LF flattens at $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -12$ due to UV heating of intergalactic gas. However, before reionization, the slope of the LF remains steep and approximately constant from $M_{\rm UV}\approx -14$ to $M_{\rm UV}=-4$. We show that for a constant ionizing photon escape fraction the contribution of faint galaxies with $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-14$ to the UV flux and ionizing photon budget is $\approx 40-60\%$ at $z&gt;7$ and decreases to $\approx 20\%$ at $z=6$. Before reionization, even ultra-faint galaxies of $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-10$ contribute $\approx 10-25\%$ of ionizing photons. If the escape fraction increases strongly for fainter galaxies, the contribution of $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-14$ galaxies before reionization increases to $\approx 60-75\%$. Our results imply that dwarf galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-14$, beyond the James Webb Space Telescope limit, contribute significantly to the UV flux density and ionizing photon budget before reionization alleviating requirements on the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons.</description>

      <title>Why does the Milky Way have a metallicity floor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of light element enhancement in the most metal-poor stars is potentially an indication that the Milky Way has a metallicity floor for star formation around $\sim$10$^{-3.5}$ Z$_{\odot}$. We propose that this metallicity floor has its origins in metal-enriched star formation in the minihalos present during the Galaxy's initial formation. To arrive at this conclusion, we analyze a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the concurrent evolution of multiple Population III star-forming minihalos. The main driver for the central gas within minihalos is the steady increase in hydrostatic pressure as the halos grow. We incorporate this insight into a hybrid one-zone model that switches between pressure-confined and modified free-fall modes to evolve the gas density with time according to the ratio of the free-fall and sound-crossing timescales. This model is able to accurately reproduce the density and chemo-thermal evolution of the gas in each of the simulated minihalos up to the point of runaway collapse. We then use this model to investigate how the gas responds to the absence of H$_{2}$. Without metals, the central gas becomes increasingly stable against collapse as it grows to the atomic cooling limit. When metals are present in the halo at a level of $\sim$10$^{-3.7}$ Z$_{\odot}$, however, the gas is able to achieve gravitational instability while still in the minihalo regime. Thus, we conclude that the Galaxy's metallicity floor is set by the balance within minihalos of gas-phase metal cooling and the radiation background associated with its early formation environment.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>

Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 1: MACHOs and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place limits on dark matter made up of compact objects significantly heavier than a solar mass, such as MACHOs or primordial black holes (PBHs). In galaxies, the gas of such objects is generally hotter than the gas of stars and will thus heat the gas of stars even through purely gravitational interactions. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) maximize this effect. Observations of the half-light radius in UFDs thus place limits on MACHO dark matter. We build upon previous constraints with an improved heating rate calculation including both direct and tidal heating, and consideration of the heavier mass range above $10^4 \, M_\odot$. Additionally we find that MACHOs may lose energy and migrate in to the center of the UFD, increasing the heat transfer to the stars. UFDs can constrain MACHO dark matter with masses between about $10 M_\odot$ and $10^8 M_\odot$ and these are the strongest constraints over most of this range.</description>

      <title>A review on the Vortex and Coherent Structures in Dusty Plasma Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is an admixture of electrons, ions, and massive charged solid particles of sub-micron to micron-sized in the background of neutral gas. The dust grain medium exhibits fluid (liquid) as well as solid-like characteristics at different background plasma conditions. It supports various linear and non-linear dynamical structures because of the external perturbation and internal instabilities. The vortical or coherent structure in the dusty plasma medium is a kind of self-sustained dynamical structure that is formed either by instabilities or external forcing. In this review article, the author discusses the past theoretical, experimental, and computational investigations on vortical and coherent structures in unmagnetized as well as in magnetized dusty plasma. The possible mechanisms to form vortices in dust grain medium are discussed in detail. The studies on the evolution of vortices and their correlation with turbulence are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an outflowing Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>
