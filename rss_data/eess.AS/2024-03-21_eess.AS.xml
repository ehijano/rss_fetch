      <title>AdaProj: Adaptively Scaled Angular Margin Subspace Projections for Anomalous Sound Detection with Auxiliary Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function is presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers, AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces. By doing so, the resulting distributions of embeddings belonging to normal data are not required to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 datasets, it is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly outperforms other commonly used loss functions and results in a state-of-the-art performance on the DCASE2023 dataset.</description>

      <title>CATSE: A Context-Aware Framework for Causal Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target Sound Extraction (TSE) focuses on the problem of separating sources of interest, indicated by a user's cue, from the input mixture. Most existing solutions operate in an offline fashion and are not suited to the low-latency causal processing constraints imposed by applications in live-streamed content such as augmented hearing. We introduce a family of context-aware low-latency causal TSE models suitable for real-time processing. First, we explore the utility of context by providing the TSE model with oracle information about what sound classes make up the input mixture, where the objective of the model is to extract one or more sources of interest indicated by the user. Since the practical applications of oracle models are limited due to their assumptions, we introduce a composite multi-task training objective involving separation and classification losses. Our evaluation involving single- and multi-source extraction shows the benefit of using context information in the model either by means of providing full context or via the proposed multi-task training loss without the need for full context information. Specifically, we show that our proposed model outperforms size- and latency-matched Waveformer, a state-of-the-art model for real-time TSE.</description>

      <title>Speech-Aware Neural Diarization with Encoder-Decoder Attractor Guided by Attention Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization with Encoder-Decoder based Attractor (EEND-EDA) is an end-to-end neural model for automatic speaker segmentation and labeling. It achieves the capability to handle flexible number of speakers by estimating the number of attractors. EEND-EDA, however, struggles to accurately capture local speaker dynamics. This work proposes an auxiliary loss that aims to guide the Transformer encoders at the lower layer of EEND-EDA model to enhance the effect of self-attention modules using speaker activity information. The results evaluated on public dataset Mini LibriSpeech, demonstrates the effectiveness of the work, reducing Diarization Error Rate from 30.95% to 28.17%. We will release the source code on GitHub to allow further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>The NeurIPS 2023 Machine Learning for Audio Workshop: Affective Audio Benchmarks and Novel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NeurIPS 2023 Machine Learning for Audio Workshop brings together machine learning (ML) experts from various audio domains. There are several valuable audio-driven ML tasks, from speech emotion recognition to audio event detection, but the community is sparse compared to other ML areas, e.g., computer vision or natural language processing. A major limitation with audio is the available data; with audio being a time-dependent modality, high-quality data collection is time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for academic groups to apply their often state-of-the-art strategies to a larger, more generalizable dataset. In this short white paper, to encourage researchers with limited access to large-datasets, the organizers first outline several open-source datasets that are available to the community, and for the duration of the workshop are making several propriety datasets available. Namely, three vocal datasets, Hume-Prosody, Hume-VocalBurst, an acted emotional speech dataset Modulate-Sonata, and an in-game streamer dataset Modulate-Stream. We outline the current baselines on these datasets but encourage researchers from across audio to utilize them outside of the initial baseline tasks.</description>

      <title>emoDARTS: Joint Optimisation of CNN &amp; Sequential Neural Network Architectures for Superior Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance.
  While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.</description>

      <title>XLAVS-R: Cross-Lingual Audio-Visual Speech Representation Learning for Noise-Robust Speech Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition and translation systems perform poorly on noisy inputs, which are frequent in realistic environments. Augmenting these systems with visual signals has the potential to improve robustness to noise. However, audio-visual (AV) data is only available in limited amounts and for fewer languages than audio-only resources. To address this gap, we present XLAVS-R, a cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model for noise-robust speech recognition and translation in over 100 languages. It is designed to maximize the benefits of limited multilingual AV pre-training data, by building on top of audio-only multilingual pre-training and simplifying existing pre-training schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks, where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7 BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability with audio-only fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Approach to Device-Directed Speech Detection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions with virtual assistants typically start with a predefined trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.</description>

      <title>Gammatonegram Representation for End-to-End Dysarthric Speech Processing Tasks: Speech Recognition, Speaker Identification, and Intelligibility Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dysarthria is a disability that causes a disturbance in the human speech system and reduces the quality and intelligibility of a person's speech. Because of this effect, the normal speech processing systems can not work properly on impaired speech. This disability is usually associated with physical disabilities. Therefore, designing a system that can perform some tasks by receiving voice commands in the smart home can be a significant achievement. In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for the convolutional neural network. On the other word, we convert each speech file into an image and propose image recognition system to classify speech in different scenarios. Proposed CNN is based on the transfer learning method on the pre-trained Alexnet. In this research, the efficiency of the proposed system for speech recognition, speaker identification, and intelligibility assessment is evaluated. According to the results on the UA dataset, the proposed speech recognition system achieved 91.29% accuracy in speaker-dependent mode, the speaker identification system acquired 87.74% accuracy in text-dependent mode, and the intelligibility assessment system achieved 96.47% accuracy in two-class mode. Finally, we propose a multi-network speech recognition system that works fully automatically. This system is located in a cascade arrangement with the two-class intelligibility assessment system, and the output of this system activates each one of the speech recognition networks. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 92.3% WRR. The source code of this paper is available.</description>

      <title>RoDia: A New Dataset for Romanian Dialect Identification from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RoDia, the first dataset for Romanian dialect identification from speech. The RoDia dataset includes a varied compilation of speech samples from five distinct regions of Romania, covering both urban and rural environments, totaling 2 hours of manually annotated speech data. Along with our dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. The top scoring model achieves a macro F1 score of 59.83% and a micro F1 score of 62.08%, indicating that the task is challenging. We thus believe that RoDia is a valuable resource that will stimulate research aiming to address the challenges of Romanian dialect identification. We release our dataset at https://github.com/codrut2/RoDia.</description>

      <title>RTFS-Net: Recurrent Time-Frequency Modelling for Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Multi-Task Fusion for Emotional Mimicry Prediciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a methodology for the Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation task within the context of the 6th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Our approach leverages the Wav2Vec 2.0 framework, pre-trained on a comprehensive podcast dataset, to extract a broad range of audio features encompassing both linguistic and paralinguistic elements. We enhance feature representation through a fusion technique that integrates individual features with a global mean vector, introducing global contextual insights into our analysis. Additionally, we incorporate a pre-trained valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module from the Wav2Vec 2.0 model. Our fusion employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for efficient temporal analysis of audio data. Utilizing only the provided audio data, our approach demonstrates significant improvements over the established baseline.</description>
