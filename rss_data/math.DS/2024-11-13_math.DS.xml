      <title>Variational Estimates for Bilinear Ergodic Averages Along Sublinear Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove long variational estimates for the bilinear ergodic averages \[ A_{N;X}(f,g)(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(T^{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor}x) g(T^nx) \] on an arbitrary measure preserving system $(X,\mu,T)$ for the full expected range, i.e. whenever $f \in L^{p_1}(X)$ and $g \in L^{p_2}(X)$ with $1&lt;p_1,p_2&lt;\infty$. In particular, if $\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}$ we show that the long $r$-variation of $A_{N;X}$ maps $L^{p_1}(X) \times L^{p_2}(X)$ into $L^p(X)$ for any $p&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, which is sharp up to the endpoint. If $p \geq 1$ we obtain long variational estimates for the full expected range $r&gt;2$ and if $p&lt;1$ we obtain a range of $r&gt;2+\varepsilon_{p_1,p_2}$ where $\varepsilon_{p_1,p_2}&gt;0$ depends only on $p_1$ and $p_2$. As a consequence, we obtain bilinear maximal estimates \[ \left\| \sup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} |A_{N;X}(f,g)| \right\|_{L^p(X)} \leq C_{p_1,p_2} \|f\|_{L^{p_1}(X)} \|g\|_{L^{p_2}(X)} \] for any $1&lt;p_1,p_2 \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Convergence of Ergodic Averages Along Hardy Field Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mu)$ be an arbitrary measure space equipped with a family of pairwise commuting measure preserving transformations $T_1, \dotsc, T_m$. We prove that the ergodic averages \[ A_{N;X}^{P_1, \dotsc, P_m}f = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N T_1^{\lfloor P_1(n) \rfloor} \dotsm T_m^{\lfloor P_m(n) \rfloor} f \] converge pointwise $\mu$-almost everywhere as $N \to \infty$ for any $f \in L^p(X)$ with $p&gt;1$, where $P_1, \dotsc, P_m$ are Hardy field functions which are "non-polynomial" and have distinct growth rates. To establish pointwise convergence we will prove a long-variational inequality, which will in turn prove that a maximal inequality holds for our averages.
  Additionally, by restricting the class of Hardy field functions to those with the same growth rate as $t^c$ for $c&gt;0$ non-integer, we also prove full variational estimates. We are therefore able to provide quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence of exponential sums of the form \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N e(\xi_1 \lfloor n^{c_1} \rfloor + \dotsb + \lfloor n^{c_m} \rfloor) \] where $0&lt;c_1&lt;\dotsb&lt;c_m$ are non-integer.</description>

      <title>Distribution of integers with digit restrictions via Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new technique to study the distribution in residue classes of sets of integers with digit and sum-of-digits restrictions. From our main theorem, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for integers with missing digits to be uniformly distributed in arithmetic progressions, extending previous results going back to work of Erd\H{o}s, Mauduit and S\'ark\"ozy. Our approach utilizes Markov chains and does not rely on Fourier analysis as many results of this nature do. Our results apply more generally to the class of multiplicatively invariant sets of integers. This class, defined by Glasscock, Moreira and Richter using symbolic dynamics, is an integer analogue to fractal sets and includes all missing digits sets. We address uniform distribution in this setting, partially answering an open question posed by the same authors.</description>

      <title>Planar vector fields in the kernel of a 1--form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify, up to a natural equivalence relation, vector fields of the plane which belong to the kernel of a 1--form. This form can be closed, in which case the vector fields are integrable, or not, in which case the differential of the form defines a, possibly singular, symplectic form. In every case, we provide a fairly complete list of local models for such fields and construct their transversal unfoldings. Thus, the local bifurcations of vector fields of interest can be studied, among them being the integrable fields of the plane.</description>

      <title>Population growth on a time varying network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population spreading across a finite number of sites. Individuals can move from one site to the other according to a network (oriented links between the sites) that vary periodically over time. On each site, the population experiences a growth rate which is also periodically time varying. Recently, this kind of models have been extensively studied, using various technical tools to derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system (ie the local growth rate on each site, the time period and the strength of migration between the sites) for the population to grow. In the present paper, we take a completely different approach: using elementary comparison results between linear systems, we give sufficient condition for the growth of the population This condition is easy to check and can be applied in a broad class of examples. In particular, in the case when all sites are sinks (ie, in the absence of migration, the population become extinct in each site), we prove that when our condition of growth if satisfied, the population grows when the time period is large and for values of the migration strength that are exponentially small with respect to the time period, which answers positively to a conjecture stated by Katriel.</description>

      <title>On Kite Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study kite central configurations in the Newtonian four-body problem. We present a new proof that there exists a unique convex kite central configuration for a given choice of positive masses and a particular ordering of the bodies. Our proof uses tools from differential topology (e.g., the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf Index Theorem) and computational algebraic geometry (e.g., Gr\"{o}bner bases). We also discuss concave kite central configurations, including degenerate examples and bifurcations. Finally, we numerically explore the linear stability of the corresponding kite relative equilibria, finding that the heaviest body must be at least 25 times larger than the combined masses of the other three bodies in order to be linearly stable.</description>

      <title>On the FOD/FOM parameter of rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a (right) action of ${\rm PSL}_{2}({\mathbb L})$ on the space ${\mathbb L}(z)$ of rational maps defined over an algebraically closed field ${\mathbb L}$. If $R \in {\mathbb L}(z)$ and ${\mathcal M}_{R}^{\chi}$ is its $\chi$-field of moduli, then the parameter ${\rm FOD/FOM}_{\chi}(R)$ is the smallest integer $n \geq 1$ such that there is a $\chi$-field of definition of $R$ being a degree $n$ extension of ${\mathcal M}_{R}^{\chi}$. When ${\mathbb L}$ has characteristic zero and $\chi=\chi_{\infty}$ is the conjugation action, then it is known that ${\rm FOD/FOM}_{\chi_{\infty}}(R) \leq 2$. In this paper, we study the above parameter for general actions and any characteristic.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and global analysis of a systematically reduced plant model in dryland environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into a systematically reduced plant system proposed by Ja\"ibi et al. [Phys. D, 2020] in arid area. They used the method of geometric singular perturbation to study the existence of abundant orbits. Instead, we deliberate the stability and distributed patterns of this system. For a non-diffusive scenario for the model, we scrutinize the local and global stability of equilibria and derive conditions for the existence or non-existence of the limit cycle. The bifurcation behaviors are also explored. For the spatial model, we investigate Hopf, Turing, Hopf-Turing, Turing-Turing bifurcations. Specially, the evolution process from periodic solutions to spatially nonconstant steady states is observed near the Hopf-Turing bifurcation point. And mixed nonconstant steady states near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point are observed. Furthermore, it's found that there exist gap, spot, stripe and mixed patterns. The seed-dispersal rate enables the transformation of pattern structures. Reasonable control of system parameters may prevent desertification from occurring.</description>

      <title>Firing Rate Models as Associative Memory: Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance for Robust Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>On the absence of quantitatively critical measure equivalence couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. These bounds are optimal in many cases but the integrability of the cocycles with respect to these critical thresholds remained unclear. For instance, a cocycle from $\mathbb{Z}^{k+\ell}$ to $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$ can be $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all $p&lt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ but not for $p&gt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$, and the case $p=\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ was an open question which we answer by the negative. Our main result actually yields much more examples where the integrability threshold given by Delabie-Koivisto-Le Ma\^itre-Tessera Theorems cannot be reached.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation of log-affine models using detailed-balanced reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of joint co-tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An old theorem of Newman asserts that any tiling of $\mathbb{Z}$ by a finite set is periodic. A few years ago, Bhattacharya proved the periodic tiling conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Namely, he proved that for a finite subset $F$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, if there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $F \oplus A = \mathbb{Z}^2$ then there exists a periodic $A' \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $F \oplus A' = \mathbb{Z}^2$. The recent refutation of the periodic tiling conjecture in high dimensions due to Greenfeld and Tao motivates finding different generalizations of Newman's theorem and of Bhattacharya's theorem that hold in arbitrary dimension $d$. In this paper, we formulate and prove such generalizations. We do so by studying the structure of joint co-tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our generalization of Newman's theorem states that for any $d \ge 1$, any joint co-tile for $d$ independent tiles is periodic. For a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy a certain technical condition that we call property $(\star)$, we prove that any joint co-tile decomposes into disjoint $(d-1)$-periodic sets. Consequently, we show that for a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy property $(\star)$, the existence of a joint co-tile implies the existence of periodic joint co-tile. Conversely, we prove that if a finite subset $F$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ admits a periodic co-tile $A$, then there exist $(d-1)$ additional tiles that together with $F$ are independent and admit $A$ as a joint co-tile, so that the first $(d-2)$ of these tiles together with $F$ satisfy property $(\star)$. Combined, our results give a new necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to tile periodically. We also discuss tilings and joint tilings in other countable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Deformational spectral rigidity of axially-symmetric symplectic billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symplectic billiards were introduced by Albers and Tabachnikov as billiards in strictly convex bounded domains of the plane with smooth boundary having a specific law of reflection. This paper proves a rigidity result for symplectic billiards which is similar to a previous result on classical billiards formulated by De Simoi, Kaloshin and Wei. Namely, it states that close to an ellipse, a sufficiently smooth one-parameter family of axially symmetric domains either contains domains with different area-spectra or is trivial, in a sense that the domains differ by area-preserving affine transformations of the plane. The paper also prove that in the general setting - that is even if the domains are not close to an ellipse - any sufficiently smooth one-parameter family of axially symmetric domains which preserves the area-spectrum is tangent to a finite dimensionnal space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the entire function $f(z)=\cosh(z)$. We show that the escaping set of this function - that is, the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity under iteration - has a structure known as a "spider's web". This disproves a conjecture of Sixsmith from 2020. In fact, we show that the "fast escaping set", i.e. the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity at an iterated exponential rate, is a spider's web. This answers a question of Rippon and Stallard from 2012. We also discuss a wider class of functions to which our results apply, and state some open questions.</description>

      <title>Multiple mixing, 75 years of Rokhlin's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1949, V.A. Rokhlin introduced new invariants for measure-preserving transformations, called k-fold mixing. Does mixing imply k-fold mixing? -- this problem remains open. We recall shortly some results and discuss related problems.</description>

      <title>Topological entropy of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms: a persistence homology and Floer theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological entropy of compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms from a perspective of persistence homology and Floer theory. We introduce barcode entropy, a Floer-theoretic invariant of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, measuring exponential growth under iterations of the number of not-too-short bars in the barcode of the Floer complex. We prove that the barcode entropy is bounded from above by the topological entropy and, conversely, that the barcode entropy is bounded from below by the topological entropy of any hyperbolic invariant set, e.g., a hyperbolic horseshoe. As a consequence, we conclude that for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of surfaces the barcode entropy is equal to the topological entropy.</description>

      <title>On asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for Navier-Stokes equations on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies some bounded conditions on curvature tensors. First, we use the $L^p-L^q$-dipsersive and smoothing estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the previous ones \cite{Xuan2022,Xuan2023} to the generalized non-compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weak Diffusive Stability of Roll Solutions at the Zigzag Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roll solutions at the zigzag boundary, typically selected by patterns and defects in numerical simulations, are shown to be nonlinearly stable. This result also serves as an example that linear decay weaker than the classical diffusive decay, together with quadratic nonlinearity, still gives nonlinear stability of spatially periodic patterns. Linear analysis reveals that, instead of the classical $t^{-1}$ diffusive decay rate, small perturbations of roll solutions at the zigzag boundary decay with a $t^{-3/4}$ rate along with time, due to the degeneracy of the quadratic term of the continuation of the translational mode of the linearized operator in the Bloch-Fourier spaces. The nonlinear stability proof is based on a decomposition of the neutral translational mode and the faster decaying modes in the Bloch-Fourier space, and a fixed-point argument, demonstrating the irrelevancy of the nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the Kuramoto model with external forcing and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is an important phenomenon in a wide variety of systems comprising interacting oscillatory units, whether natural (like neurons, biochemical reactions, cardiac cells) or artificial (like metronomes, power grids, Josephson junctions). The Kuramoto model provides a simple description of these systems and has been useful in their mathematical exploration. Here we investigate this model combining two common features that have been observed in many systems: external periodic forcing and higher-order interactions among the elements. We show that the combination of these ingredients leads to a very rich bifurcation scenario that produces 11 different asymptotic states of the system, with competition between forced and spontaneous synchronization. We found, in particular, that saddle-node, Hopf and homoclinic manifolds are duplicated in regions of parameter space where the unforced system displays bi-stability.</description>

      <title>The number of periodic points of surface symplectic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use symplectic tools to establish a smooth variant of Franks theorem for a closed orientable surface of positive genus $g$; it implies that a symplectic diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity with more than $2g-2$ fixed points, counted homologically, has infinitely many periodic points. Furthermore, we present examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms with a prescribed number of periodic points. In particular, we construct symplectic flows on surfaces possessing only one fixed point and no other periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of a Zariski dense discrete non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the associated quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. In fact, let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold with properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane for $n\ge 3$. We prove that there exists a non-empty open subset $\cal O$ of $\rm{Hom}(\Gamma, \rm{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the image $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$. Moreover the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal, that is, it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators of all non-lattice discrete subgroups given by property $(T)$ of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$.</description>
