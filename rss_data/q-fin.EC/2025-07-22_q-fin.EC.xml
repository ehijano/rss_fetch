      <title>The Electoral Consequences of Natural Disasters: A Dynamic Fixed-Effects Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency of major natural disasters, understanding their political consequences is of paramount importance for democratic accountability. The existing literature is deeply divided, with some studies finding that voters punish incumbents for disaster-related damages, while others find they reward them for relief efforts. This paper investigates the electoral consequences of natural disasters for incumbent mayors, broader electoral dynamics, and the long-term political ambition of officeholders. The study leverages a comprehensive panel dataset of over 10,000 candidate-election observations in U.S. mayoral races from 1989 to 2021, combining detailed election data with a global registry of disaster events. To identify causal effects, the analysis employs a robust dynamic two-way fixed-effects event-study design, validated by extensive pre-trend and placebo tests. The findings reveal that the electoral impact of disasters is highly conditional on their timing. A disaster that strikes in the same quarter as an election provides a significant electoral boost to incumbents, increasing their vote share by over 6 percentage points. However, disasters consistently suppress voter turnout, reducing it by an average of 1.4 percentage points. In a novel finding, the analysis demonstrates that the experience of managing a disaster significantly increases an incumbent's likelihood of seeking re-election in the subsequent cycle by as much as 12 percentage points. These findings help reconcile conflicting theories of retrospective voting by highlighting the critical role of voter myopia and salience. They also reveal a previously undocumented channel through which crises shape political careers, suggesting that disaster management is not only a test of governance but also a catalyst for political ambition.

      <title>The effects of temperature and rainfall anomalies on Mexican inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper measures the effects of temperature and precipitation shocks on Mexican inflation using a regional panel. To measure the long-term inflationary effects of climate shocks, we estimate a panel autoregressive distributed lag model (panel ARDL) of the quarterly variation of the price index against the population-weighted temperature and precipitation deviations from their historical norm, computed using the 30-year moving average. In addition, we measure the short-term effects of climate shocks by estimating impulse response functions using panel local projections. The result indicates that, in the short term, the climate variables have no statistical effect on Mexican inflation. However, in the long term, only precipitation norms have a statistical effect, and the temperature norms have no statistical impact. Higher than normal precipitation has a positive and statistically significant effect on Mexican inflation for all items.</description>

      <title>Does Private Equity Hurt or Improve Healthcare Value? New Evidence and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the impact of private equity (PE) investment on healthcare value? Does PE investment hurt or improve healthcare value, and if so, can its effect be mitigated through the use of health information technologies (IT)? Given the significant investments by PE firms in the healthcare sector in recent years, these are important research questions. Stakeholders, including policy makers, care providers, and patients, need to understand their likely impact and whether PE ownership is aligned with their interests. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach and data from US hospitals from 2008-2020, we observe that the overall value of healthcare delivered by hospitals declines after PE investment. However, our empirical evidence reveals that IT-enabled, health information sharing plays an important moderating role. Hospitals with stronger information-sharing capabilities exhibit greater cost efficiencies and improvements in care quality, leading to higher healthcare value after PE investment. Furthermore, we find that the type of health information sharing matters. Specifically, we observe that improvements in care quality are primarily driven by information sharing between hospitals and ambulatory care providers, instead of simply hospital-to-hospital sharing of patient health data. Our research also identifies the underlying mechanisms through which health information sharing improves care value by reducing hospital-acquired infections and readmission rates, thereby improving care quality, and enhancing labor productivity by reducing operating costs. Our results highlight the critical role of policies and common data standards needed to promote IT-enabled information sharing between healthcare providers, which, in turn, can align incentives of PE firms with the goals of value-based care.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Financial Frictions in Agriculture: A Framework for Stablecoin Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent financial frictions - including price volatility, constrained credit access, and supply chain inefficiencies - have long hindered productivity and welfare in the global agricultural sector. This paper provides a theoretical and applied analysis of how fiat-collateralized stablecoins, a class of digital currency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, can address these long-standing challenges. We develop a farm-level profit maximization model incorporating transaction costs and credit constraints to demonstrate how stablecoins can enhance economic outcomes by (1) reducing the costs and risks of cross-border trade, (2) improving the efficiency and transparency of supply chain finance through smart contracts, and (3) expanding access to credit for smallholder farmers. We analyze key use cases, including parametric insurance and trade finance, while also considering the significant hurdles to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty and the digital divide. The paper concludes that while not a panacea, stablecoins represent a significant financial technology with the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift in agricultural economics, warranting further empirical investigation and policy support.</description>

      <title>Equity, Emissions and the Inflation Reduction Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preowned vehicles are disproportionally purchased by low-income households, a group that has long been unable to purchase electric vehicles. Yet, low-income households would disproportionally benefit from EV adoption given the operating costs savings offered by electrification. To help realize this benefit, provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act offer preowned EV purchasing incentives. How effective might these efforts be. Leveraging data from the United States Census Bureau, the National Household Travel Survey, and the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies Model, we address this question. Our findings are fourfold. First, we demonstrate that although low-income households are more likely to benefit from preowned EV purchasing incentives offered by IRA, up to 8.4 million low-income households may be ineligible owing to heterogeneity in vehicle procurement pathways. Second, we show that program ineligibility risks preventing up to 113.9 million tons in lifecycle emissions reduction benefits from being realized. Third, we find that procurement pathways depend on vehicle price. More expensive preowned vehicles are purchased directly from commercial dealers, while less expensive preowned vehicles are purchased from private sellers. These procurement pathways matter because qualification for IRA incentives necessitates purchasing solely from commercial dealers. Fourth, we demonstrate that while incentives motivating preowned vehicle purchases from commercial dealers may be effective if the vehicle is expensive, this effectiveness diminishes at higher price points. The implications of our findings on decarbonization efforts and energy policy are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enumerating the technological viability and climate impact of jet electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling battery technology has not achieved sufficient maturity to facilitate electric flight for all aircraft models across all distances. Consequently, existing discourse emphasizes electrifying short haul routes using smaller, lighter aircraft. Does this emphasis have merit. We estimate a model that addresses this question. Our findings are fourfold. First, we find that current energy density limitations impede short haul electric flight, regardless of aircraft model utilized. Second, we document that electrifying smaller, lighter aircraft models serving short haul routes may be particularly challenging as these aircraft require more, not less, acute increases in energy density. Third, we identify a subset of larger, heavier aircraft as better candidates for electrification and note that doing so could prevent the annual release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide equivalent. However, we observe that the regional benefits of electrification are highly heterogeneous. The largest emissions benefit is realized in Europe, followed by South America, North America, Oceania and Africa. Electrification flights originating in Asia produces a net increase in carbon emissions owing to the disproportionate share of miles claimed by Asian countries with a more carbon intensive electrical grid. Indian emissions warrant scrutiny, as its emissions contribution most disproportionately exceeds its mileage contribution. The implications of these findings for decarbonization policy are subsequently discussed.</description>

      <title>Human vs. Algorithmic Auditors: The Impact of Entity Type and Ambiguity on Human Dishonesty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most of the existing literature focused on human-machine interactions with algorithmic systems in advisory roles, research on human behavior in monitoring or verification processes that are conducted by automated systems remains largely absent. Our study examines how human dishonesty changes when detection of untrue statements is performed by machines versus humans, and how ambiguity in the verification process influences dishonest behavior. We design an incentivized laboratory experiment using a modified die-roll paradigm where participants privately observe a random draw and report the result, with higher reported numbers yielding greater monetary rewards. A probabilistic verification process introduces risk of detection and punishment, with treatments varying by verification entity (human vs. machine) and degree of ambiguity in the verification process (transparent vs. ambiguous). Our results show that under transparent verification rules, cheating magnitude does not significantly differ between human and machine auditors. However, under ambiguous conditions, cheating magnitude is significantly higher when machines verify participants' reports, reducing the prevalence of partial cheating while leading to behavioral polarization manifested as either complete honesty or maximal overreporting. The same applies when comparing reports to a machine entity under ambiguous and transparent verification rules. These findings emphasize the behavioral implications of algorithmic opacity in verification contexts. While machines can serve as effective and cost-efficient auditors under transparent conditions, their black box nature combined with ambiguous verification processes may unintentionally incentivize more severe dishonesty. These insights have practical implications for designing automated oversight systems in tax audits, compliance, and workplace monitoring.</description>

      <title>Explaining Apparently Inaccurate Self-assessments of Relative Performance: A Replication and Adaptation of 'Overconfident: Do you put your money on it?' by Hoelzl and Rustichini (2005)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study replicates and adapts the experiment of Hoelzl and Rustichini (2005), which examined overplacement, i.e., overconfidence in relative self-assessments, by analyzing individuals' voting preferences between a performance-based and a lottery-based bonus payment mechanism. The original study found underplacement - the majority of their sample apparently expected to perform worse than others - in difficult tasks with monetary incentives, contradicting the widely held assumption of a general human tendency toward overconfidence. This paper challenges the comparability of the two payment schemes, arguing that differences in outcome structures and non-monetary motives may have influenced participants' choices beyond misconfidence. In an online replication, a fixed-outcome distribution lottery mechanism with interdependent success probabilities and no variance in the number of winners - designed to better align with the performance-based payment scheme - is compared against the probabilistic-outcome distribution lottery used in the original study, which features an independent success probability and a variable number of winners. The results align more closely with traditional overplacement patterns than underplacement, as nearly three-fourths of participants prefer the performance-based option regardless of lottery design. Key predictors of voting behavior include expected performance, group performance estimations, and sample question outcomes, while factors such as social comparison tendencies and risk attitudes play no significant role. Self-reported voting rationales highlight the influence of normative beliefs, control preferences, and feedback signals beyond confidence. These results contribute to methodological discussions in overconfidence research by reassessing choice-based overconfidence measures and exploring alternative explanations for observed misplacement effects.</description>

      <title>Left Leaning Models: AI Assumptions on Economic Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does AI think about economic policy? While the use of large language models (LLMs) in economics is growing exponentially, their assumptions on economic issues remain a black box. This paper uses a conjoint experiment to tease out the main factors influencing LLMs' evaluation of economic policy. It finds that LLMs are most sensitive to unemployment, inequality, financial stability, and environmental harm and less sensitive to traditional macroeconomic concerns such as economic growth, inflation, and government debt. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most organizations rely on managers to identify talented workers. However, managers who are evaluated on team performance have an incentive to hoard workers. This study provides the first empirical evidence of talent hoarding using personnel records and survey evidence from a large firm. Talent hoarding is self-reported by three-fourths of managers, is detectable in manager ratings of worker talent, and occurs more frequently under stronger hoarding incentives, proxied by performance-related pay, team size, and talent visibility. Using quasi-random exposure to talent hoarding, I show that hoarding deters internal job applications, inhibiting career progression and altering talent allocation in the firm.</description>

      <title>Searching for Smurfs: Testing if Money Launderers Know Alert Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: To combat money laundering, banks raise and review alerts on transactions that exceed confidential thresholds. However, the thresholds may be leaked to criminals, allowing them to break up large transactions into amounts under the thresholds. This paper introduces a data-driven approach to detect the phenomenon, popularly known as smurfing.
  Methods: Our approach compares an observed transaction distribution to a counterfactual distribution estimated using a high-degree polynomial. We investigate the approach with simulation experiments and real transaction data from a systemically important Danish bank.
  Results: Our simulation experiments suggest that the approach can detect smurfing when as little as 0.1-0.5% of all transactions are subject to smurfing. On the real transaction data, we find no evidence of smurfing and, thus, no evidence of leaked thresholds.
  Conclusions: Our approach may be used to test if transaction thresholds have been leaked. This has practical implications for criminal justice and anti-money laundering (AML) systems. If criminals gain knowledge of AML alert thresholds, the effectiveness of the systems may be undermined. An implementation of our approach is available online, providing a free and easy-to-use tool for banks and financial supervisors. The null result obtained on our real data helps raise confidence in (though it cannot prove the effectiveness of) anti-money laundering efforts.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formal Framework of the Ethereum Staking Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how various categories of Ethereum stakers respond to changes in the consensus issuance schedule, and the potential impact of such changes on the composition of the staking market. To this end, we have develop and calibrate a game-theoretic model of the Ethereum staking market, incorporating strategic interactions between various staking agents. Our findings suggest that solo stakers may be more sensitive to variations in staking rewards than ETH holders using centralized exchanges or liquid staking providers. This increased sensitivity is driven not only by the cost structure of solo staking, but also by the competitive dynamics between different staking solutions in the market. When faced with a downward-sloping issuance schedule, staking agents compete for limited staking yields, and their choice of staking supply affects the revenues of other stakers. Therefore, the presence of other staking methods with access to MEV revenues and other DeFi yield sources when staking, as well as inattentive stakers, puts competitive pressure on solo stakers. Consequently, our model predicts that a reduction in issuance is likely to crowd out solo stakers. We present preliminary empirical evidence to support this result, using an instrumental variable estimation approach to estimate the yield elasticity of staking supply for different staking categories.</description>

      <title>Are Elites Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking? Evidence from MBA Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elites disproportionately influence policymaking, yet little is known about their fairness and efficiency preferences -- key determinants of support for redistributive policies. We investigate these preferences in an incentivized lab experiment with a group of future elites -- Ivy League MBA students. We find that MBA students implement substantially more unequal earnings distributions than the average American, regardless of whether inequality stems from luck or merit. Their redistributive choices are also highly responsive to efficiency costs, with an elasticity an order of magnitude larger than that found in representative U.S. samples. Analyzing fairness ideals, we find that MBA students are less likely to be strict meritocrats than the broader population. These findings provide novel insights into how elites' redistributive preferences may shape high levels of inequality in the U.S.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Lobbying Landscape: Insights from Opinion Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While lobbying has been demonstrated to have an important effect on public opinion and policy making, existing models of opinion formation do not specifically include its effect. In this work we introduce a new model of opinion dynamics where lobbyists can implement complex strategies and are characterised by a finite budget. Individuals update their opinions through a learning process resembling Bayesian learning, but influenced by cognitive biases such as under-reaction and confirmation bias. We study the model numerically and demonstrate rich dynamics both with and without lobbyists. In the presence of lobbying, we observe two regimes: one in which lobbyists can have full influence on the agent network, and another where the peer-effect generates polarisation. When symmetric lobbyists are present, the lobbyist influence regime is characterised by long opinion oscillations, while in the transition area between the two regimes we observe convergence to the optimistic model when the lobbying influence is long enough. These rich dynamics pave the way for studying real lobbying strategies to validate the model in practice.</description>
