      <title>Training nonlinear optical neural networks with Scattering Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep learning applications continue to deploy increasingly large artificial neural networks, the associated high energy demands are creating a need for alternative neuromorphic approaches. Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Dielectric-Graphene SERS Metasurfaces for Antibody Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platform based on dielectric silicon metasurfaces integrated with functionalized graphene for the selective detection of biomolecules such as prolactin and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The metasurface comprises subwavelength silicon nanopillars that support Mie-type optical resonances, enabling strong electromagnetic field confinement with minimal heating and optical losses. Graphene monolayers are transferred onto the dielectric metasurface and functionalized using 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE), facilitating the selective immobilization of target antibodies via $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions and covalent bonding. Graphene transfer, functionalization, and analyte binding are confirmed by the SERS enhancement, which enables label-free detection at low laser power, avoiding photodamage and ensuring compatibility with sensitive biomolecules. Strain and doping analysis, performed through Raman vector decomposition, reveals distinct responses associated with each antibody, validating the sensor's capability for molecular discrimination.</description>

      <title>Nano light-source generation by electron beam irradiation of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise allocation of nano light-sources in photonic integrated circuits is essential for the development of next-generation optical technologies such as optical nano-circuits, quantum information processing, and quantum communication. However, controlling the position of such light sources is a challenging task. We here show that halide perovskite nanoparticle light sources can be generated at the desired positions by electron beam. We applied cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 composite produced by thermal evaporation and discovered that the intensity of green light emission from the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles increased with electron beam irradiation. Changes in the cathodoluminescence spectrum associated with the electron beam irradiation suggest CsPbBr3 nanoparticle formations. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and controllability of the electron beam, we demonstrate nano-light source patterning on the film.</description>

      <title>Monolithic low-noise erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate waveguide amplifier with 18 dB fiber to fiber net gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers have captured great attentions in recent years due to the rapid advance of photonic integration materials and fabrication techniques. In this work, a compact erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate waveguide amplifier integrated with high-efficiency edge-couplers on the small footprint of 2 mm{\cross}25 mm, achieving &gt;18 dB fiber-to-fiber (off-chip) net gain with bidirectional pumping by ~1480 nm laser diodes, is fabricated by the photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching technique. The fiber-to-fiber noise figures of the amplifier are also characterized to be around 5 dB, and the maximum amplified signal powers at the output fiber are above 13 dBm. Theoretical amplifier modeling resolving the erbium absorption and emission spectra predicts the efficient gain scaling with waveguide length for most of the telecom C-band wavelengths. The demonstrated high-external-gain erbium-doped waveguide amplifier will benefit various applications from optical communication and metrology to integrated photonic computing and artificial intelligence</description>

      <title>Photonic Shankar skyrmion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a new topological quasiparticle of light in 3D space, named the photonic Shankar skyrmion. We show that an elliptically polarized field can be described by an SO(3) order parameter and it can form a texture in 3D space classified by the $\pi_3(SO(3))$ homotopy group, known as the Shankar skyrmion. We provide ways to construct the photonic Shankar skyrmion in static monochromatic waves and also in propagating wavepackets, the latter give rise to a flying topological quasiparticle. We demonstrate that the transition between the topological configuration and the trivial configuration gives rise to a novel topological singularity, which we call the $L^T$ surface. Such configurations of the electromagnetic field, under light-matter interaction, may lead to new phenomena in condensed matter physics and plasma physics, and are expected to find applications in quantum emulation and optical manipulation.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable miniaturized computational spectrometer enabled by photoelastic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniatured computational spectrometers, distinguished by their compact size and lightweight, have shown great promise for on-chip and portable applications in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, and industrial process monitoring. However, the common miniaturization strategies predominantly rely on advanced micro-nano fabrication and complex material engineering, limiting their scalability and affordability. Here, we present a broadband miniaturized computational spectrometer (ElastoSpec) by leveraging the photoelastic effect for easy-to-prepare and reconfigurable implementations. A single computational photoelastic spectral filter, with only two polarizers and a plastic sheet, is designed to be integrated onto the top of a CMOS sensor for snapshot spectral acquisition. The different spectral modulation units are directly generated from different spatial locations of the filter, due to the photoelastic-induced chromatic polarization effect of the plastic sheet. We experimentally demonstrate that ElastoSpec offers excellent reconstruction accuracy for the measurement of both simple narrowband and complex spectra. It achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) error of approximately 0.2 nm for monochromatic inputs, and maintains a mean squared error (MSE) value on the order of 10^-3 with only 10 spectral modulation units. Furthermore, we develop a reconfigurable strategy for enhanced spectra sensing performance through the flexibility in optimizing the modulation effectiveness and the number of spectral modulation units. This work avoids the need for complex micro-nano fabrication and specialized materials for the design of computational spectrometers, thus paving the way for the development of simple, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for on-chip and portable spectral sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational detection at the chip level.</description>

      <title>NHSE-Driven Coalescence of Topological Defect States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe a novel localization phenomena, the so-called topological defect accumulation, occurring in a non-Hermitian chain with an arbitrary number of defect sites. Specifically, it refers to the localization and coalescence of multiple defect eigenstates at a single defect site closest to the localization edge of the bulk non-Hermitian skin modes. This phenomenon is distinct from the conventional topological defect states in Hermitian systems, where the defect states are separately localized at their respective defect sites. The requirement for the onset of topological defect accumulation is the presence of non-reciprocal coupling which renders the chain non-Hermitian, as well as imaginary onsite potentials at the defect nodes. This allows the defect state accumulation and distribution to be modulated by both the defect site distribution and their corresponding onsite potentials paving the way for possible applications. Furthermore, this phenomenon is realizable in various synthetic and experimentally realizable platforms, such as topolectrical and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Seeing through randomness with topological light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitting structured light robustly through complex random media is crucial in many applications, from sensing to communication. Unfortunately, the spatial structure of light is distorted in such media due to refractive index inhomogeneities that cause multiple scattering, requiring mitigating strategies such as iterative optimisation and adaptive optics. Here, we use topological light to see through random media without the need for any corrective measures. Using skyrmions as our optical topology, we first demonstrate their robustness to randomness using controlled digital random phase masks before showing the universality of the approach with physical samples, from biological tissue to highly scattering materials. We benchmark the invariance of the topology against orbital angular momentum (OAM) and show no modal crosstalk using topology in channels where orbital angular momentum exhibits crosstalk greater than 70%. With the control in hand, we transmit images encoded into an alphabet of 10 topological numbers and show information transfer with high fidelity in regimes where traditional degrees of freedom, such as OAM, fail. Our work represents an important step towards noise-free transmission through noisy channels with the spatial structure of light without the need for active compensation strategies, opening potential applications in imaging, sensing and communicating with topology.</description>

      <title>Optical Cavity in Relativistic Regime for Laser Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser propulsion has been proposed for relativistic interstellar flights, but it faces the significant challenge of requiring extremely powerful laser radiation due to the inherently low momentum transfer between the beam and the sail. The photon-recycling technique enhances thrust by transferring momentum through multiple reflections within a cavity setup, formed by the lightsail and a ground-based mirror in a laser system array. In this work, a delay differential model is developed to describe the evolution of the beam and thrust, incorporating both the Doppler effect and the round-trip time delay experienced by each beam component. With optimized multilayer reflectors, the thrust performance gain is shown to be significant for interstellar flight, though limited by diffraction and the necessity of removing harmful redshifted radiation that could overheat the lightsail. By balancing thrust performance with thermal stability, we derive a simple condition for determining the spectral requirements of the mirrors. Given a selected laser wavelength, this condition fully specifies the necessary properties of the cavity mirrors, enabling the same system to effectively support a range of launch protocols.</description>

      <title>Regimes and Transitions of the Nonlinear Temporal Talbot Effect: Underlying Mechanism for A-Type Breathers, Soliton Crystals, and Soliton Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A frequency comb from a phase-modulated continuous-wave laser is subject to the temporal Talbot effect and modulational instability in an optical fiber or semiconductor. Using Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis and a dispersion relation for comb lines, I identify distinct regimes of the nonlinear Talbot effect of A-type breathers, soliton crystals, and soliton gas that arise from varying hierarchies of self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation, and the type of four-wave mixing (regular vs. cascaded). The temporal Talbot effect governs the spatio-temporal distribution of linear and nonlinear pulses and is closely related to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence phenomenon. The study advances the fields of Nonlinear Optics and Wave Theory.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cutoff Energy of Solid High-Harmonic Generation from Bonding Length Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) from solid state offers promising potential for attosecond optics with enhanced efficiency and compact configurations. However, Current implementations face critical limitations imposed by material damage thresholds, directly restricting spectral cutoff energies in nonperturbative regime. In this study, we control the cutoff energy through tailoring the bond length of materials, which is available by experimental strain. Employing real-time time-dependent density theory (rt-TDDFT) simulations, we find that the cutoff energy increases by nearly one third under a bond length compression of 7.5%. Our results reveal that it originates the band gap widening inducing the enhancement of interband cutoff energy, which is material-independent. This work provides novel theoretical insights for optimizing extreme ultraviolet sources, advancing potential applications in attosecond physics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce non-integrable singularities that may act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that material dissipation alone cannot regularize the singular behavior, in sharp contrast with reciprocal systems where any loss suffices. Instead, the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral response from linearly achiral membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral photonics aims to control and engineer light handedness for many applications in optical communications, biological and chemical sensing, and quantum technologies. While traditional approaches focus on engineering strong linear chiroptical response, nonlinear chiral phenomena remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a pronounced nonlinear chiral response in free-standing silicon membrane metasurfaces that are effectively achiral in the linear regime. By employing patterned membranes with both $C_4$-symmetry and intentionally broken in-plane symmetry, we reveal that strong nonlinear circular dichroism can be observed in third-harmonic generation. An unperturbed metasurface exhibits strong cross-polarized third-harmonic signal with nonlinear circular dichroism of the value $-0.83$, whereas in-plane symmetry breaking enables a co-polarized channel, and it reverses the sign of nonlinear circular dichroism that may be as large as the value $0.41$. Our findings suggest a novel approach for engineering nonlinear chiral responses in metasurfaces, complementing traditional approaches and paving the way towards advanced chiral metadevices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the frequency eigenchannels of ultrafast time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the interaction of waves with ultrafast time-varying materials - those that change on a time-scale commensurate with the wave period - holds much promise for developing a raft of new technologies. Time-varying materials exchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely new phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely considered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less attention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident waves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within ultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise specific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying medium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the spectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix enables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired spectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the medium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without spectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally or minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the temporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally concentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection. Our work paves the way towards new applications of ultrafast time-varying media, spanning from optics to microwaves and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in H$_2$O by Non-Harmonic Two-Color Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dramatic enhancement of supercontinuum generation (SCG) in H$_2$O driven by non-harmonic two-color laser fields, where pump and seed frequencies are not integer multiples. This scheme yields a broadband SC spectrum enhanced by approximately three orders of magnitude over the single-color case. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis, including isotope effects, show that the enhancement arises from soliton compression with resonant dispersive wave (RDW) emission, phase- and group-velocity-matched four-wave mixing (FWM), and cross-phase modulation (XPM), offering a versatile route to stronger SCG and noise suppression in broadband spectroscopy in H$_2$O, an emerging topic in attosecond and surface physics.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for multiplexing super-resolution confocal microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confocal microscopy has long been a cornerstone technique for visualizing complex interactions and processes within cellular structures. However, achieving super-resolution imaging of multiple organelles and their interactions simultaneously has remained a significant challenge. Here, we present a self-supervised learning approach to transform diffraction-limited, single-colour input images into multi-colour super-resolution outputs. Our approach eliminates the need for paired training data by utilizing a degradation model. By enhancing the resolution of confocal images and improving the identification and separation of cellular targets, this method bypasses the necessity for multi-wavelength excitation or parallel detection systems. Trained on an extensive dataset, the model effectively distinguishes and resolves multiple organelles with high fidelity, overcoming traditional imaging limitations. This technique requires no hardware modifications, making multi-colour super-resolution imaging accessible to any standard confocal microscope. We validated its performance by demonstrating two- and three-colour super-resolution imaging of both fixed and live cells. The technique offers a streamlined and data-efficient solution for multi-channel super-resolution microscopy, while opening new possibilities for investigating dynamic cellular processes with unprecedented clarity.</description>

      <title>Optimization of airgap in a monocentric lens assembly and metasurface based anti-reflecting coating in the long-wave IR regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to minimal aberration, larger field-of-view, and high resolution, monocentric lenses are preferred over other imagers in hemispherical image surface scenarios, particularly in the longwave infrared (LWIR) region. Herein, we study a monocentric lens assembly consisting of a ball lens and two hemispherical shell lenses of given radii of curvature and lens materials to enhance the transmission of LWIR ranging from 8 um to 12 um wavelength. We optimize the air gaps between the lenses of the assembly for a wider range of incidence angles assuming antireflecting coating (ARC) on all surfaces of the lenses. Additionally, the effect of temperature variation on the transmittance is also studied to attain an optimum air gap between the lenses. With the variation in incidence angle and temperature, modulations in focal length and spot size are reported for different wavelengths. Further, we propose a metasurface design to replace conventional multilayer ARCs to enhance the transmittance through the lens assembly over the given wavelength range for a wide field-of-view.</description>

      <title>Uniform and Tunable Structural Colors based on Ultrathin Lignin Optical Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural coloration offers a sustainable and non-fading alternative to conventional pigment- and dye-based colorants. In this study, we present a scalable strategy for generating vivid, tunable structural colors using ultrathin films of industrial kraft lignin. By employing solvent fractionation to isolate a methanol-soluble lignin fraction, followed by spin-coating onto silicon substrates, we achieve highly uniform films with controllable thickness. The observed colors originate from thin-film interference and span the entire visible spectrum by adjusting lignin concentration and spin speed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and transfer matrix modeling confirm that the interference is modulated by the film thickness. The lignin films exhibit robust mechanical properties, limited angular color shift, and fast, reversible optical response to humidity changes, enabling real-time environmental sensing. This approach circumvents the need for nanoparticle synthesis or self-assembly and highlights the potential of lignin, a widely available and underutilized biopolymer, as a functional photonic material for sustainable optical coatings and colorimetric sensors.</description>

      <title>The R-index: A universal metric for evaluating OAM content and mode purity in optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its pivotal role in optical manipulation, high-capacity communications, and quantum information, a general measure of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in structured light remains elusive. In optical fields, where multiple vortices coexist, the local nature of vortex OAM and the absence of a common rotation axis make the total OAM of the field difficult to quantify. Here, we introduce the R-index, a metric that captures the intrinsic OAM content of any structured optical field, from pure Laguerre-Gaussian modes to arbitrary multi-vortex superpositions. Not only does this metric quantify the total OAM, it also assesses field purity, providing insight into the fidelity and robustness of the OAM generation. By unifying OAM characterization into a single figure of merit, the R-index enables direct comparison across diverse beam profiles and facilitates the identification of optimal configurations for both foundational studies and applied technologies.</description>

      <title>Point upsampling networks for single-photon sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sensing has generated great interest as a prominent technique of long-distance and ultra-sensitive imaging, however, it tends to yield sparse and spatially biased point clouds, thus limiting its practical utility. In this work, we propose using point upsampling networks to increase point density and reduce spatial distortion in single-photon point cloud. Particularly, our network is built on the state space model which integrates a multi-path scanning mechanism to enrich spatial context, a bidirectional Mamba backbone to capture global geometry and local details, and an adaptive upsample shift module to correct offset-induced distortions. Extensive experiments are implemented on commonly-used datasets to confirm its high reconstruction accuracy and strong robustness to the distortion noise, and also on real-world data to demonstrate that our model is able to generate visually consistent, detail-preserving, and noise suppressed point clouds. Our work is the first to establish the upsampling framework for single-photon sensing, and hence opens a new avenue for single-photon sensing and its practical applications in the downstreaming tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Reconstruction for Vignetting-Free Upconversion Imaging through Scattering in ENZ Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical imaging through turbid or heterogeneous environments (collectively referred to as complex media) is fundamentally challenged by scattering, which scrambles structured spatial and phase information. To address this, we propose a hybrid-supervised deep learning framework to reconstruct high-fidelity images from nonlinear scattering measurements acquired with a time-gated epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) imaging system. The system leverages four-wave mixing (FWM) in subwavelength indium tin oxide (ITO) films to temporally isolate ballistic photons, thus rejecting multiply scattered light and enhancing contrast. To recover structured features from these signals, we introduce DeepTimeGate, a U-Net-based supervised model that performs initial reconstruction, followed by a Deep Image Prior (DIP) refinement stage using self-supervised learning. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across different imaging scenarios, including binary resolution patterns and complex vortex-phase masks, under varied scattering conditions. Compared to raw scattering inputs, it boosts average PSNR by 124%, SSIM by 231%, and achieves a 10 times improvement in intersection-over-union (IoU). Beyond enhancing fidelity, our method removes the vignetting effect and expands the effective field-of-view compared to the ENZ-based optical time gate output. These results suggest broad applicability in biomedical imaging, in-solution diagnostics, and other scenarios where conventional optical imaging fails due to scattering.</description>

      <title>On the nonreciprocal propagation of light waves in asymmetric lossy system of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nonreciprocity is the phenomenon where light behaves differently when traveling in the forward direction compared to the backward direction. This nonreciprocal behavior is typically achieved in systems that exhibit electromagnetic coupling, temporal variation, and nonlinear properties. In this work, we demonstrate that nonreciprocal behavior can also exist in an optically asymmetric lossy system without requiring these conditions. In our study, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal propagation of light waves in a passive asymmetric optical system made from a thin film that experiences some losses. Our theoretical analysis has been experimentally validated. This type of system can be utilized in passive nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Inducing macroscopic cat states of nonequilibrium electrons via cat-state light irradiation and projective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that projective measurements on quantum light can induce macroscopic cat states in many-electron systems driven by large-amplitude cat-state light. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with Schr\"odinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear kink movement through topological boundary state instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Enhancement of Electron-Phonon Interaction in 2H-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Waveguiding in two-dimensional Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Precision and cost of feedback cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for realistic parameter values.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that there exist frequency domain Berry curvature in the wave function of photons in dispersive optical systems. This property arises from the frequency dispersion of its dielectric function, which makes Maxwell equations a non-standard eigenvalue equation, with the eigenvalue (frequency) appearing inside the operator itself. We study this new Berry curvature effect on time refraction of magnetoplasmon-polariton as an example. It can induce deflection in the trajectory of a photon and make the ray swing.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic coherence and vorticity in room-temperature polariton condensate confined in a self-assembled perovskite microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13042</link>

Abstract: Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence, whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss, confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature, where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy with Tunable Visible Broadband Probe Pulse Generated by Kerr-Instability Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Universal on-chip polarization handling with deep photonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Model-free reinforcement learning with noisy actions for automated experimental control in optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Setting up and controlling optical systems is often a challenging and tedious task. The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training on simulations. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), or CrossQ, our agents learn to couple with 90% efficiency. A human expert reaches this efficiency, but the RL agents are quicker. In particular, the CrossQ agent outperforms the other agents in coupling speed while requiring only half the training time. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Long distance propagation of light in random media with partially coherent sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <title>Long distance propagation of wave beams in paraxial regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <title>Observation of Coherent Ferrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitation of ordered quantum phases gives rise to collective modes and quasiparticles, as exemplified by spin waves and magnons emerging from magnetic order. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of polarization waves and their fundamental quanta, ferrons. Here, we report the generation and transport of polarization waves, i.e., coherent ferrons, in the van der Waals ferroelectric material NbOI2. Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s. These long-lived, uniaxial, and dipole-carrying polarization waves may find applications in narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and coherent electric control.</description>
