      <title>Tracking the Activity of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS through its Perihelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to facilitate interplanetary spacecraft observationsof 3I/ATLAS, we have monitored and predicted the optical properties of its coma using both ground and space-based observations. Here, we describe how the data from space-based solar coronagraphs and the PUNCH mission enabled tracking of 3I/ATLAS's optical magnitude throughout its entire perihelion passage, including the period between October 8 and 30, 2025, when it was not visible from Earth.</description>

      <title>CH$_3$OH and HCN in Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Mapped with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array: Distinct Outgassing Behaviors and a Remarkably High CH$_3$OH/HCN Production Rate Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH) toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Compact Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on UT 2025 August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, and of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on September 12 and 15. These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p&gt;258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS).</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Cold Worlds: Age and Characterization of the Exoplanet COCONUTS-2b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying cold brown dwarfs is key to understanding the diverse characteristics of cold giant exoplanets atmospheres. COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Giant Planets in their Natal Disks with Consistent Accretion Torque (II): Parameter Survey and Condition for Outward Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration typically occurs during the formation of planets and is closely linked to the planetary formation process. In classical theories of non-accreting planetary migration, both type I and type II migration typically result in inward migration, which is hard to align with the architecture of the planetary systems.In this work, we conduct systematic, high-resolution 3D/2D numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the migration of an accreting planet. Under different disk conditions, we compared the dynamical evolution of planets with different planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that accretion of planets can significantly diminish the inward migration tendency of planets, or even change the migration direction. The migration of low-/high-mass planets is classified as Type I/II inward migration, respectively, while intermediate-mass planets, which have the strongest accretion, show an outward migration trend. We confirm that the outward migration is mainly attributed to the positive torque from the azimuthal asymmetric structures around the accreting planet, similar to Li et al. (2024). The termination of planetary mass growth is thus synonymous with the transition from outward to inward migration. For the high viscosity $\alpha=0.04$ and disk aspect ratio height $h_0=0.05$ cases, the mass ratio range for planetary outward migration is $1\times10^{-4}\lesssim q\lesssim4\times10^{-3}$. For the low viscosity case with $\alpha=0.001$, and/or the low disk aspect ratio cases $h_0=0.03$, the mass ratio range for the outward migration will shift toward the lower end. Our parameter survey reveals that a simple gap opening parameter determines the outward migration condition; details of the analytical interpretation are presented in Ida et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the differences in transmission and emission spectra for hot irradiated gaseous exoplanet Atmospheres: A comparison of 1D and 3D modeling using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets is fundamental to understanding their atmospheric physics and chemical processes. While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing of the White Dwarf-Cold Jupiter System WD 1856+534</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\dot{P} = 0.04\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \gtrsim 3.1 \times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.</description>

      <title>The 12CO Gas Structures of Protoplanetary Disks in the Upper Scorpius Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements of key protoplanetary disk properties inferred from parametric models of ALMA 12CO spectral line visibilities. We derive gas-disk radii, integrated fluxes, optically thick emission layers, and brightness temperature profiles for the disk population of the old (4 - 14 Myr) Upper Scorpius star-forming region. We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N &gt; 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio &lt;z/r&gt; ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.</description>

      <title>TriPoDPy: 1D Tri-Population size distributions forDust evolution in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TriPoDPy is a code simulating the dust evolution, including dust growth and dynamics in protoplanetary disks using the parametric dust model presented in (Pfeil et al., 2024). The simulation evolves a dust distribution in a one-dimensional grid in the radial direction. It's written in Python and the core routines are implemented in Fortran90. The code not only solves for the evolution of the dust but also the gas disk with the canonical alpha-description (Shakura &amp; Sunyaev, 1973). In addition to the original model, we added descriptions of tracers for the dust and gas, which could be used for compositional tracking of additional components.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dust Masses of Protoplanetary Disks in Serpens and L1641/L1647 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are an essential component of the planet-formation process. The amount of dust and gas in the disk constrains the number and size of planets that can form in a system. We analyze 178 T-Tauri stars, 18 in Serpens and 160 in L1641/L1647, and measure their disk dust masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and multiwavelength data, including 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) fluxes from the literature. The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.</description>

      <title>The WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey: Expanding WEAVE's Reach to Bright and Low-Surface-Density Targets with a Novel Observing Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We began the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>Enriched volatiles and refractories but deficient titanium on the dayside atmosphere of WASP-121b revealed by JWST/NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With dayside temperatures elevated enough for all atmospheric constituents to be present in gas form, ultra-hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to probe the composition of giant planets. We aim to infer the composition and thermal structure of the dayside atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b from two NIRISS$/$SOSS secondary eclipses observed as part of a full phase curve. We extract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction pipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to explore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium condensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed dayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a stratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral contributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We measure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched (~10x stellar) but comparatively titanium poor (~1x stellar), potentially due to partial cold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether reflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a geometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted Ag = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be consistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere enriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory titanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap. Considering H2O dissociation is critical in free retrieval analyses, leading to order-of-magnitude differences in retrieved abundances for WASP-121b if neglected. Simple chemical equilibrium retrievals assuming that all species are governed by a single metallicity parameter drastically overpredict the TiO abundance.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Mapping with Ariel: Future Prospects for a Population-Level Mapping Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our demographic understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.</description>
