      <title>Honesty-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for High-Fidelity Synthetic Data Generation in Digital Psychiatric Intake Doctor-Patient Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity and unreliable self-reporting -- such as concealment or exaggeration -- pose fundamental challenges to psychiatric intake and assessment. We propose a multi-agent synthesis framework that explicitly models patient deception to generate high-fidelity, publicly releasable synthetic psychiatric intake records. Starting from DAIC-WOZ interviews, we construct enriched patient profiles and simulate a four-role workflow: a \emph{Patient} completes self-rated scales and participates in a semi-structured interview under a topic-dependent honesty state; an \emph{Assessor} selects instruments based on demographics and chief complaints; an \emph{Evaluator} conducts the interview grounded in rater-administered scales, tracks suspicion, and completes ratings; and a \emph{Diagnostician} integrates all evidence into a diagnostic summary. Each case links the patient profile, self-rated and rater-administered responses, interview transcript, diagnostic summary, and honesty state. We validate the framework through four complementary evaluations: diagnostic consistency and severity grading, chain-of-thought ablations, human evaluation of clinical realism and dishonesty modeling, and LLM-based comparative evaluation. The resulting corpus spans multiple disorders and severity levels, enabling controlled study of dishonesty-aware psychiatric assessment and the training and evaluation of adaptive dialogue agents.</description>

      <title>TiInsight: A SQL-based Automated Exploratory Data Analysis System through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SQL-based exploratory data analysis has garnered significant attention within the data analysis community. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration. However, existing methods generally lack the ability for cross-domain analysis, and the exploration of LLMs capabilities remains insufficient. This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets.

      <title>Towards Improving Interpretability of Language Model Generation through a Structured Knowledge Discovery Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced text generation aims to enhance the quality of generated text by utilizing internal or external knowledge sources. While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Query Languages for Machine-Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I discuss two logics for weighted finite structures: first-order logic with summation (FO(SUM)) and its recursive extension IFP(SUM). These logics originate from foundational work by Gr\"adel, Gurevich, and Meer in the 1990s. In recent joint work with Standke, Steegmans, and Van den Bussche, we have investigated these logics as query languages for machine learning models, specifically neural networks, which are naturally represented as weighted graphs. I present illustrative examples of queries to neural networks that can be expressed in these logics and discuss fundamental results on their expressiveness and computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Global Benchmark Database (GBD), a comprehensive suite of tools for provisioning and sustainably maintaining benchmark instances and their metadata. The availability of benchmark metadata is essential for many tasks in empirical research, e.g., for the data-driven compilation of benchmarks, the domain-specific analysis of runtime experiments, or the instance-specific selection of solvers. In this paper, we introduce the data model of GBD as well as its interfaces and provide examples of how to interact with them. We also demonstrate the integration of custom data sources and explain how to extend GBD with additional problem domains, instance formats and feature extractors.</description>

      <title>A Memory-Efficient Distributed Algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search with Arbitrary Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search has become a central task in modern data-intensive applications, particularly when operating on large, heterogeneous, or high-dimensional datasets. However, many existing ANN methods struggle in such scenarios, either because they rely on metric assumptions or because their indexing strategies are not well suited to distributed environments or to settings with constrained memory resources.
  This work introduces PDASC (Parametrizable Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Clustering), a distributed ANN search algorithm whose index design simultaneously supports arbitrary dissimilarity functions and efficient deployment in distributed, storage-aware environments. PDASC builds a distributed hierarchical index based on clustering mechanisms that are agnostic to distance properties, thereby accommodating non-metric and domain-specific similarities while naturally partitioning indexing and search across multiple computing nodes, with a compact per-node memory footprint. By preserving locally informative neighbourhood structure, the proposed index mitigates practical manifestations of the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. We analyse how the index structural parameters govern the trade-offs among recall, computational cost, and memory usage.
  Experimental evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and distance functions shows that PDASC achieves competitive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs while consistently requiring lower per-node memory compared to state-of-the-art ANN methods. By avoiding reliance on specialised hardware acceleration, PDASC enables scalable and energy-efficient similarity search in heterogeneous and distributed settings where memory efficiency and distance-function flexibility are first-class constraints.</description>

      <title>Pervasive Annotation Errors Break Text-to-SQL Benchmarks and Leaderboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed many text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.
