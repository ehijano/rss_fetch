      <title>An effective model for describing coherent population trapping resonances, which correctly takes into account the off-resonant frequency components in periodically modulated laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and test an effective model for calculating the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance in a periodically modulated laser field, when the modulation frequency $f$ varies near the fractional part of hyperfine splitting frequency in the ground state $\Delta_{\rm hfs}/N$ (where $N=1,2,...$). In such a polychromatic light, only two frequency components that are most resonant with the working optical transitions in the atom are accurately taken into account, while all other non-resonant frequency components are taken into account using the second-order perturbation theory in the field. Within the presented concept, equation for the atomic density matrix is obtained, in which taking into account of all non-resonant frequency components is reduced to the appearance of two new operators (non-diagonal, in the general case): the shift and relaxation operators. The adequacy of the presented effective model was verified by numerical calculations of various dependencies, in which we did not find visual differences from the exact calculations. Our model provides a clear physical picture of various features of CPT spectroscopy in periodically modulated light, including effects that have not been discussed in the scientific literature before. In particular, we show that the widespread viewpoint that the CPT resonance shift is determined by the usual ac Stark shifts of the lower levels is, in general, fundamentally incorrect, since the contribution to the light shift due to beats at the frequency $\Delta_{\rm hfs}$ between different non-resonant frequency components can be comparable to (or even dominate) with respect to the value of the standard ac Stark shift. Therefore, even if we have detailed information on the spectral composition of the laser field (e.g. using a spectrum analyzer), this is, in general, absolutely insufficient to determine the light shift of the CPT resonance.</description>

      <title>Thermal-Gradient Cooling of Atomic Vapor Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of high optical depth and long coherence time in atomic ensembles faces a fundamental thermodynamic constraint: heating enhances light-atom coupling via increased density but degrades coherence through thermal broadening, while laser cooling preserves coherence at the cost of density loss. Here, we demonstrate a non-equilibrium strategy that spatially achieves a negative correlation between density and temperature via controlled thermal-gradient transport. By engineering a temperature gradient via laser-cooling in a hot vapor cell, we drive a convective atomic fluid that expels hot atoms at the boundary while confining low-temperature atoms in the central region. This dynamic process sustains a density of 10^22m^-3 and a temperature of tens of kelvins at the center. A theoretical scheme based on the Boltzmann-type transport equation is established, which gives Navier-Stokes equations for non-equilibrium thermal-gradient atomic fluid. The results of numerical simulation indicate that this scheme can enhance the optical depth while reducing the temperature of the system, establishing a route to bypass equilibrium thermodynamics in room-temperature atom-light interactions, boosting high-performance quantum metrology and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Single-frequency inverted Doppler-free resonance as a platform for chip-scale optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the possibility to obtain a high-quality inverted Doppler-free resonance in D1 line of alkali-metal atoms in the single-frequency regime. The counter-propagating optical fields with linear and mutually orthogonal polarizations and the transition Fg=I+1/2 --&gt; Fe=I-1/2 are proposed to the use. We establish the best possible nuclear spin value and the corresponding atomic isotope for this regime. Our experiment demonstrates that the resonance contrast-to-width ratio in the single-frequency regime is practically the same as in the dual-frequency regime, which simplifies the optical module to be used in compact optical clocks. The achieved short-term frequency stability is 3*10^(-13) at 1 s, which is comparable to results that can be obtained with the dual-frequency technique.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Microwave-field quantum metrology with error correction enabled by Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieve a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here we combine capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and to be used for quantum information processing to largely overcome the issue of detection losses. While using the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $39\ \mathrm{nV}/\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity we employ the inter-atomic dipolar interactions to execute an error-correction protocol, that protects sensing information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the idea of the protocol is based on introduction of additional non-linear lossy quantum channel, which results in enhancement of Fisher information by a factor of 3.3. The presented results open up a path towards broader usage of quantum-information-inspired error correction in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered abnormally strong influence of the magnetic field on the optical properties of atomic ensemble confined in a waveguide. We demonstrate qualitative changes in the character of spontaneous emission and single-atom susceptibility. Based on the revealed effects, we propose a new scheme of true single photon source. Furthermore, we propose the highly-efficient optical gate using just one atom.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian optimization in deep cooling atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser cooling, which cools atomic and molecular gases to near absolute zero, is the crucial initial step for nearly all atomic gas experiments. However, fast achievement of numerous sub-$\mu$K cold atoms is challenging. To resolve the issue, we propose and experimentally validate an intelligent polarization gradient cooling approach enhanced by optical lattice, utilizing Maximum Hypersphere Compensation Sampling Bayesian Optimization (MHCS-BO). MHCS-BO demonstrates a twofold increase in optimization efficiency and superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional Bayesian optimization. Finally, approximate $10^8$ cold atoms at a temperature of 0.4$\pm$0.2 $\mu$K can be achieved given the optimal parameters within 15 minutes. Our work provides an intelligent protocol, which can be generalized to other high-dimension parameter optimization problems, and paves way for preparation of ultracold atom in quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Lindblad dynamics via time-rescaling engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal method for accelerating Lindblad dynamics that preserves the original trajectory through Hilbert space. The technique provides exact fast processes analytically, which are Markovian and do not require manipulation of the environment properties, by time-rescaling a reference dynamics. In particular, the engineered control protocols are based only on local interactions, and no additional control fields are required compared to the reference protocol. We demonstrate the scheme with two examples: a driven two-level system in an amplitude damping channel and the dissipative transverse field Ising model. We also show that, by starting with a reference process which is the fastest connecting two states under a certain constraint, the method provides other optimal processes satisfying modified constraints. Our approach can help advance techniques for quantum control and computation towards more complex noisy systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A comparison of single- and two-color schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>
