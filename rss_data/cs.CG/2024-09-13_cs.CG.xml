      <title>Towards Instance-Optimal Euclidean Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean spanners are important geometric objects that have been extensively studied since the 1980s. The two most basic "compactness'' measures of a Euclidean spanner $E$ are the size (number of edges) $|E|$ and the weight (sum of edge weights) $\|E\|$. In this paper, we initiate the study of instance optimal Euclidean spanners. Our results are two-fold.
  We demonstrate that the greedy spanner is far from being instance optimal, even when allowing its stretch to grow. More concretely, we design two hard instances of point sets in the plane, where the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for basically any parameter $x \geq 1$) has $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1/2}) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1}) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$, where $E_\mathrm{spa}$ and $E_\mathrm{light}$ denote the per-instance sparsest and lightest $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners, respectively, and the $\Omega_x$ notation suppresses a polynomial dependence on $1/x$.
  As our main contribution, we design a new construction of Euclidean spanners, which is inherently different from known constructions, achieving the following bounds: a stretch of $1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^*(d/\epsilon))}$ with $O(1) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $O(1) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$. In other words, we show that a slight increase to the stretch suffices for obtaining instance optimality up to an absolute constant for both sparsity and lightness. Remarkably, there is only a log-star dependence on the dimension in the stretch, and there is no dependence on it whatsoever in the number of edges and weight.</description>

      <title>A Gap-ETH-Tight Approximation Scheme for Euclidean TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic task of finding the shortest tour of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any fixed constant $d \geq 2$. We determine the optimal dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time of an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate tour, under a plausible assumption. Specifically, we give an algorithm that runs in $2^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n\log n$ time. This improves the previously smallest dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time $(1/\varepsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}n \log n$ of the algorithm by Rao and Smith~(STOC 1998). We also show that a $2^{o(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}\text{poly}(n)$ algorithm would violate the Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH).
  Our new algorithm builds upon the celebrated quadtree-based methods initially proposed by Arora (J. ACM 1998), but it adds a new idea that we call \emph{sparsity-sensitive patching}. On a high level this lets the granularity with which we simplify the tour depend on how sparse it is locally. We demonstrate that our technique extends to other problems, by showing that for Steiner Tree and Rectilinear Steiner Tree it yields the same running time. We complement our results with a matching Gap-ETH lower bound for Rectilinear Steiner Tree.</description>

      <title>Clustering with Few Disks to Minimize the Sum of Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of $n$ points in the Euclidean plane, the $k$-MinSumRadius problem asks to cover this point set using $k$ disks with the objective of minimizing the sum of the radii of the disks. After a long line of research on related problems, it was finally discovered that this problem admits a polynomial time algorithm [GKKPV~'12]; however, the running time of this algorithm is $O(n^{881})$, and its relevance is thereby mostly of theoretical nature. A practically and structurally interesting special case of the $k$-MinSumRadius problem is that of small $k$. For the $2$-MinSumRadius problem, a near-quadratic time algorithm with expected running time $O(n^2 \log^2 n \log^2 \log n)$ was given over 30 years ago [Eppstein~'92].
  We present the first improvement of this result, namely, a near-linear time algorithm to compute the $2$-MinSumRadius that runs in expected $O(n \log^2 n \log^2 \log n)$ time. We generalize this result to any constant dimension $d$, for which we give an $O(n^{2-1/(\lceil d/2\rceil + 1) + \varepsilon})$ time algorithm. Additionally, we give a near-quadratic time algorithm for $3$-MinSumRadius in the plane that runs in expected $O(n^2 \log^2 n \log^2 \log n)$ time. All of these algorithms rely on insights that uncover a surprisingly simple structure of optimal solutions: we can specify a linear number of lines out of which one separates one of the clusters from the remaining clusters in an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>
