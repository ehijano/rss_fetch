      <title>Learning Robust Representations for Communications over Interference-limited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of cellular networks, users located at the periphery of cells are particularly vulnerable to substantial interference from neighbouring cells, which can be represented as a two-user interference channel. This study introduces two highly effective methodologies, namely TwinNet and SiameseNet, using autoencoders, tailored for the design of encoders and decoders for block transmission and detection in interference-limited environments. The findings unambiguously illustrate that the developed models are capable of leveraging the interference structure to outperform traditional methods reliant on complete orthogonality. While it is recognized that systems employing coordinated transmissions and independent detection can offer greater capacity, the specific gains of data-driven models have not been thoroughly quantified or elucidated. This paper conducts an analysis to demonstrate the quantifiable advantages of such models in particular scenarios. Additionally, a comprehensive examination of the characteristics of codewords generated by these models is provided to offer a more intuitive comprehension of how these models achieve superior performance.</description>

      <title>List-Decoding Capacity Implies Capacity on the q-ary Symmetric Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Shannon capacity of the q-ary symmetric channel (qSC) is the same as the list-decoding capacity of an adversarial channel, raising the question of whether there is a formal (and black-box) connection between the two. We show that there is: Any linear code $C\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n$ that has minimum distance $d_{\min}=\omega(q^3)$ and achieves list-decoding capacity also achieves capacity on the qSC.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks Against Double RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems-based Autoencoder in Finite-Scattering Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoencoder permits the end-to-end optimization and design of wireless communication systems to be more beneficial than traditional signal processing. However, this emerging learning-based framework has weaknesses, especially sensitivity to physical attacks. This paper explores adversarial attacks against a double reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-based autoencoder, where an adversary employs encoded and decoded datasets to create adversarial perturbation and fool the system. Because of the complex and dynamic data structures, adversarial attacks are not unique, each having its own benefits. We, therefore, propose three algorithms generating adversarial examples and perturbations to attack the RIS-MIMO-based autoencoder, exploiting the gradient descent and allowing for flexibility via varying the input dimensions. Numerical results show that the proposed adversarial attack-based algorithm significantly degrades the system performance regarding the symbol error rate compared to the jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>Characterization of $n$-Dimensional Toric and Burst-Error-Correcting Quantum Codes from Lattice Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for the development of any scalable quantum computer. In this work we introduce a generalization of a quantum interleaving method for combating clusters of errors in toric quantum error-correcting codes. We present new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes, where $n\geq 5$, which are featured by lattice codes and apply the proposed quantum interleaving method to such new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes. Through the application of this method to these novel $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes we derive new $n$-dimensional quantum burst-error-correcting codes. Consequently, $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes and burst-error-correcting quantum codes are provided offering both a good code rate and a significant coding gain when it comes to toric quantum codes. Another important consequence from the presented $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes is that if the Golomb and Welch conjecture in \cite{perfcodes} regarding the Lee sphere in $n$ dimensions for the respective close packings holds true, then it follows that these $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes are the only possible ones to be obtained from lattice codes. Moreover, such a methodology can be applied for burst error correction in cases involving localized errors, quantum data storage and quantum channels with memory.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Direct Source Localization for Passive Movement-Driven Virtual Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel smartphone-enabled localization technology for ambient Internet of Things (IoT) devices, leveraging the widespread use of smartphones. By utilizing the passive movement of a smartphone, we create a virtual large array that enables direct localization using only angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. Unlike traditional two-step localization methods, direct localization is unaffected by AoA estimation errors in the initial step, which are often caused by multipath channels and noise. However, direct localization methods typically require prior environmental knowledge to define the search space, with calculation time increasing as the search space expands. To address limitations in current direct localization methods, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based direct localization technique. This technique combines ML with an adaptive matching pursuit procedure, dynamically generating search spaces for precise source localization. The adaptive matching pursuit minimizes location errors despite potential accuracy fluctuations in ML across various training and testing environments. Additionally, by estimating the reflection source's location, we reduce the effects of multipath channels, enhancing localization accuracy. Extensive three-dimensional ray-tracing simulations demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art direct localization techniques in computational efficiency and operates independently of prior environmental knowledge.</description>

      <title>K-step Vector Approximate Survey Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP), originally developed to address high-dimensional linear inverse problems, has found widespread applications in signal processing and statistical inference. Among its notable variants, Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP), Generalized Approximate Survey Propagation (GASP), and Vector Approximate Survey Propagation (VASP) have demonstrated effectiveness even when the assumed generative models differ from the true models. However, many fundamental questions regarding model mismatch remain unanswered. For instance, it is still unclear what level of model mismatch is required for the postulated posterior estimate (PPE) to exhibit a replica symmetry breaking (RSB) structure in the extremum conditions of its free energy, and what order of RSB is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a novel approximate message passing algorithm that incorporates K-step RSB (KRSB) and naturally reduces to VAMP and VASP with specific parameter selections. We refer to this as the K-step VASP (KVASP) algorithm. Simulations show that KVASP significantly outperforms VAMP and GASP in estimation accuracy, particularly when the assumed prior has discrete support and the measurement matrix is non-i.i.d.. Additionally, the state evolution (SE) of KVASP, derived heuristically, accurately tracks the per-iteration mean squared error (MSE). A comparison between the SE and the free energy under the KRSB ansatz reveals that the fixed-point equations of SE align with the saddle-point equations of the free energy. This suggests that, once the KRSB ansatz holds and the SE fixed point is reached, KVASP can accurately compute the PPE in the large system limit (LSL).</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Multiple Access with Simultaneous Non-unique Decoding in Strong Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) is gaining attention as an innovative technology for boosting diversity and multiplexing gains. As a key innovation, it presents the possibility to overcome interference by position reconfigurability on one radio frequency (RF) chain, giving rise to the concept of fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA). While FAMA is originally designed to deal with interference mainly by position change and treat interference as noise, this is not rate optimal, especially when suffering from a strong interference channel (IC) where all positions have strong interference. To tackle this, this paper considers a two-user strong IC where FAMA is used in conjunction with simultaneous nonunique decoding (SND). Specifically, we analyze the key statistics for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interference-to-noise ratio (INR) for a canonical two-user IC setup, and subsequently derive the delay outage rate (DOR), outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) of the FAMA-IC. Our numerical results illustrate huge benefits of FAMA with SND over traditional fixed-position antenna systems (TAS) with SND in the fading IC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) networks are envisioned to support intelligent applications across various vertical scenarios, which have stringent requirements on high-precision sensing as well as ultra-low-latency data processing and decision making. Towards this end, a new paradigm of edge perception networks emerges, which integrates wireless sensing, communication, computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities at network edge for intelligent sensing and data processing. This article provides a timely overview on this emerging topic. We commence by discussing wireless edge perception, including physical layer transceiver design, network-wise cooperation, and application-specific data analytics, for which the prospects and challenges are emphasized. Next, we discuss the interplay between edge AI and wireless sensing in edge perception, and present various key techniques for two paradigms, namely edge AI empowered sensing and task-oriented sensing for edge AI, respectively. Finally, we emphasize interesting research directions on edge perception to motivate future works.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Puncturing Patterns of 5G NR LDPC Codes for Few-Iteration Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-matching of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes enables a single code description to support a wide range of code lengths and rates. In 5G NR, rate matching is accomplished by extending (lifting) a base code to a desired target length and by puncturing (not transmitting) certain code bits. LDPC codes and rate matching are typically designed for the asymptotic performance limit with an ideal decoder. Practical LDPC decoders, however, carry out tens or fewer message-passing decoding iterations to achieve the target throughput and latency of modern wireless systems. We show that one can optimize LDPC code puncturing patterns for such few-iteration-constrained decoders using a method we call swapping of punctured and transmitted blocks (SPAT). Our simulation results show that SPAT yields from 0.20 dB up to 0.55 dB improved signal-to-noise ratio performance compared to the standard 5G NR LDPC code puncturing pattern for a wide range of code lengths and rates.</description>

      <title>A totally empirical basis of science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical hypothesis testing is the central method to demarcate scientific theories in both exploratory and inferential analyses. However, whether this method befits such purpose remains a matter of debate. Established approaches to hypothesis testing make several assumptions on the data generation process beyond the scientific theory. Most of these assumptions not only remain unmet in realistic datasets, but often introduce unwarranted bias in the analysis. Here, we depart from such restrictive assumptions to propose an alternative framework of total empiricism. We derive the Information-test ($I$-test) which allows for testing versatile hypotheses including non-null effects. To exemplify the adaptability of the $I$-test to application and study design, we revisit the hypothesis of interspecific metabolic scaling in mammals, ultimately rejecting both competing theories of pure allometry.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Inference over Wireless Channels with Feature Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative inference among multiple wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for sensing and computer vision. This approach typically involves a three-stage process: a) data acquisition through sensing, b) feature extraction, and c) feature encoding for transmission. However, transmitting the extracted features poses a significant privacy risk, as sensitive personal data can be exposed during the process. To address this challenge, we propose a novel privacy-preserving collaborative inference mechanism, wherein each edge device in the network secures the privacy of extracted features before transmitting them to a central server for inference. Our approach is designed to achieve two primary objectives: 1) reducing communication overhead and 2) ensuring strict privacy guarantees during feature transmission, while maintaining effective inference performance. Additionally, we introduce an over-the-air pooling scheme specifically designed for classification tasks, which provides formal guarantees on the privacy of transmitted features and establishes a lower bound on classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>The maximum storage capacity of open-loop written RRAM is around 4 bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been a plethora of research on multi-level memory devices, where the resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a prominent example. Although it is easy to write an RRAM device into multiple (even quasi-continuous) states, it suffers from the inherent variations that should limit the storage capacity, especially in the open-loop writing scenario. There have been many experimental results in this regard, however, it lacks a comprehensive analysis of the valid multi-bit storage capability, especially in theoretical terms. The absence of such an insight usually results in misleading conclusions that either exaggerate or underestimate the storage capacity of RRAM devices. Here, by the concept of information theory, we present a model for evaluating the storage capacity of open-loop written RRAM. Based on the experimental results in the literature and the test results of our own devices, we have carefully examined the effects of number of pre-defined levels, conductance variation, and conductance range, on the storage capacity. The analysis leads to a conclusion that the maximum capacity of RRAM devices is around 4 bits.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Jamming Mitigation with Movable Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reveals the potential of movable antennas in enhancing anti-jamming communication. We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</description>

      <title>Injectivity capacity of ReLU gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the injectivity property of the ReLU networks layers. Determining the ReLU injectivity capacity (ratio of the number of layer's inputs and outputs) is established as isomorphic to determining the capacity of the so-called $\ell_0$ spherical perceptron. Employing \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) a powerful program is developed and utilized to handle the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptron and implicitly the ReLU layers injectivity. To put the entire fl RDT machinery in practical use, a sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well. The lifting mechanism is observed to converge remarkably fast with relative corrections in the estimated quantities not exceeding $\sim 0.1\%$ already on the third level of lifting. Closed form explicit analytical relations among key lifting parameters are uncovered as well. In addition to being of incredible importance in handling all the required numerical work, these relations also shed a new light on beautiful parametric interconnections within the lifting structure. Finally, the obtained results are also shown to fairly closely match the replica predictions from [40].</description>

      <title>Performance of User-Assisted Nonlinear Energy Harvesting NOMA Network with Alamouti/MRC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on evaluating the outage performance of a dual-hop single-phase non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) system. The base station employs the Alamouti space-time block coding technique (Alamouti-STBC), enabling simultaneous communication with two mobile users, and the far user employs a maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme. In this setup, the near user serves as a full-duplex (FD) (or half-duplex (HD)) energy harvesting (EH) relay, adopting decode-and-forward (DF) protocol for the far user. The study involves the development of a system model and the closed-form equations of exact and asymptotic outage probabilities (OP) over Nakagami-m fading channels with and without direct link considering a threshold-based nonlinear EH relaying model. We verify analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations and show that the presence of a direct link in the system enhances the performance of the far user considerably by mitigating the degradation caused by the self-interference in the near user.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel coding: Approximation algorithms and strong converse exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relaxations of entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding and establish that non-signaling assistance and the meta-converse are equivalent in terms of success probabilities. We then present a rounding procedure that transforms any non-signaling-assisted strategy into an entanglement-assisted one and prove an approximation ratio of $(1 - e^{-1})$ in success probabilities for the special case of measurement channels. For fully quantum channels, we give a weaker (dimension dependent) approximation ratio, that is nevertheless still tight to characterize the strong converse exponent of entanglement-assisted channel coding [Li and Yao, arXiv:2209.00555]. Our derivations leverage ideas from position-based decoding, quantum decoupling theorems, the matrix Chernoff inequality, and input flattening techniques.</description>

      <title>On Homomorphic Encryption Based Strategies for Class Imbalance in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance in training datasets can lead to bias and poor generalization in machine learning models. While pre-processing of training datasets can efficiently address both these issues in centralized learning environments, it is challenging to detect and address these issues in a distributed learning environment such as federated learning. In this paper, we propose FLICKER, a privacy preserving framework to address issues related to global class imbalance in federated learning. At the heart of our contribution lies the popular CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme, which is used by the clients to privately share their data attributes, and subsequently balance their datasets before implementing the FL scheme. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the FL accuracy numbers when used along with popular datasets and relevant baselines.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Quantum Estimators for Pure-State Trace Distance and Fidelity via Samplizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace distance and infidelity (induced by square root fidelity), as basic measures of the closeness of quantum states, are commonly used in quantum state discrimination, certification, and tomography. However, the sample complexity for their estimation still remains open. In this paper, we solve this problem for pure states. We present a quantum algorithm that estimates the trace distance and square root fidelity between pure states to within additive error $\varepsilon$, given sample access to their identical copies. Our algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity $\Theta(1/\varepsilon^2)$, improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^4)$. Our algorithm is composed of a samplized phase estimation of the product of two Householder reflections. Notably, an improved (multi-)samplizer for pure states is used as an algorithmic tool in our construction, through which any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to the reflection operator about a pure state $|\psi\rangle$ can be converted to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum sample algorithm using $\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $|\psi\rangle$. This samplizer for pure states is shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP), originally designed to solve high-dimensional linear inverse problems, has found broad applications in signal processing and statistical inference. Among its key variants, Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP) and Generalized Approximate Survey Propagation (GASP) have demonstrated effectiveness even in scenarios where the assumed generative models differ from the true models. However, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) versions of VAMP and GASP have limitations: VAMP is restricted to differentiable priors and likelihoods, while GASP requires the measurement matrix to have independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a new algorithm, Vector Approximate Survey Propagation (VASP). VASP utilizes survey propagation to handle non-differentiable priors and likelihoods, along with employs vector-form messages to account for correlations in the measurement matrix. Simulations reveal that VASP significantly surpasses VAMP and GASP in estimation accuracy, particularly when the assumed prior is discrete-supported and the measurement matrix is non-i.i.d.. Additionally, the state evolution (SE) of VASP, derived heuristically, accurately reflects the per-iteration mean squared error (MSE). A comparison between the SE and the free energy computed by Takahashi and Kabashima under the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) ansatz shows that the SE's fixed-point equations align with the free energy's saddle point equations. This suggests that VASP efficiently implements the postulated MAP estimator (which is NP-hard in the worst case) with cubic computational complexity, assuming the 1RSB ansatz is valid.</description>

      <title>Securing MIMO Wiretap Channel with Learning-Based Friendly Jamming under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communications are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to their broadcast nature. To effectively deal with eavesdroppers, existing security techniques usually require accurate channel state information (CSI), e.g., for friendly jamming (FJ), and/or additional computing resources at transceivers, e.g., cryptography-based solutions, which unfortunately may not be feasible in practice. This challenge is even more acute in low-end IoT devices. We thus introduce a novel deep learning-based FJ framework that can effectively defeat eavesdropping attacks with imperfect CSI and even without CSI of legitimate channels. In particular, we first develop an autoencoder-based communication architecture with FJ, namely AEFJ, to jointly maximize the secrecy rate and minimize the block error rate at the receiver without requiring perfect CSI of the legitimate channels. In addition, to deal with the case without CSI, we leverage the mutual information neural estimation (MINE) concept and design a MINE-based FJ scheme that can achieve comparable security performance to the conventional FJ methods that require perfect CSI. Extensive simulations in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system demonstrate that our proposed solution can effectively deal with eavesdropping attacks in various settings. Moreover, the proposed framework can seamlessly integrate MIMO security and detection tasks into a unified end-to-end learning process. This integrated approach can significantly maximize the throughput and minimize the block error rate, offering a good solution for enhancing communication security in wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$ (i.e., the maximum frequency of the measurements). In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit $\epsilon = \mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ given by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity of Near-Field Line-of-Sight Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The channel capacity of near-field (NF) communications is characterized by considering three types of line-of-sight multiuser channels: i) multiple access channel (MAC), ii) broadcast channel (BC), and iii) multicast channel (MC). For NF MAC and BC, closed-form expressions are derived for the sum-rate capacity as well as the capacity region under a two-user scenario. These results are further extended to scenarios with an arbitrary number of users. For NF MC, closed-form expressions are derived for the two-user channel capacity and the capacity upper bound with more users. Further insights are gleaned by exploring special cases, including scenarios with infinitely large array apertures, co-directional users, and linear arrays. For comparison, the MAC and BC sum-rates achieved by typical linear combiners and precoders are also analyzed. Theoretical and numerical results are presented and compared with far-field communications to demonstrate that: i) the NF capacity of these three channels converges to finite values rather than growing unboundedly as the number of array elements increases; ii) the capacity of the MAC and BC with co-directional users can be improved by using the additional range dimensions in NF channels to reduce inter-user interference (IUI); and iii) the MC capacity benefits less from the NF effect compared to the MAC and BC, as multicasting is less sensitive to IUI.</description>

The notions of transfer functions, spectrum gaps, bandlimitness, and low-pass filters are introduced for these signals.
  This allowed to obtain some frequency criteria for predictability and predictors for signals with a single point spectrum degeneracy and with sublinear rate of growth.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access for Sourced Massive Random Access with Finite Blocklength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For binary source transmission, this paper introduces the concept of element-pair (EP) and establishes that when the Cartesian product of $J$ distinct EPs satisfies the unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) structural property, these $J$ EPs can form a uniquely-decodable EP (UD-EP) code. EPs are treated as virtual resources allocated to different users in finite fields, serving to distinguish users. This approach enables the reordering of multiplexing and channel encoding modules, effectively addressing the finite blocklength (FBL) challenge in multiuser reliable transmission. Next, we introduce an orthogonal EP code $\Psi_{\rm o, B}$ constructed over an extension field GF($2^m$). Using this EP code, we develop a time-division mode of finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) systems, consisting of sparse-form and diagonal-form structures. Based on the diagonal-form (DF) structure, we present a specific configuration, referred to as polarization-adjusted DF-FFMA, which can simultaneously obtain the power gain and coding gain from the entire blocklength. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FFMA systems significantly improve error performance over a Gaussian multiple-access channel, compared to a slotted ALOHA system.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Exponential Generalization of the Laplace Transform of Poisson Shot Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Laplace transform of Poisson shot noise defined as an integral transform with respect to a matrix exponential. We denote this as the matrix Laplace transform and establish that it is in general a matrix function extension of the scalar Laplace transform. We show that the matrix Laplace transform of Poisson shot noise admits an expression analogous to that implied by Campbell's theorem. We demonstrate the utility of this generalization of Campbell's theorem in two important applications: the characterization of a Poisson shot noise process and the derivation of the complementary CDF (CCDF) and meta-distribution of signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) models in Poisson networks. In the former application, we demonstrate how the higher order moments of Poisson shot noise may be obtained directly from the elements of its matrix Laplace transform. We further show how the CCDF of this object may be bounded using a summation of the first row of its matrix Laplace transform. For the latter application, we show how the CCDF of SINR models with phase-type distributed desired signal power may be obtained via an expectation of the matrix Laplace transform of the interference and noise, analogous to the canonical case of SINR models with Rayleigh fading. Additionally, when the power of the desired signal is exponentially distributed, we establish that the meta-distribution may be obtained in terms of the limit of a sequence expressed in terms of the matrix Laplace transform of a related Poisson shot noise process.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS-Empowered Multiple Access: A Distributed Sum-Rate Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19334</link>

Abstract: The plethora of wirelessly connected devices, whose deployment density is expected to largely increase in the upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks, will naturally necessitate substantial advances in multiple access schemes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute a candidate 6G technology capable to offer dynamic over-the-air signal propagation programmability, which can be optimized for efficient non-orthogonal access of a multitude of devices. In this paper, we study the downlink of a wideband communication system comprising multiple multi-antenna Base Stations (BSs), each wishing to serve an associated single-antenna user via the assistance of a Beyond Diagonal (BD) and frequency-selective RIS. Under the assumption that each BS performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions and exclusively controls a distinct RIS, we focus on the sum-rate maximization problem and present a distributed joint design of the linear precoders at the BSs as well as the tunable capacitances and the switch selection matrices at the multiple BD RISs. The formulated non-convex design optimization problem is solved via successive concave approximation necessitating minimal cooperation among the BSs. Our extensive simulation results showcase the performance superiority of the proposed cooperative scheme over non-cooperation benchmarks, indicating the performance gains with BD RISs via the presented optimized frequency selective operation for various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Communication and Key Rate Region for Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with User Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14035</link>

Abstract: Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).</description>

      <title>Modular Learning of Deep Causal Generative Models for High-dimensional Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound and complete algorithms have been proposed to compute identifiable causal queries using the causal structure and data. However, most of these algorithms assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is impractical for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand, modern deep generative architectures can be trained to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However, training these networks are typically very costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose modular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes learning more efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional generative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is the first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training to learn the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders. With extensive experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines. We also show our algorithm's convergence on the COVIDx dataset and its utility with a causal invariant prediction problem on CelebA-HQ.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Matrix Denoising with Doubly Heteroscedastic Noise: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the matrix denoising problem of estimating the singular vectors of a rank-$1$ signal corrupted by noise with both column and row correlations. Existing works are either unable to pinpoint the exact asymptotic estimation error or, when they do so, the resulting approaches (e.g., based on whitening or singular value shrinkage) remain vastly suboptimal. On top of this, most of the literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular vector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided heteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the information-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly heteroscedastic noise. We characterize the exact asymptotic minimum mean square error, and design a novel spectral estimator with rigorous optimality guarantees: under a technical condition, it attains positive correlation with the signals whenever information-theoretically possible and, for one-sided heteroscedasticity, it also achieves the Bayes-optimal error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantage of our theoretically principled method with the state of the art. The proofs draw connections with statistical physics and approximate message passing, departing drastically from standard random matrix theory techniques.</description>

      <title>On the differential and Walsh spectra of $x^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power and let $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ be the finite field with $q^2$ elements. In this paper, we determine the differential spectrum of the power function $F(x)=x^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. When the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ is $3$, we also determine the value distribution of the Walsh spectrum of $F$, showing that it is $4$-valued, and use the obtained result to determine the weight distribution of a $4$-weight cyclic code.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. Combining this with our previous bound in \cite{yu2023phi}, we provide a computer-assisted proof for the Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>
