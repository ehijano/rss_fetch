      <title>Bipartite particle number fluctuations in dephased long-range lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of subsystem particle number fluctuations in a long-range system with power-law decaying hopping strength characterized by exponent $\mu$ and subjected to a local dephasing at every site. We introduce an efficient {\it bond length} representation for the four-point correlator, enabling the large-scale simulation of the dynamics of particle number fluctuations from translationally invariant initial states. Our results show that the particle number fluctuation dynamics exhibit one-parameter Family-Vicsek scaling, with superdiffusive scaling exponents for $\mu &lt; 1.5$ and diffusive scaling exponents for $\mu \geq 1.5$. Finally, exploiting the bond-length representation, we provide an exact analytical expression for the particle number fluctuations and their scaling exponents in the short-range limit ($\mu \to \infty)$.</description>

      <title>Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localization of entropy production in complex nanoscale processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localizing entropy production.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geq 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right and left half-lines. As shown by S. Chakraborti, A. Dhar, P. Krapivsky, SciPost Phys. 13 (2022) 074, an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geq 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Binding: a minimal model of protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe Structured Random Binding (SRB), a minimal model of protein-protein interactions rooted in the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, nonspecific binding is a generic consequence of the interaction between random proteins, exhibiting a phase transition from a high temperature state where nonspecific complexes are transient and lack well-defined interaction interfaces, to a low temperature state where the complex structure is frozen and a definite interaction interface is present. Numerically, weakly-bound nonspecific complexes can evolve into tightly-bound, highly specific complexes, but only if the structural correlation length along the peptide backbone is short; moreover, evolved tightly-bound homodimers favor the same interface structure that is predominant in real protein homodimers.</description>

      <title>The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., arXiv:2410.17029 (2024)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by a disordered interface. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.</description>

      <title>Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g.~the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fast, Modular, and Differentiable Framework for Machine Learning-Enhanced Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end differentiable molecular simulation framework (DIMOS) for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including particle-mesh Ewald electrostatics. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework bridges the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a PyTorch implementation. The superior performance and the high versatility is probed in different benchmarks and applications, with speed-up factors of up to $170\times$. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/nec-research/DIMOS.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>(Dis)continuous buckling transition in elastic shell mediated by contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snap-buckling is a rapid shape transition in slender structures, appearing as a fundamental switching mechanism of natural and man-made systems. Boundary conditions of structures are crucial to predict and control their snap-buckling behavior. However, the general framework that relates boundary conditions, geometry, and performance of structures is still absent to date. Here, we study the snap-buckling of hemispherical shells in contact with rigid cylinders of different diameters to uncover the roles of boundary conditions in the dynamic performance of shells. Specifically, we analyze the jumping dynamics of the pneumatically inverted shells placed on the rigid cylinder by combining experiments and analytical theory. We find the characteristic diameter classifying the snap-buckling and jumping dynamics into two: (i)~if the diameter of the cylinder is sufficiently larger than the characteristic diameter, the shell is regarded as in contact with the infinitely large flat plate, (ii)~if not, the cylinder is regarded as a point. The analytical predictions for the jumping performance of the shell supplemented with the characteristic diameter are in excellent agreement with our experimental results. Our study clarifies that contact geometry is crucial in predicting the pathway of snap-buckling, indicating that the dynamic performance of soft robots would be optimized by tuning their surface geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 &lt; d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.</description>

Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary matrix product state calculation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic heat differences between many-particle and density field descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates spatiotemporally discrete or continuous stochastic descriptions, where we focus on differences in heat naturally defined between the particle level and the density field. Both the descriptions are found to generally make the heat differences by the entropic term expressed just with the number density through spatial projection from the many particles' positions onto the density field. The transformation from the Langevin to Dean--Kawasaki equations is considered as the projection in the continuous descriptions, where the emergent heat differences undergo little temporal variations due to the sparse distributions of the point-particles. On the other hand, the analogous formalisms constructed in the discrete models may exhibit the explicit temporal evolutions of the entropic term. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the interpretation and applicability of the heat differences as well as the perspectives to many-polymer system.</description>

      <title>The quantum Mpemba effect in free-fermionic mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel probe to study symmetry breaking, known as entanglement asymmetry, has emerged and has been utilized to explore how symmetry is dynamically restored following quantum quenches. Interestingly, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, greater initial symmetry breaking leads to faster restoration, akin to a quantum Mpemba effect. This study focuses on investigating the effect of mixed initial states and non-unitary dynamics on symmetry restoration. The mixedness of a state can arise from different sources. We consider dephasing or dissipative processes affecting initial pure states or unitary dynamics of initially thermal states. In the former case, the stationary state after the quench is independent of the initial configuration, resembling the phenomenology of the classical Mpemba effect. Investigating the XY spin chain model, through a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we identify the conditions for the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. It turns out that this phenomenon still occurs in the presence of dissipation or at finite temperature, even though it will be eventually suppressed as the state becomes more mixed.</description>

      <title>Review and Prospect of Algebraic Research in Equivalent Framework between Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical equivalence between statistical mechanics and machine learning theory has been known since the 20th century, and research based on this equivalence has provided novel methodologies in both theoretical physics and statistical learning theory. It is well known that algebraic approaches in statistical mechanics such as operator algebra enable us to analyze phase transition phenomena mathematically. In this paper, we review and prospect algebraic research in machine learning theory for theoretical physicists who are interested in artificial intelligence.
  If a learning machine has a hierarchical structure or latent variables, then the random Hamiltonian cannot be expressed by any quadratic perturbation because it has singularities. To study an equilibrium state defined by such a singular random Hamiltonian, algebraic approaches are necessary to derive the asymptotic form of the free energy and the generalization error.
  We also introduce the most recent advance: the theoretical foundation for the alignment of artificial intelligence is now being constructed based on algebraic learning theory.
  This paper is devoted to the memory of Professor Huzihiro Araki who is a pioneering founder of algebraic research in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>Non-linear correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.</description>

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces. We use duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distribution of fluctuations of the trainable variables, using a toy model at learning equilibrium. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,2)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>
