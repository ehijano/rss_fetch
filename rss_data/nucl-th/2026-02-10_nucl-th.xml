      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Table of Calculated Huff Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic calculation of the Huff factor for nuclei with atomic numbers ($ Z $) in the range of $ 6 \leq Z \leq 94 $. The Huff factor quantifies the increase in the partial lifetime of the decay-in-orbit (DIO) of the muonic atom and serves as an essential correction factor for extracting the nuclear muon capture rate from the measured lifetimes of the muonic atom. However, previous calculations typically provided only the atomic number dependence and neglected isotope dependence -- an assumption whose reliability had not been examined, despite its importance for a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear muon capture rate. In this work, we calculate the Huff factor using nuclear charge distributions obtained from a fully self-consistent microscopic nuclear structure model that incorporates pairing and deformation effects. The resulting Huff factors exhibit a monotonic decrease with increasing $ Z $, while the isotope dependence is found to be small. Our results also show good agreement with previous calculations, supporting the reliability of the present framework. The comprehensive set of Huff factors presented here constitutes the first unified values currently available and will serve as a basis for future evaluations of muon nuclear data.</description>

      <title>New solution to the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars: Quantum many-body effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperon puzzle refers to the challenge of reconciling the existence of hyperons in neutron star cores and the observed high masses of neutron stars. The recent discovery of PSR J0952-0607 ($2.35\pm0.17 M_{\odot}$) has intensified this challenge. Existing solutions fail to achieve such a high mass, and often predict unrealistically fast cooling that is at odds with observations. Here, we propose a novel solution to the hyperon puzzle. Using the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, we incorporate the quantum many-body effects caused by strong baryon-meson interactions into the equation of state for cold baryonic matter and find it stiff enough to support a maximum hyperon-star mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2.59 M_{\odot}$, which can explain all the observed high neutron-star masses. The resulting proton and hyperon fractions are remarkably low, thus the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes are significantly suppressed. As a result, fast cooling typically does not occur in ordinary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Stochastic many-body perturbation theory for high-order calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order perturbative $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations are challenging due to the rapidly growing configuration space and the difficulty of assessing convergence. In this work, we introduce perturbation theory quantum Monte Carlo (PTQMC), a stochastic approach designed to compute high-order many-body perturbative corrections. By representing the perturbative wave function with random walkers in configuration space, PTQMC avoids the exponential scaling inherent to conventional constructions of high-rank excitation operators. Benchmark calculations for the Richardson pairing model demonstrate that PTQMC accurately reproduces exact many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) coefficients up to 16th order, even in strongly divergent regimes. We further show that combining PTQMC with series resummation techniques yields stable and precise energy estimates in cases where the straightforward perturbative series fails. Finally, we propose the effective number of configurations, $e^{S}$, as a global measure of perturbative wave-function complexity that can be directly extracted within PTQMC. We demonstrate that the saturation behavior of $e^{S}$ provides a more reliable indicator of the validity of perturbative expansions than energy convergence alone.</description>

      <title>Probing $\alpha$ clustering in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at CSR energies using the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of low-energy nuclear collisions to intrinsic nuclear structure by studying the interplay between initial-state geometry and final-state observables in C+C and C+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.36$~GeV, relevant for experiments at the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility in Lanzhou and forthcoming experiments at the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) in Huizhou. Calculations are performed within the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM) using Woods--Saxon and triangular $\alpha$-clustered configurations for the $^{12}C$ nucleus. The initial geometry is characterized in terms of transverse size, compactness, eccentricities, and their event-by-event fluctuations. We find that $\alpha$ clustering leads to a more compact participant configuration than the Woods--Saxon case, while transverse-size and eccentricity fluctuations show only weak sensitivity to clustering. At this beam energy, radial observables remain sensitive to geometric compactness, with the proton mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ enhanced for $\alpha$-clustered configurations, whereas pions show little sensitivity. The anisotropic response is examined using flow harmonic coefficients. We find an enhancement of the mean flow magnitudes, $\langle v_n \rangle = \sqrt{\langle v_n^2\rangle}$, for $\alpha$-clustered configurations at large $N_{part}$, while the event-by-event fluctuation strength of individual harmonics remains small. Symmetric cumulants of the initial-state eccentricities show sensitivity to clustering, whereas the corresponding correlations among final-state flow harmonics do not exhibit a comparably strong separation. These results indicate that radial observables and correlation-based flow measurements provide complementary probes of $\alpha$ clustering in low-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark--Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of a massless quark-gluon gas in chemical equilibrium including all $2\leftrightarrow 2$ cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical expressions of the shear viscosity of both one and two particle species with Boltzmann statistics and $2 \rightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings are known from the Chapman-Enskog method and have been shown to be quite accurate. The expression for a multi-species hadronic gas under $2 \rightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings is also known. Here we use the Chapman-Enskog method to derive the shear viscosity of a massless quark-gluon gas of $N_f$ quark flavors in chemical equilibrium subjected to all $2 \rightarrow 2$ parton scatterings including for the first time inelastic scatterings. We then verify the relation in a general single-species limit, where the shear viscosity of the quark-gluon gas should reduce to the result for a single particle species. In addition, we show the explicit analytical result in terms of the seven independent cross sections for the special case of isotropic and energy-independent cross sections. The analytical relations derived here can be useful for determining the shear viscosity of parton transport models with any $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering cross sections. They can also be coupled with finite temperature QCD cross sections to help study the shear viscosity of the quark gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: We review recent results of net-proton multiplicity fluctuations from STAR experiment, aiming to locate the QCD critical point in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. We show net-proton number cumulant and proton number factorial cumulant ratios up to fourth order using experimental data from RHIC BES-II Au+Au collisions in collider mode and fixed-target mode. The comparison is made between experimental data and non-critical model calculations from Lattice QCD, HRG, hydrodynamic simulations and transport model UrQMD. In addition, we discuss initial volume fluctuation effect, which plays significant role in fixed-target energies. Finally, an outlook on experimental research on the QCD critical point in future experiments will be presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical framework for many-fermion response and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Response functions are key observables for probing the structure and dynamics of many-body systems. We introduce and demonstrate a quantum-classical framework for computing response functions of general many-fermion systems that also provides the full bound-state spectrum. The framework employs the Lorentz integral transform and a new Hamiltonian input scheme that enables practical and scalable circuit constructions for general many-fermion Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we develop a hybrid strategy to evaluate the Lorentz integral and propose three protocols to extract response functions and bound-state structural information. As a demonstration, we apply the method to \({}^{19}\mathrm{O}\) with realistic internucleon interactions, computing both the bound-state spectrum and the response function. We envision that our approach will open new avenues for exploring the structure and dynamics of a broad class of many-body systems across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decays of hyperons in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays of spin-1/2 hyperons are investigated in a covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, extended by a $\Delta L=2$ operator proportional to the Majorana neutrino mass, where $L$ denotes the lepton number. Within the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, the decay amplitudes are found to emerge at the one-loop level, representing the long-range contribution. The extended-on-mass-shell scheme is employed to renormalize the one-loop amplitudes and restore consistent chiral power counting. Consequently, the differential decay rates for all accessible hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ channels are predicted and the corresponding branching ratios are more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds. Interestingly, it is found that the leading contribution to hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is actually from short-range counterterm operators, as required by the renormalization argument. Neutrinoless transition form factors are proposed to determine this leading contribution through future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of the Matter Radius of $^{132}$Sn via Proton Elastic Scattering at 200 MeV/Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The angular distribution of the differential cross sections for proton elastic scattering from $^{132}$Sn at 196-210 MeV/nucleon was successfully measured over a momentum transfer range of 0.80 to 2.1 fm$^{-1}$. Using a relativistic impulse approximation, the root-mean-square matter radius of $^{132}$Sn was extracted to be $4.758^{+0.023}_{-0.024}$ fm, which was compared with the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Combined with the charge radius measured at ISOLDE, there are no theoretical calculations consistent with both matter and charge radii within the experimental errors.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description>

      <title>Probing Nuclear Geometry through Multi-Particle Azimuthal Correlations and Rapidity-Even Dipolar Flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetric and asymmetric cumulants as well as rapidity-even dipolar flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV to explore $\alpha$-clustering phenomena in light nuclei within the viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework. Signatures of $\alpha$-clustering manifest in the anisotropic flow coefficients and their correlations -- particularly in observables involving elliptic-triangular flow correlations. We show that final-state symmetric and asymmetric cumulants -- especially $\mathrm{NSC}(2,3)$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{2,1}(2,3)$ -- are sensitive to the initial nuclear geometry. Additionally, we observe a significant difference in rapidity-even dipolar flow, $v_1^{\text{even}}$, between $\alpha$-clustered and Woods--Saxon configurations in high-multiplicity events. These findings underscore the pivotal role of nuclear structure in heavy-ion collision dynamics and provide observables for distinguishing nuclear geometries, particularly in ultra-central collisions.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charged hadrons in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic flow coefficient, $v_2$, for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$. Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic moments of ground and excited states calculated in heavy odd-N open-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within nuclear DFT, we calculated spectroscopic magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for various quasiparticle configurations of odd-$N$, even-$Z$, $83\leq{}N\leq125$ nuclei ranging from gadolinium to osmium. By tagging the blocked quasiparticles with single-particle states of the semi-magic dysprosium isotope, we efficiently computed 22 prolate and 22 oblate states for each of the 154 nuclei and tracked them across the entire major neutron shell. We compared this extensive set of theoretical results with experimental data for 82 states in the region. Breaking rotational, time-reversal, and signature symmetries, we aligned the intrinsic angular momenta along the axis of axial symmetry, thereby enabling full shape- and spin-self-consistent polarizations. The spectroscopic moments were then obtained by restoring rotational symmetry. We conducted a detailed analysis of the pattern of agreement and disagreement between theory and experiment in individual nuclei. For the magnetic dipole moments, agreement with the data varies and is characterized by an overall average and RMS deviation of 0.11 $\mu_N$ and 0.35 $\mu_N$, respectively. For the electric quadrupole moments, a good corresponding agreement of 0.16 b and 0.29 b was observed.</description>

      <title>Extracting Nucleon Resonance Transition GPDs from $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the process in which Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) excites a baryon resonance. In particular, we assess, in DVCS leading to the Roper resonance, the relative importance of a "background'' process in which a pion is first emitted by the nucleon, which then undergoes a DVCS event. Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin correlation between quarks during QCD confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry, signaled by the nonvanishing quark condensate $\langle q\bar{q}\rangle$, is dynamically generated through topologically nontrivial gauge configurations such as instantons. The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains a profound open question in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High energy proton-proton collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate. Here, we report evidence of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs inherited from spin-correlated strange quark-antiquark virtual pairs. Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>The N$^3$LO Twist-2 Matching of Helicity TMDs and SIDIS $q_\ast$ Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) helicity parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD. This calculation entails the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting functions govering the evolution of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). Within TMD factorization framework, we quantify the impact of radiative corrections by completing the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) prediction for lepton-hadron transverse momentum imbalance in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Our results provide the most precise theoretical input for probing the helicity structure and confined motion of quarks and gluons at future electron-ion collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Revisiting the first-order QCD phase transition in dense strong interaction matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which manifests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>Influence of Non-extensivity on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the drag and diffusion coefficients of various hadrons propagating through a hadronic thermal bath by employing the Fokker Planck equation within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\Gamma$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.</description>
