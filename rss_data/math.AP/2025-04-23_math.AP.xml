      <title>The existence and local uniqueness of the eigenfunctions of the non-linear operator $ \Delta_H u^{n}$ in the hyperbolic Poincar\'e half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we find locally an eigenfunctions for a particular nonlinear hyperbolic differential operator $\Delta_H u^{n}$, where $\Delta_H$ is the hyperbolic Laplacian in the half-plane of Poincair\'e. We have proved that these eigenfunctions are an analytic and non-exact whose coefficients satisfy a specific algebraic recursive rule. The existence of these eigenfunctions allows us to find non-exact solutions respecting the spatial coordinate of nonlinear diffusive PDEs on the Poincair\'e half-plane, which could describe a possible one-dimensional physical model.</description>

      <title>On evolutionary equations related to skew-symmetric spatial operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized solutions of an evolutionary equation related to some densely defined skew-symmetric operator in a real Hilbert space. We establish existence of a contractive semigroup, which provides generalized solutions, and suggest a criteria of uniqueness of this semigroup. We also find a stronger criteria of uniqueness of generalized solutions. Applications to transport equations with solenoidal (and generally discontinuous) coefficients are given.</description>

      <title>A positive solution of the elliptic equation on a starshaped domain with boundary singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic equation with boundary singularities \begin{equation} \begin{cases} -\Delta u=-\lambda |x|^{-s_{1}}|u|^{p-2}u+|x|^{-s_{2}}|u|^{q-2}u &amp;\text { in } \varOmega , u(x)=0 &amp;\text { on } \partial \varOmega , \end{cases} \end{equation} where $0\leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; 2$, $2&lt;p&lt; 2^{*}(s_1)$, $q&lt; 2^{*}(s_2)$. Which is the subcritical approximations of the Li-Lin's open problem proposed by Li and Lin (Arch Ration Mech Anal 203(3): 943-968, 2012). We find a positive solution which is a local minimum point of the energy functional on the Nehari manifold when $p&gt;q&gt;\frac{2-s_2}{2-s_1}p+\frac{2s_2-2s_1}{2-s_1}$. We also discuss the asymptotic behavior of the positive solution and find a new class of blow-up points by blowing up analysis. These blow-up points are on the boundary of the domain, which are not similar with the usual.</description>

      <title>Helically symmetric solution of 3D Euler equations with vorticity and its free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an incompressible steady free boundary problem of Euler equations with helical symmetry in $3$ dimensions and with nontrivial vorticity. The velocity field of the fluid arises from the spiral of its velocity within a cross-section, whose global existence, uniqueness and well-posedness with fixed boundary were established by a series of brilliant works. A perplexing issue, untouched in the literature, concerns the free boundary problem with (partial) unknown domain boundary in this helically symmetric configuration. We address this gap through the analysis of the optimal regularity property of the scalar stream function as a minimizer in a semilinear minimal problem, establishing the $C^{0,1}$-regularity of the minimizer, and the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of its free boundary. More specifically, the regularity results are obtained in arbitrary cross-sections through smooth helical transformation by virtue of variational method and the rule of "flatness implies $C^{1,\alpha}$".</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Biharmonic Model with $\Gamma$-Convergence to Local Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal models and their associated theories have been extensively investigated in recent years. Among these, nonlocal versions of the classical Laplace operator have attracted the most attention, while higher-order nonlocal operators have been studied far less. In this work, we focus on the nonlocal counterpart of the classical biharmonic operator together with clamped boundary condition ($u$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}$ are given on boundary). We develop the variational formulation of a nonlocal biharmonic model, establish the existence and uniqueness of its solution, and analyze its convergence as the nonlocal horizon approaches zero. In addition, numerical experiments are presented to further illustrate the analytical properties of the model and its solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear stability and transition threshold for the 3D Boussinesq system in Sobolev space under the high Reynolds number and small thermal diffusion in $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T} $. It is proved that if the initial velocity $v_{\rm in}$ and the initial temperature $ \theta_{\rm in} $ satisfy $ \|v_{\rm in}-(y,0,0)\|_{H^{2}}\leq \varepsilon\nu, \|\theta_{\rm in}\|_{H^{2}}\leq \varepsilon\nu^{2} $, respectively for some $ \varepsilon&gt;0 $ independent of the Reynolds number or thermal diffusion, then the solutions of 3D Boussinesq system are global in time.</description>

      <title>Mass-Critical Neutron Stars in the Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs in the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories. It is known that the system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational constant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical mass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].</description>

      <title>Solutions to the Thin Obstacle Problem with non-2D frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all odd positive integers $m$, we construct $\mu$-homogeneous solutions to the thin obstacle problem in $\mathbb{R}^3,$ with $\mu\in(m,m+1)$. For $m$ large, $\mu-m$ converges to $1$, so $\mu\neq m+\tfrac 1 2$. The restriction to odd values of $m$ is necessary: we show that, for all $n\ge 2$, there are no $\mu$-homogeneous solutions to the thin obstacle problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mu \in \bigcup_{k\ge 0}(2k,2k+1)$. These examples also apply to $2$-valued $C^{1,1/2}$ stationary harmonic functions or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the sphere.</description>

      <title>A new approach for the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through the theory of viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through a partial differential equation approach recently introduced for the real Dyson case. The main difference with the real Dyson case is that the spectrum is now on the circle and not on the real line, which leads to particular attention to comparison principles. First we recall why the system of particles which are the eigenvalues of unitary Dyson Brownian motion is well posed thanks to a containment function. Then we proved that the primitive of the limit spectral measure of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion is the unique solution to a viscosity equation obtained by primitive the Dyson equation on the circle. Finally, we study some properties of solutions of Dyson's equation on the circle. We prove a L $\infty$ regularization. We also look at the long time behaviour in law of a solution through a study of the so-called free entropy of the system. We conclude by discussing the uniform convergence towards the uniform measure on the circle of a solution of the Dyson equation.</description>

      <title>On existence of spatially regular strong solutions for a class of transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers existence of spatially regular solutions for a class of linear Boltzmann transport equations. The related transport problem is an (initial) inflow boundary value problem. This problem is characteristic with variable multiplicity, that is, the rank of the boundary matrix (here a scalar) is not constant on the boundary. It is known that for these types of (initial) boundary value problems the full higher order Sobolev regularity cannot generally be established. In this paper we present Sobolev regularity results for solutions of linear Boltzmann transport problems when the data belongs to appropriate anisotropic Sobolev spaces whose elements are zero on the inflow and characteristic parts of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Solvability of elliptic homogeneous linear equations with measure data in weighted Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A(D)$ be an elliptic homogeneous linear differential operator with complex constant coefficients, $ \mu $ be a vector-valued Borel measure and $w$ be a positive locally integrable function on $\mathbb{R}^N$. In this work, we present sufficient conditions on $\mu$ and $w$ for the existence of solutions in the weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^p_w$ for the equation $A^{*}(D)f=\mu$, for $ 1\leq p&lt;\infty $. Those conditions are related to a certain control of the Riesz potential of the measure $\mu$. We also present sufficient conditions for the solvability when $p=\infty$ adding a canceling condition on the operator. Our method is based on a new weighted $L^1$ Stein-Weiss type inequality on measures for a special class of vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier--Stokes equations without vacuum using the relative energy method.
  We present a novel and direct proof of the existence of weak solutions based on approximation with more regular solutions. The analysis we employ to justify the strong convergence reveals how to conclude the stability and uniqueness of weak solutions. To the best of our knowledge, these stability estimates are completely new. Furthermore, for the first time, we establish energy conservation for weak solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local exact controllability of the one-dimensional bilinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions has been extensively studied in subspaces of H 3 since the seminal work of K. Beauchard. Our first objective is to revisit this result and establish the controllability in H 1 0 for suitable discontinuous control potentials. In the second part, we consider the equation in the presence of periodic boundary conditions and a constant magnetic field. We prove the local exact controllability of periodic H 1 -states, thanks to a Zeeman-type effect induced by the magnetic field which decouples the resonant spectrum. Finally, we discuss open problems and partial results for the Neumann case and the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Small Alfv\'en Number Limit for the Global-in-time Solutions of Incompressible MHD Equations with General Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small Alfv\'en number (denoted by $\varepsilon$) limit (one type of large parameter limits, i.e. singular limits) in magnetohydrodynamic (abbr. MHD) equations was first proposed by Klainerman--Majda in (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 34: 481--524, 1981). Recently Ju--Wang--Xu mathematically verified that the \emph{local-in-time} solutions of three-dimensional (abbr. 3D) ideal (i.e. the absence of the dissipative terms) incompressible MHD equations with general initial data in $\mathbb{T}^3$ (i.e. a spatially periodic domain) tend to a solution of 2D ideal MHD equations in the distribution sense as $\varepsilon\to 0$ by Schochet's fast averaging method in (J. Differential Equations, 114: 476--512, 1994). In this paper, we revisit the small Alfv\'en number limit in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n=2$, $3$, and develop another approach, motivated by Cai--Lei's energy method in (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 228: 969--993, 2018), to establish a new conclusion that the \emph{global-in-time} solutions of incompressible MHD equations (including the viscous resistive case) with general initial data converge to zero as $\varepsilon\to 0$ for any given time-space variable $(x,t)$ with $t&gt;0$. In addition, we find that the large perturbation solutions and vanishing phenomenon of the nonlinear interactions also exist in the \emph{viscous resistive} MHD equations for small Alfv\'en numbers, and thus extend Bardos et al.'s results of the \emph{ideal} MHD equations in (Trans Am Math Soc 305: 175--191, 1988).</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, we construct solutions to the 3D Euler equations which dissipate kinetic energy with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity, such that the associated Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. The proof is based on the non-uniqueness of positive solutions to the corresponding transport equations, in conjunction with the superposition principle. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $1&lt;p&lt;2,\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{s}&gt;1+\frac1d$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $C_tL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,s}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics for the Kelvin-Helmholtz equations close to circular vortex sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kelvin-Helmholtz system describing the evolution of a vortex-sheet near the circular stationary solution. Answering previous numerical conjectures in the 90s physics literature, we prove an almost global existence result for small-amplitude solutions. We first establish the existence of a linear stability threshold for the Weber number, which represents the ratio between the square of the background velocity jump and the surface tension. Then, we prove that for almost all values of the Weber number below this threshold any small solution lives for almost all times, remaining close to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a remarkable stabilization phenomenon: the presence of both non-zero background velocity jump and capillarity effects enables to prevent nonlinear instability phenomena, despite the inherently unstable nature of the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. This long-time existence would not be achievable in a setting where capillarity alone provides linear stabilization, without the richer modulation induced by the velocity jump. Our proof exploits the Hamiltonian nature of the equations. Specifically, we employ Hamiltonian Birkhoff normal form techniques for quasi-linear systems together with a general approach for paralinearization of non-linear singular integral operators. This approach allows us to control resonances and quasi-resonances at arbitrary order, ensuring the desired long-time stability result.</description>

      <title>Fractional $Q$-curvature on the sphere and optimal partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal partition problem on the sphere, where the cost functional is associated with the fractional $Q$-curvature in terms of the conformal fractional Laplacian on the sphere. By leveraging symmetries, we prove the existence of a symmetric minimal partition through a variational approach. A key ingredient in our analysis is a new H\"older regularity result for symmetric functions in a fractional Sobolev space on the sphere. As a byproduct, we establish the existence of infinitely many solutions to a nonlocal weakly-coupled competitive system on the sphere that remain invariant under a group of conformal diffeomorphisms and we investigate the asymptotic behavior of least-energy solutions as the coupling parameters approach negative infinity.</description>

      <title>The CKN inequality for spinors: symmetry and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to Sobolev interpolation inequalities for spinors, with weights of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (CKN) type. In view of the corresponding results for scalar functions, a natural question is to determine whether optimal spinors have symmetry properties, or whether spinors with symmetry properties are linearly unstable, in which case we shall say that symmetry breaking occurs. What symmetry means has to be carefully defined and the overall picture turns out to be richer than in the scalar case. So far, no symmetrization technique is available in the spinorial case. We can however determine a range of the parameters for which symmetry holds using a detailed analysis based mostly on spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Crack Face Contact Modeling is Essential to Predict Crack-Parallel Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field fracture models provide a powerful approach to modeling fracture, potentially enabling the unguided prediction of crack growth in complex patterns. To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses drive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish between compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical shortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot distinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and crack-parallel stresses that do not.
  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our earlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel stresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic formulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past each other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces contact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two widely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric splitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical stress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur. Specifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth and stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses. However, our formulation, which resolves the crack-parallel stresses from the crack-normal stresses, predicts these correctly.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Transport Plans via Min-Max Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pose the Kantorovich optimal transport problem as a min-max problem with a Nash equilibrium that can be obtained dynamically via a two-player game, providing a framework for approximating optimal couplings. We prove convergence of the timescale-separated gradient descent dynamics to the optimal transport plan, and implement the gradient descent algorithm with a particle method, where the marginal constraints are enforced weakly using the KL divergence, automatically selecting a dynamical adaptation of the regularizer. The numerical results highlight the different advantages of using the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence versus the reverse KL divergence with this approach, opening the door for new methodologies.</description>

      <title>Solutions of the fractional 1-Laplacian: existence, asymptotics and flatness results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions of the equation $(-\Delta)_1^s u=f$ in a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary $\Omega\subset \Rn$, vanishing on $\Co \Omega$, for some given $s\in (0,1)$, and asymptotics as $p\to 1$ of solutions of $(-\Delta)_p^s u=f$. We obtain existence and convergence by comparing the $L^{\frac{n}{s}}$ norm of $f$ to the sharp fractional Sobolev constant, or, when $f$ is non-negative, the weighted fractional Cheegar constant to $1$ -- in this case, the results are sharp. We further prove that solutions are "flat" on sets of positive Lebesgue measure.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus our attention on the positive solutions to second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the form $u''+q(t)g(u)=0$, where $q$ is a sign-changing weight and $g$ is a superlinear function. We exploit the classical shooting approach and the comparison theorem to present non-degeneracy and exact multiplicity results for positive solutions. This completes the multiplicity results obtained by Feltrin and Zanolin. Numerical examples and some related open problems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A holographic global uniqueness in passive imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^3$. We show that the restriction of $\psi$ to any ray $L$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $\Im\psi$ on an interval of this ray. As a corollary, the restriction of $\psi$ to any plane $X$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by $\Im\psi$ on an open domain in this plane. These results have holographic prototypes in the recent work Novikov (2024, Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 325, 218-223). In particular, these and known results imply a holographic type global uniqueness in passive imaging and for the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem (from boundary values of the spectral measure in the whole space) in the monochromatic case. Some other surfaces for measurements instead of the planes $X$ are also considered.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of a Hele-Shaw-like system resulting from an inverse geometry problem formulated through a shape optimization setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we revisit a shape optimization reformulation of a prototypical shape inverse problem and briefly propose a simple yet efficient numerical approach for solving the corresponding minimization problem. Second, we examine the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of a classical solution to a Hele-Shaw-like system, which is derived from the continuous setting of a numerical discretization of the shape optimization reformulation for the shape inverse problem. The analysis is based on the methods developed by G. I. Bizhanova and V. A. Solonnikov in ``On Free Boundary Problems for Second Order Parabolic Equations" (Algebra Anal. 12 (6) (2000) 98-139), and by V. A. Solonnikov in ``Lectures on Evolution Free Boundary Problems: Classical Solutions" (Lect. Notes Math., Springer, 2003, pp. 123-175).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the setting of a locally compact, non-complete metric measure space $(Z,d,\nu)$ equipped with a doubling measure $\nu$, under the condition that the boundary $\partial Z:=\overline{Z}\setminus Z$ (obtained by considering the completion of $Z$) supports a Radon measure $\pi$ which is in a $\sigma$-codimensional relationship to $\nu$ for some $\sigma&gt;0$. We explore existence, uniqueness, comparison property, and stability properties of solutions to inhomogeneous Dirichlet problems associated with certain nonlinear nonlocal operators on $Z$. We also establish interior regularity of solutions when the inhomogeneity data is in an $L^q$-class for sufficiently large $q&gt;1$, and verify a Kellogg-type property when the inhomogeneity data vanishes and the Dirichlet data is continuous.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for compressible Euler Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the compressible isentropic Euler equations with a general pressure law. Using the developed Lagrangian formulation, we show a short-time solution which is unique in the framework of Bessel space $H_{p}^{\beta}(\mathbb{T}^{d})$ for $\beta&gt;\frac{d}{p}+1$. The proof is precise and relatively simple, relying on the application of the Implicit Function Theorem in Banach spaces combined with a carefully designed regularization procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Lagrangian formulation has been employed to show local wellposedness for compress ible Euler equations. Moreover, it can be adaptable to $C^{k,\alpha}$ spaces, Sobolev spaces, and notably, Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Paracomposition Operators and Paradifferential Reducibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducibility methods, aiming to simplify systems by conjugating them to those with constant coefficients, are crucial for studying the existence of quasiperiodic solutions. In KAM theory for PDEs, these methods help address the invertibility of linearized operators that arise in a Nash-Moser/KAM type scheme. The goal of this paper is to prove paradifferential reducibility results, enabling the reduction of nonlinear equations themselves, rather than just their linearizations, to constant coefficient form, modulo smoothing terms. As an initial application, we demonstrate the existence of quasiperiodic solutions for certain hyperbolic systems. Despite the small denominator problem, our proof does not rely on traditional Nash-Moser/KAM-type schemes, but instead on the Banach fixed point theorem. To achieve this, we develop two key toolsets. The first focuses on the calculus of paracomposition operators introduced by Alinhac, interpreted as the flow map of a paraproduct vector field. We refine this approach to establish new estimates that precisely capture the dependence on the diffeomorphism in question. The second toolset addresses two classical reducibility problems, one for matrix differential operators and the other for nearly parallel vector fields on torus. We resolve these problems by paralinearizing the conjugacy equation and exploiting, at the paradifferential level, the specific algebraic structure of conjugacy problems, akin to Zehnder's approximate Nash-Moser approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that E. De Giorgi's conjecture for the nonlocal approximation of free-discontinuity problems extends to the case of functionals defined in terms of the symmetric gradient of the admissible field. After introducing a suitable class of continuous finite-difference approximants, we show the compactness of deformations with equibounded energies, as well as their Gamma-convergence. The compactness analysis is a crucial hurdle, which we overcome by generalizing a Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov approach previously introduced by two of the authors. A second essential difficulty is the identification of the limiting space of admissible deformations, since a control on the directional variations is, a priori, only available in average. A limiting representation in GSBD is eventually established via a novel characterization of this space.</description>

      <title>Non-local non-homogeneous phase transitions: regularity of optimal profiles and sharp-interface limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a novel sharp-interface analysis via Gamma-convergence for a non-local and non-homogeneous diffuse-interface model for phase transitions, featuring an interplay between a non-local interaction kernel and a spatially dependent double-well potential. This interaction requires the development of new strategies both for the Gamma-liminf inequality and for the construction of recovery sequences. A key element of our approach is an asymptotic calibration, used to establish the Gamma-liminf lower bound. The study of the optimality of the lower bound hinges upon a novel analysis of the regularity dependence of one-dimensional optimal profiles on a family of parameters. In particular, we show how such regularity is influenced by the singularity of the interaction kernel at the origin, providing a precise and previously unexplored link between the two. Our results rely solely on the assumption of H\"older continuity for the moving wells, and also account for the compactness of sequences with equibounded energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the Stokes problem is well-posed when velocity and pressure simultaneously vanish on the domain boundary. This result is achieved by extending Ne\v{c}as' inequality to square-integrable functions that vanish in a small band covering the boundary. It is found that the associated a priori pressure estimate depends inversely on the volume of the band. Numerical experiments confirm these findings. Based on these results, guidelines are provided for applying vanishing pressure boundary conditions in model coupling and domain decomposition methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale behavior of Newton-Sobolev functions on complete, connected, proper, separable metric measure spaces equipped with a Borel measure $\mu$ with $\mu(X) = \infty$ and $0 &lt; \mu(B(x, r)) &lt; \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r \in (0, \infty)$ Our objective is to understand the relationship between the Dirichlet space $D^{1,p}(X)$, defined using upper gradients, and the Newton-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$, for $1\le p&lt;\infty$. We show that when $X$ is of uniformly locally $p$-controlled geometry, these two spaces do not coincide under a wide variety of geometric and potential theoretic conditions. We also show that when the metric measure space is the standard hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ with $n\ge 2$, these two spaces coincide precisely when $1\le p\le n-1$. We also provide additional characterizations of when a function in $D^{1,p}(X)$ is in $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$ in the case that the two spaces do not coincide.</description>

      <title>Learned enclosure method for experimental EIT data</title>

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Splitting Theorem for the $N$-Bakry \'Emery Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spectral generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem to smooth metric measure space. We show that if a complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifold $(M,g,e^{-f}\,dvolg)$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ has at least two ends where $f$ is smooth and bounded. If there is some $N\in (0,\infty)$ and $\gamma&lt;\left(\frac{1}{(n-1)\left(1 + \frac{n-1}{N}\right)} + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)^{-1}$ such that $$\lambda_1(-\gamma \Delta_f+\operatorname{Ric}^N_f)\ge 0$$then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb{R}\times X$ for some complete Riemannian manifold $X$ with $(\operatorname{Ric}_X)^N_f\ge 0$. The estimate can recover the spectral splitting result and its sharp constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ in Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu and and Catino--Mari--Mastrolia--Roncoroni.</description>
