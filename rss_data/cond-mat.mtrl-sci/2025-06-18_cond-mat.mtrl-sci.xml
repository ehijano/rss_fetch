      <title>Designing artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by altering the chain length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), as the most prominent lubrication additive, forms tribofilms consisting primarily of zinc phosphate glasses containing sulfides. As sulfur is linked to environmental concerns, sulfur-free zinc phosphate coatings have been sputtered from a Zn3(PO4)2 target and investigated here. Based on the bridging to non-bridging oxygen ratio, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as deposited coatings are classified as metaphosphates. As the annealing temperature is increased, the chain lengths are reduced, as witnessed by XPS data indicated by a loss of phosphorus and oxygen of the coating surface, likely due to hydrolysis with water from the atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scans show that the XPS-revealed composition change of the coating surface upon annealing occurs over the whole thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length reductions causes a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance. Therefore, the properties of the artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via a thermally stimulated composition change, causing an alternation in chain length from meta- to orthophosphate and thereby enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, distinct number of Weyl crossings arise under an appropriate symmetry breaking. We identify three sets of Weyl points by breaking the inversion symmetry in NiTe$_2$, resulting in a total of 28 Weyl crossings. The first set comes from the Dirac semimetal, whereas the other two additional sets depend on the weight of the symmetry breaking. The topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals have been investigated by computing the evolution of Wannier charge centers, providing their chiralities. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for manipulating and creating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale insights on grain boundary segregation in a cathode battery material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The grain boundary segregation of the Co-free pristine spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode material has been studied by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The segregation of Mn and the depletion of Ni at grain boundaries was observed by electron energy loss spectroscopy. These observations were also confirmed by atom probe tomography at other grain boundaries, which also revealed segregation of O and depletion of Li at grain boundaries. In addition, both methods revealed the occurrence of grain boundary segregation of Na, which is an impurity. Finally, segregation of O and Mn and a depletion of Li are also observed at dislocations. This observation has the potential to provide further support for the segregation behavior at the grain boundaries of this cathode material. These near-atomic-scale observations provide new insights that can be used to improve the synthesis and efficiency of Li-ion battery materials.</description>

      <title>Structural Inhomogeneities and Suppressed Magneto-Structural Coupling in Mn-Substituted GeCo2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of Ge1-xMnxCo2O4 (GMCO) system was conducted using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy, magnetometry, and heat capacity measurements. Comparative analysis with GeCo2O4 (GCO) highlights the influence of Mn substitution on the crystal and magnetic structure at low temperature. Surprisingly, phase separation is observed in GMCO with a targeted nominal composition of Ge0.5Mn0.5Co2O4. SEM/EDX analysis reveals that the sample predominantly consists of a Mn-rich primary phase with approximate stoichiometry Mn0.74Ge0.18Co2O4, along with a minor Ge-rich secondary phase of composition Ge0.91Mn0.19Co2O4. Although both GCO and GMCO crystallize in cubic symmetry at room temperature, a substantial difference in low-temperature structural properties has been observed. Magnetic and heat capacity data indicate ferrimagnetic ordering in the Mn-rich phase near TC = 108 K, while the Ge-rich phase exhibits antiferromagnetic order at TN = 22 K in GMCO. Analysis of heat capacity data reveals that the estimated magnetic entropy amounts to only 63% of the theoretical value expected in GMCO. A collinear ferrimagnetic arrangement is observed in the Mn rich phase below the magnetic ordering temperature, characterized by antiparallel spins of the Mn at A site and Co at B site along the c-direction. At 5 K, the refined magnetic moments are 2.31(3) for MnA and 1.82(3) uB for CoB in the Mn rich ferrimagnetic phase. The magnetic structure at 5 K in the Ge rich secondary phase is identical to the antiferromagnetic structure of the parent compound GeCo2O4. The refined value of the CoB moment in this phase at 5 K is 2.53(3) uB.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gate control and mitigating short channel effects in 20-50 nm channel length single-gate amorphous oxide Thin Film Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) with single gates are adversely affected by short channel effects such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and increases in the magnitude of sub-threshold swing as the channel length is reduced. Dual-gate and gate-all-around geometries are often employed to improve gate control in very short channel length transistors. This can introduce significant process complexity to the device fabrication compared to single-gate transistors. It is shown in this paper that substantial reductions in short channel effects are possible in single-gate field-effect transistors with indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductor channels by modifying the design of the source and drain electrodes to possess an array of tapered tips which are designated as nanospike electrodes. 20-25 nm channel length FETs with nanospike electrodes have DIBL and other key metrics that are comparable to those in much larger (70-80 nm) channel length FETs with a conventional source/drain electrode design. These improvements stem from better gate control near the source and drain electrode tips due to the shape of these electrodes. These bottom gate FETs had a gate insulator consisting of 9 nm thick Al2O3 and independent Ni gates. This design approach is expected to be very helpful for a variety of semiconductor technologies being considered for back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications.</description>

      <title>Isostructural electronic transition in MoS$_2$ probed by solid-state high harmonic generation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying materials under extreme pressure in diamond anvil cells (DACs) is key to discovering new states of matter, yet no method currently allows the direct measurement of the electronic structure in this environment. Solid-state high harmonic generation (sHHG) offers a new all-optical window into the electronic structure of materials. We demonstrate sHHG spectroscopy inside a DAC by probing $2H$-MoS$_2$, up to 30 GPa, revealing a pressure-induced crossover of the lowest direct bandgap from the $\textbf{K}$-point to the $\Gamma$-point. This transition manifests as a sharp minimum in harmonic intensity and a 30{\deg} rotation of the sHHG polarization anisotropy, despite the absence of a structural phase change. First-principles simulations attribute these features to interference between competing excitation pathways at distinct points in the Brillouin zone. Our results establish sHHG as a sensitive probe of electronic transitions at high pressure, enabling access to quantum phenomena that evade detection by conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Unraveling structural and magnetic information during growth of nanocrystalline SrFe12O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrothermal synthesis of magnetic strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) nanocrystallites was followed in situ using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. For all the studied temperatures, the formation of SrFe12O19 happened through an intermediate crystalline phase, identified as the so-called six-line ferrihydrite (FeOOH). The presence of FeOOH has been overlooked in previous studies on hydrothermally synthesized SrFe12O19, despite the phase having a non-trivial influence on the magnetic properties of the final material. The chemical synthesis was successfully reproduced ex situ in a custom-designed batch-type reactor that resembles the experimental conditions of the in situ setup, while allowing larger quantities of material to be produced. The agreement in phase composition between the two studies reveals comparability between both experimental setups. Hexagonal platelet morphology is confirmed for SrFe12O19 combining Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Room temperature magnetization curves were measured on the nanopowders prepared ex situ. The magnetic properties are discussed in the context of the influence of phase composition and crystallite size.</description>

      <title>A Spintronic Battery with Reversible Modulation of Spin Polarization through Li Charge/Discharge: A First Principles Computational Modelling Case Study for an Antiperovskite System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key notion defining the progress of the emergent fields of modern electronics, renewable energy, and smart systems is charge storage, which is primarily embodied in various battery chemistries and systems. In addition to the charge property, the electron also has the spin property, which is exploited in the field of spintronics to access novel magnetically controlled device actions that are not accessible to conventional electronics. An interesting question is whether the two can be fruitfully integrated into a single device concept to expand the horizon of device design and applications. Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of virgin and lithiated conducting intermetallic anti-perovskite with nominal stoichiometry represented as LixFe3SnC (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) to establish the principle of reversible and concurrent charge and spin polarization storage that can be aptly christened as Iono-Spintronics, representing a notion of a spintronic battery. The experimental results, however, showed that lithiation turns the system into a biphasic state comprised of tin-lithium alloy (due to the high affinity of Sn for Li) along with lithiated Fe3C. The process exhibits multiple cyclability (rechargeability).</description>

      <title>Polarization switching on the open surfaces of the wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides: ferroelectric subsystems and electrochemical reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary ferroelectric nitrides are promising materials for information technologies and power electronics. However, polarization switching in these materials is highly unusual. From the structural perspective, polarization reversal is associated with the change of the effective polarity at the surfaces and interfaces from N-to-M terminated, suggesting strong coupling between ferroelectric and chemical phenomena. Phenomenologically, macroscopic studies demonstrate the presence of complex time dependent phenomena including wake-up. Here, we explore the polarization switching using the multidimensional high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy, detecting both the evolution of induced ferroelectric domain, electromechanical response, and surface deformation during first-order reversal curve measurements. We demonstrate the presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems and the bias-induced electrochemical reactivity. The observed behaviors are very similar to the recent studies of other wurtzite system but additionally include electrochemical reactivity, suggesting the universality of these behaviors for the wurtzite binary ferroelectrics. These studies suggest potential of high-resolution multimodal PFM spectroscopies to resolve complex coupled polarization dynamics in materials. Furthermore, these PFM based studies are fully consistent with the recent electron microscopy observations of the shark-teeth like ferroelectric domains in nitrides. Hence, we believe that these studies establish the universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in binary wurtzite.</description>

      <title>In situ growth of a type-II ZnO/ZnS heterostructure:From stability to band-offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have successfully obtained a ZnO/ZnS heterostructure by heating a ZnS(001) single crystal in a controlled impurities-free oxygen atmosphere. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we explore the stability, electronic structure, and morphology of that interface. Our XPS measurements reveal a binding energy shift of the core-level peaks, indicating a band-bending effect due to the formation of a hybrid ZnO/ZnS interface. In addition, AFM measurements show that exposure of ZnS single-crystal to an oxygen atmosphere leads to the formation of ZnO/ZnS-like islands. Interestingly, our band-offset estimation suggest a type-II heterostructure arrangement with suitable electronic edges positions that turn ZnO/ZnS heterostructure a promising platform for catalytic applications, particularly hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Four-Phonon Scattering And Quantum Sampling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is a prototypical planar 2-dimensional system material and has been the subject of many investigations of its exceptional vibrational, spectroscopic and transport properties. The lattice thermal conductivity remains quite uncertain, with theoretical and experimental reports varying between 218 and 1060 Wm-1K-1. It has a strong temperature evolution and is sensitive to strain effects and isotope concentrations. While the impact of isotope scattering has been widely studied and is well understood, nuclear quantum effects and 4-phonon scattering have so far been neglected. Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is composed of light elements, and further has its 3-phonon scattering phase space restricted by mirror plane symmetry, so these effects may be of similar order as isotope scattering, and would lead to a completely different understanding of the fundamental processes limiting the lattice thermal conductivity for this system. In this work, we use both classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, in conjunction with the Temperature Dependent Effective Potential method, to compute temperature-dependent renormalized phonons including isotope scattering, 3-phonon scattering, 4-phonon scattering and nuclear quantum effects. We show the impact of the latter two on the lattice thermal conductivity for a large temperature range, as well as their impact on the phonon lifetimes. Overall, our work provides a robust framework for calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity in solids, providing quantitative improvements and physical understanding that help explain the variety of results found in the literature.</description>

      <title>250 Magnetic Tunnel Junctions-Based Probabilistic Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization, probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs) have gained significant attention for their acceleration of Monte Carlo sampling with the potential to reduce time-to-solution in finding approximate ground states. However, to be viable in real applications, further improvements in scalability and energy efficiency are necessary. One of the promising paths toward achieving this objective is the development of a co-design approach combining different technology layers including device, circuits and algorithms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fully connected PIM architecture based on 250 spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs), interfaced with an FPGA. Our computing approach integrates STT-MTJ-based tunable true random number generators with advanced annealing techniques, enabling the solution of problems with any topology and size. For sparsely connected graphs, the massive parallel architecture of our PIM enables a cluster parallel update method that overcomes the serial limitations of Gibbs sampling, leading to a 10 times acceleration without hardware changes. Furthermore, we prove experimentally that the simulated quantum annealing boosts solution quality 20 times over conventional simulated annealing while also increasing robustness to MTJ variability. Short pulse switching measurements indicate that STT-MTJ-based PIMs can potentially be 10 times faster and 10 times more energy-efficient than graphic processing units, which paves the way for future large-scale, high-performance, and energy-efficient unconventional computing hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency WSe$_2$ photovoltaics enabled by ultra-clean van der Waals contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors are interesting for photovoltaics owing to their high solar absorbance and efficient carrier diffusion. Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm. Our results suggest that ultra-clean vdW contacts on WSe$_2$ enable high-efficiency photovoltaics and form the foundation for further optimisation.</description>

      <title>Resolving Phonons in Superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} at Sub-Unit-Cell Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of phonons in cuprates remains controversial, with their complex lattice structure complicating the investigation. Here, we identify phonon modes originating from charge reservoir and superconducting layers of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} using sub-unit-cell resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We reveal several phonon modes exhibiting layer-specific localization: ~78 meV in-plane modes localized in the CuO2 planes, ~42 meV hybrid (in-plane and out-of-plane) modes in the CuO2 planes, and ~38 meV hybrid modes in the BiO layers. We also observe a periodic modulation of phonon frequencies induced by the superstructure, spatially correlating with the superconducting gap variation. Our findings offer new insights into the electron-phonon coupling in cuprates, fostering deeper exploration of the microscopic linkage between lattice dynamics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Noncentrosymmetric High-Temperature Superconductivity in doped $d^9$ Multiferroics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroics with $d^9$ electronic configurations, such as $SnCuO_2$, $PbCuO_2$, and $BiNiO_2$, exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetic order and ferroelectricity. Motivated by the fundamental link between symmetry breaking, strong electron correlations, and unconventional superconductivity, we propose a materials design strategy targeting noncentrosymmetric high-temperature superconductors through chemical doping of engineered $d^9$ multiferroics. This approach bridges two phenomena: (i) the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in correlated insulators, and (ii) the emergence of superconductivity in doped Mott/charge-transfer systems.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism is a rapidly developing field within magnetic materials research, where exploiting the third dimension unlocks opportunities for innovative applications in areas such as sensing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. Among various fabrication techniques, focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID) offers high flexibility in creating complex 3D nanostructures with sub-100 nm resolution. A key challenge in the development of 3D nanomagnets is the ability to locally control the magnetic configuration, which is essential to achieve desired functionalities. In this work, the magnetization reversal mechanism of a three-dimensional nanoarchitecture fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition is investigated by combining direct observation via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with finite element micromagnetic simulations. In particular, our investigation shows that the magnetization of the components of a three-dimensional Co3 Fe tetrapod can be reversed individually and sequentially. Finally, it is demonstrated that complete control and reconfigurability of the system can be achieved by tuning the direction of the applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Complex single-site magnetism and magnetotransport in single-crystalline Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of single-crystal samples of the magnetic compound Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$, which crystallizes in the $\alpha$-ThSi$_2$ type tetragonal structure. We report the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetoresistance for magnetic fields applied along both the tetragonal $c$-axis and in the basal $ab$-plane. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm a centrosymmetric, $I4_{1}/amd$ space group of the crystal structure. Despite single-site occupancy of the Gd position in this tetragonal structure, we identify two successive antiferromagnetic phase transitions at Ne\'el temperatures 32~K and 23~K via magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and transport measurements, as well as a complex magnetic interaction with a magnetic anisotropy that plays an important role in the direction-dependent transport response. Our identification of multiple magnetic phases in Gd$_{2}$AlSi$_{3}$, where Gd is the only magnetic species, helps to elucidate the field-induced skyrmionic behavior in the Gd-based intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles and semiclassical analysis of the puzzling observation that a La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film exhibits larger Gilbert damping than an LSMO/Pt bilayer, contrary to conventional spin-pumping expectations. Density-functional theory with Wannier interpolation yields an intrinsic damping for LSMO, which is smaller than that of LSMO/Pt, indicating that the observed high damping in LSMO must be extrinsic. Motivated by the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) reported by Gupta et al [Phys. Rev. B 109, 014437 (2024)], we show that LSMO's large spin Hall angle (~0.093) and low longitudinal conductivity facilitate efficient spin-to-charge conversion, enhancing damping. In contrast, Pt capping in LSMO/Pt increases longitudinal conductivity and suppresses interfacial spin Hall angle to 0.007, reducing spin-pumping-induced damping. A Valet-Fert analysis of the spin accumulation yields the spin-diffusion length in Pt and a finite anti-damping spin-orbit torque coefficient. Our findings reconcile the anomalous damping hierarchy and offer design rules for low-loss manganite heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven materials design. While most descriptors of crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. Here, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress electron densities into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance materials design.</description>

      <title>Grotthuss-type oxygen hole polaron transport in desodiated Na$_{2}$Mn$_3$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the coupling of electrons or holes with ionic vibrations in polarizable materials. Typically, they are either localized at a single atomic site or delocalized over multiple sites. However, after the desodiation of Na$_{2}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, we identify a rare split-hole polaron, where a single hole is shared between two adjacent oxygen atoms rather than fully localized or delocalized. We present a density functional theory (DFT) study on the migration and transport properties of these oxygen hole polarons in NaMn$_{3}$O$_{7}$ and Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$. Our calculations reveal that the split polaron configuration near a sodium vacancy is the ground state, while the localized polaron acts as the transition state. Migration occurs via a stepwise charge transfer mechanism along the $b$-axis, where the split-hole polaron transitions through a localized hole state. This transport behavior closely resembles the Grotthuss mechanism, which describes proton transport in H$_{2}$O. We compute the polaron mobility as $\mu$ = 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s) with an energy barrier of 242 meV. Using the Mulliken-Hush theory, we determine the electronic coupling parameter $V_{AB}$ = 0.87 eV. A similar migration mechanism is observed in Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, where the split polaron remains more stable than in the localized state. This study provides the first theoretical investigation of split-hole polaron migration, offering new insights into the charge transport of exotic polaronic species in materials with implications for a wide range of functional materials including battery cathodes, thermoelectrics, photocatalysts, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ab initio molecular dynamics of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using disordered local moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an investigation of the thermophysical properties of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) approach. This methodology accurately captures the high-temperature paramagnetic state of UN, addressing the limitations of standard density functional theory (DFT) models. The AIMD+DLM model consistently predicts a cubic crystal structure for UN across all considered temperatures, aligning with experimental observations of its paramagnetic phase. Key thermophysical properties, including the lattice parameter and specific heat capacity, are computed and compared to experimental data. The calculated lattice parameter is somewhat underestimated relative to the empirical correlation, consistent with prior studies modeling UN as a ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) material. The specific heat capacity exhibits overestimation at low temperatures (300--500 K) and slight underestimation at higher temperatures, while closely following the experimental trend. These results highlight the accuracy and utility of the AIMD+DLM framework in modeling paramagnetic materials, which can offer insights into the influence of the magnetic state on the behavior of nuclear fuels at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Electron correlations in the kagome flat band metal $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic orders but also quantum criticality. Very recently, $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$. The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$ orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band, concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study surface states and domain wall bound states in altermagnets using a rutile-lattice tight-binding model of electrons coupled to a N\'eel order. We discover that two symmetry-protected Weyl nodal lines in the bulk band structure can give rise to unconventional anti-chiral surface states -- surface states from opposite surfaces propagate in a \emph{parallel} manner, as opposed to the anti-parallel manner for the more conventional chiral surface states. We also find that the anti-chiral surface states can be turned into chiral surface states upon changing the surface termination. The origin of the surface states, the dependence on the surface termination, and key features of domain wall bound states are explained using a map from the altermagnet to a family of a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) chain and the associated bulk-boundary correspondence. Our work reveals rutile altermagnets as a promising candidate among very few quantum materials that can support anti-chiral surface states.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Topology Optimization using Modulated Neural Fields (TOM) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate TOM on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results show that TOM generates more diverse solutions than any previous method, all while maintaining near-optimality and without relying on a dataset. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spin systems, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This is done by deriving an effective magnetic field from the quantum partition function of the system to use in classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations and generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)]. In special cases where the effective field can be computed exactly we compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. We show that our method works well across a large temperature range and can reproduce quantum expectation values for antiferromagnetic coupling which is usually not possible with classical models.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice entanglement in $\mathbf{CoPS}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</description>
