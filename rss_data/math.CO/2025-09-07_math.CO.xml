      <title>Existence and bounds of growth constants for restricted walks, surfaces, and generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce classes of restricted walks, surfaces and their generalisations. For example, self-osculating walks (SOWs) are supersets of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) where edges are still not allowed to cross but may 'kiss' at a vertex. They are analogous to osculating polygons introduced in (Jensen and Guttmann, 1998) except that they are not required to be closed. The 'automata' method of (P\"onitz and Tittmann, 2000) can be adapted to such restricted walks. For example, we prove upper bounds for the connective constant for SOWs on the square and triangular lattices to be $\mu^{\mathrm{SOW}}_\square \leq 2.73911$ and $\mu^{\mathrm{SOW}}_\triangle \leq 4.44931$, respectively. In analogy, we also introduce self-osculating surfaces (SOSs), a superset of self-avoiding surfaces (SASs) which can be generated from fixed polyominoids (XDs). We further generalise and define self-avoiding $k$-manifolds (SAMs) and its supersets, self-osculating $k$-manifolds (SOMs) in the $d$-dim hypercubic lattice and $(d, k)$-XDs. By adapting the concatenation procedure procedure (van Rensburg and Whittington, 1989), we prove that their growth constants exist, and prove an explicit form for their upper and lower bounds. The upper bounds can be improved by adapting the 'twig' method, originally developed for polyominoes (Eden, 1961, Klarner and Rivest, 1973). For the cubic lattice, we find improved upper bounds for the growth constant of SASs as $\mu^{\mathrm{SAS}}_{\mathbb{Z}^3} \leq 17.11728$.</description>

      <title>Perfect Edge Domination in $P_6$-free Graphs and in Graphs Without Efficient Edge Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge of a graph dominates itself along with any edge that shares an endpoint with it. An efficient edge dominating set (also called a dominating induced matching, DIM) is a subset of edges such that each edge of the graph is dominated by exactly one edge in the subset. A perfect edge dominating set is a subset of edges in which every edge outside the subset is dominated by exactly one edge within it. In this article, we establish the NP-completeness of deciding whether a graph that does not admit any efficient edge dominating set has at least two perfect edge dominating sets. We also present a cubic time algorithm designed to identify a perfect dominating set of minimal cardinality for $P_6$-free graphs. Moreover, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to handle the weighted version of the problem and to count all perfect edge dominating sets as well as DIMs in a given graph, while preserving the same time complexity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cluster algebras over $\mathbb{F}_2$. By the Laurent phenomenon there is a map from the set of seeds of the cluster algebra to the corresponding cluster variety. We show that in type $A$, fibers of this map can be described in terms of certain edges of the universal polytope of triangulations of a polygon. Moreover, we show that there is a section of this map giving seeds whose corresponding cluster tori cover the cluster manifold over any field $\mathbb{F}$, but there are also sections giving seeds whose cluster tori do not cover the cluster manifold over any field $\mathbb{F} \not\cong \mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic measure of width for convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the arithmetic width of a convex body, defined as the number of distinct values a linear functional attains on the lattice points within the body. Arithmetic width refines lattice width by detecting gaps in the lattice point distribution and always provides a natural lower bound. We show that for large dilates of a convex body, the attained values form an arithmetic progression with only a bounded number of omissions near the extremes. For rational polytopes, we show that the arithmetic width grows eventually quasilinearly in the dilation parameter, with optimal directions reoccurring periodically. Lastly, we present algorithms to compute the arithmetic width. These results build new connections with discrete geometry, integer programming, and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pete discovered a strong combinatorial description of hitomezashi loops via a bijection to pairs of Dyck paths of the same height. Our main theorem provides an analogous description of hitomezashi loops of nonzero homology class on certain cylindrical hitomezashi patterns. In the process, we complete some of Ren and Zhang's results on the count and possible homology classes of toroidal hitomezashi loops.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial games and the golden ratio on digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new combinatorial game, named Triangle Game. In this game, a directed $3$-cycle graph is given, and tokens are placed on each vertex. The player chooses an edge and takes at least one token from the initial vertex. At the same time, the player is allowed to return some tokens to the terminal vertex of the edge, as far as the total number of the tokens decreases. We describe the set of \Pps~under both normal play and mis\`ere play. The golden ratio $\phi=\dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ plays an essential role in our description.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of digraphs with local edge structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classical topics in graph Ramsey theory is the study of which $n$-vertex graphs have Ramsey numbers that are linear in $n$. In this paper, we consider this problem in the context of directed graphs. The oriented Ramsey number of a digraph $G$ is the smallest integer $N$ such that every $N$-vertex tournament contains a copy of $G$. We prove that every bounded-degree acyclic digraph with a ``local edge structure'' has a linear oriented Ramsey number.
  More precisely, we say that a digraph $G$ has graded bandwidth $w$ if its vertices can be partitioned into sets $V_1, \dots, V_H$ such that all edges $uv \in E(G)$ with $u \in V_i$ and $v \in V_j$ satisfy $1 \leq j - i \leq w$. We prove that $\vec{r}(G) \leq 3^{57\Delta w} |V(G)|$ for any acyclic $G$ with graded bandwidth $w$ and maximum degree $\Delta$.
  This provides a common generalization of several prior results, including on digraphs of bounded height, of digraphs of bounded bandwidth, and blowups of bounded-degree oriented trees. This notion also captures a wide variety of natural digraphs, such as oriented grids and hypercubes.</description>

      <title>The Game of Graph Nim on graphs with four edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the study of the Game of Graph Nim -- a class of two-player combinatorial games -- on graphs with $4$ edges. To each edge of such a graph is assigned a positive-integer-valued edge-weight, and during each round of the game, the player whose turn it is to make a move selects a vertex, and removes a non-negative integer edge-weight from each of the edges incident on that vertex, such that the remaining edge-weight on each of these edges is a non-negative integer, and the total edge-weight removed during a round is strictly positive. The game continues for as long as the sum of the edge-weights remaining on all edges of the graph is strictly positive, and the player who plays the last round wins. An initial configuration of edge-weights is considered winning if the player who plays the first round wins the game, whereas it is defined as losing if the player who plays the second round wins. In this paper, we characterize, almost entirely, all winning and losing configurations for this game on all graphs with precisely $4$ edges each. Only one such graph defies our attempt to fully characterize the winning and losing configurations of edge-weights on its edges -- we are still able to provide a significant set of partial results pertaining to this graph.</description>

      <title>Subgroup perfect codes of $S_n$ in Cayley sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent, and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. Let $ G $ be a finite group, and let $ S $ be a square-free normal subset of $ G $. The Cayley sum graph of $ G $ with respect to $ S $ is a simple graph with vertex set $ G $ and two vertices $ x $ and $ y $ are adjacent if $ xy\in S .$ A subset $ C $ of $ G $ is called perfect code of $ G $ if there exists a Cayley sum graph of $ G $ that admits $ C $ as a perfect code. In particular, if a subgroup of $ G $ is a perfect code of $ G $, then the subgroup is called a subgroup perfect code of $ G $. In this work, we prove that there does not exist any proper perfect subgroup code of symmetric group $ S_n $. Using this result, we provide a complete characterization of the perfect subgroup code of the alternating group $A_n$.</description>

      <title>Constructions for positional games and applications to domination games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constructions regarding the general behaviour of biased positional games, and amongst others show that the outcome of such a game can differ in an arbitrary way depending on which player starts the game, and that fair biased games can behave highly non-monotonic. We construct a gadget that helps to transfer such results to Maker-Breaker domination games, and by this we extend a recent result by Gledel, Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, and Klav\v{z}ar, regarding the length of such games. Additionally, we introduce Waiter-Client dominations games, give tight results when they are played on trees or cycles, and using our transference gadget we show that in general the length of such games can differ arbitrarily from the length of their Maker-Breaker analogue.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and local weak convergence of sparse random uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of local weak convergence, also known as Benjamini--Schramm convergence, was introduced by Benjamini and Schramm \cite{Benjamini-Schramm-convergence}. It is known that the local weak limit of sparse Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs is the Galton--Watson measure with Poisson offspring almost surely. Recently, Adhikari, Kumar and Saha \cite{adhikari2023spectrumrandomsimplicialcomplexes} showed that the local weak limit of the line graph of sparse Linial--Meshulam complexes is the $d$-block Galton--Watson measure almost surely. In this work, we study the local weak convergence of a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform random hypergraphs.
  Let $H(n,k,p)$ denote the $k$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices, where each $k$-set of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with probability $p$. For $1\le r\le k-1$, the $r$-set weighted line graph of $H=(V,E)$ is $G_r(H)=(\mathcal V_r,\mathcal E_r,w_H)$, with \[ \mathcal V_r=\l[\binom{n}{r}\r],\;\; \mathcal E_r=\{\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}\suchthat \tau_1,\tau_2\in\mathcal V_r, \exists e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}, \] and $w_H(\{\tau_1,\tau_2\})=|\{e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}|$. In particular, $G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs, while $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the line graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if $\binom{n-r}{k-r}\to \lambda$ as $n\to\infty$, then the local weak limit of $G_r(H_n)$ is the $(\binom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with Poisson$(\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the limiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding connected colorings and orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study network robustness under correlated failures modeled by colors, where each color represents a class of edges or vertices that may fail simultaneously. An edge-colored graph is said to be edge-color-avoiding $k$-edge-connected if it remains $k$-edge-connected after the removal of all edges of any single color. We characterize the graphs that admit such a coloring and show that, when $k = 1$, one can determine in polynomial time both the minimum number of colors required and a coloring achieving it; while the problem becomes NP-hard for $k \ge 2$. We also investigate the problem of orienting the edges of a graph so that the resulting digraph remains strongly or rooted connected even after the removal of all arcs of any single color. In addition, we explore generalizations involving vertex-colorings, $k$-vertex-connectivity, simultaneous failures of multiple colors and matroids.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrences from Counting Schreier-Type Multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonempty set $F$ is Schreier if $\min F\ge |F|$. Bird observed that counting Schreier sets in a certain way produces the Fibonacci sequence. Since then, various connections between variants of Schreier sets and well-known sequences have been discovered. Building on these works, we prove a linear recurrence for the sequence that counts multisets $F$ with $\min F\ge p|F|$. In particular, if we let $$\mathcal{A}^{(s)}_{p, n}\ :=\ \{F\subset \{\underbrace{1, \ldots, 1}_{s}, \ldots, \underbrace{n-1, \ldots, n-1}_{s}, n\}\,:\,n\in F\mbox{ and }\min F\ge p|F|\},$$ then $$|\mathcal{A}^{(s)}_{p, n}| = \sum_{i=0}^s|\mathcal{A}^{(s)}_{p, n-1-ip}|.$$ If we color $s$ copies of the same integer by different colors from $1$ to $s$, i.e., $\mathcal{B}^{(s)}_{p, n}:= $ $$\{F\subset \{1_{1}, \ldots, 1_{s}, \ldots, (n-1)_1, \ldots, (n-1)_{s}, n\}\,:\,n\in F\mbox{ and }\min F\ge p|F|\},$$ then $$|\mathcal{B}^{(s)}_{p, n}|  = \sum_{i=0}^s \binom{s}{i}| \mathcal{B}^{(s)}_{p, n-1-ip}|.$$ Lastly, we count Schreier sets that do not admit multiples of a given integer $u\ge 2$ and witness linear recurrences whose coefficients are drawn from the $u$th row of the Pascal triangle and have alternating signs, except possibly the last one.</description>

      <title>Limited-visibility Cops and Robbers on Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classic game of Cops and Robbers, a team of cops pursues a robber through a graph. The traditional model of Cops and Robbers operates under the assumption that the cops know the robber's location at all times. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in models wherein the cops have only partial information about the robber's location. In this paper, we study the limited-visibility variant of Cops and Robbers, in which the cops only know the robber's position if some cop is within a fixed distance of the robber. For this variant of the game, we give bounds on the number of cops needed to capture a robber on Hamming graphs, and we use these results to settle several open problems posed by Clarke et al.</description>

      <title>Vertex-ordering and arc-partitioning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vertex-ordering problems in loop-free digraphs subject to constraints on the left-going arcs, focusing on existence conditions and computational complexity. As an intriguing special case, we explore vertex-specific lower and upper bounds on the left-outdegrees and right-indegrees. We show, for example, that deciding whether the left-going arcs can form an in-branching is solvable in polynomial time and provide a necessary and sufficient condition, while the analogous problem for an in-arborescence turns out to be NP-complete. We also consider a weighted variant that enforces vertex-specific lower and upper bounds on the weighted left-outdegrees, which is particularly relevant in applications. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between ordering problems and their arc-partitioning counterparts, where one seeks to partition the arcs into a subgraph from a specific digraph family and an acyclic subgraph -- equivalently, one seeks to cover all directed cycles with a subgraph belonging to a specific family. For the family of in-branchings, unions of disjoint dipaths, and matchings, the two formulations coincide, whereas for in-arborescences, dipaths, Hamiltonian dipaths, and perfect matchings the formulations diverge. Our results yield a comprehensive complexity landscape, unify diverse special cases and variants, clarify the algorithmic boundaries of ordered digraphs, and relate them to broader topics including graph degeneracy, acyclic orientations, influence propagation, and rank aggregation.</description>

      <title>On the Graham--Sloane harmonious labelling conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an order $n$ abelian group $G$ and a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. When is it possible to (bijectively) label $V(T)$ by $G$ so that along all edges $xy$ of $T$, the sums $x+y$ are distinct? This problem can be traced back to the work of Graham and Sloane on the harmonious labelling conjecture, and has been studied extensively since its introduction in 1980. We give a precise characterisation that holds for all bounded degree trees. In particular, our characterisation implies that if $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $T$ is a bounded degree tree, the desired labelling exists. This confirms a conjecture of Graham and Sloane from 1980, and another conjecture of Chang, Hsu, and Rogers from 1987, for bounded degree trees. Our results also have further applications for the study of graph coverings.</description>

      <title>A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one. Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound. We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing problem.</description>

      <title>A Higgs category for the cluster variety of triples of flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</description>

      <title>Low degree sum-of-squares bounds for the stability number: a copositive approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability number of a graph $G$, denoted as $\alpha(G)$, is the maximum size of an independent (stable) set in $G$. Semidefinite programming (SDP) methods, which originated from Lov\'asz's theta number and expanded through lift-and-project hierarchies as well as sums of squares (SOS) relaxations, provide powerful tools for approximating $\alpha(G)$.
  We build upon the copositive formulation of $\alpha(G)$ and introduce a novel SDP-based hierarchy of inner approximations to the copositive cone COP$_n$, which is derived from structured SOS representations. This hierarchy preserves essential structural properties that are missing in existing approaches, offers an SDP feasibility formulation at each level despite its non-convexity, and converges finitely to $\alpha(G)$. Our results include examples of graph families that require at least $\alpha(G) - 1$ levels for related hierarchies, indicating the tightness of the de Klerk-Pasechnik conjecture. Notably, on those graph families, our hierarchy achieves $\alpha(G)$ in a single step.</description>

      <title>Revealing the building blocks of tree balance: fundamental units of the Sackin and Colless Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, more than 25 phylogenetic tree balance indices and several families of such indices have been proposed in the literature -- some of which even contain infinitely many members. It is well established that different indices have different strengths and perform unequally across application scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability of an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies significantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the ongoing search for new and possibly \enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An easy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a linear combination of established indices.
  Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context are the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these classic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into more elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties of a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus Sackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by all Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless forms a balance index.
  Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless indices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is another index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary building blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices but also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing the balance of different trees.</description>

      <title>Capturing an Invisible Robber using Separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-visibility cops and robbers game, where the robber is invisible to the cops until they are caught. This differs from the classic game where full information about the robber's location is known at any time. A previously known solution for capturing a robber in the zero-visibility case is based on the pathwidth decomposition. We provide an alternative solution based on a separation hierarchy, improving capture time and space complexity without asymptotically increasing the zero-visibility cop number in most cases. In addition, we provide a better bound on the approximate zero-visibility cop number for various classes of graphs, where approximate refers to the restriction to polynomial time computable strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1608.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any graph $G$, we define the power $\pi(G)$ as the minimum of the largest number of neighbors in a $\gamma$-set of $G$, of any vertex, taken over all $\gamma$-sets of $G$. We show that $\gamma(G\square H)\geq \frac{\pi(G)}{2\pi(G) -1}\gamma(G)\gamma(H)$. Our methods allow us to prove the following statements for any graphs $G$ and $H$, (1) $\gamma(G\square H)\geq \frac{\lceil \frac{\gamma (G)}{2}\rceil}{2\lceil \frac{\gamma (G)}{2}\rceil-1}\gamma(G)\gamma(H)$ for odd $\gamma(G)$, (2) $\gamma(G\square H)\geq \frac{\gamma (G)}{2\gamma (G)-2}\gamma(G)\gamma(H)$, for even $\gamma(G)$, and (3) a short proof of Vizing's conjecture where $\gamma(G)=3$. Our argument relies on establishing efficient correspondences between dominating vertices and subsets of their neighborhoods and then showing a sufficient number of dominating vertices that horizontally dominate vertically undominated cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the classic definition of Delaunay triangulation and prove that for a locally finite and coarsely dense generic point set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the $d$-simplices whose vertices belong to $A$ and whose circumscribed spheres enclose exactly $k$ points of $A$ cover $\mathbb{R}^d$ exactly $\binom{d+k}{d}$ times. Similarly, the subset of such simplices incident to a point in $A$ cover any small enough neighborhood of that point exactly $\binom{d+k-1}{d-1}$ times. We extend this result to the cases in which the points are weighted and when $A$ contains only finitely many points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or in $\mathbb{S}^d$. Using these results, we give new proofs of classic results on $k$-facets, old and new combinatorial results for hyperplane arrangements, and a new proof for the fact that the volumes of hypersimplices are Eulerian numbers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a coarse analogue of treewidth. We prove that a graph $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which each bag is contained in the union of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius, if and only if $G$ admits a quasi-isometry to a graph with bounded tree-width. (The ``if'' half is easy, but the ``only if'' half is challenging.) This generalizes a recent result of Berger and Seymour, concerning tree-decompositions when each bag has bounded radius.</description>

Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$ is called complete if it is not contained in a larger $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$. In this paper, we classify $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear complete symmetric rank-distance (CSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ up to equivalence. This includes the classification of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear maximum symmetric rank-distance (MSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Our approach is mainly geometric, and our results contribute towards the classification of nets of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the topological persistence of the (path) configuration spaces and the (path) independence complexes for digraphs as well as their underlying graphs. We construct some canonical embeddings from the (path) independence complexes of the underlying graphs to the (path) independence complexes of the digraphs as well as some canonical embeddings between the (path) independence complexes induced by strong totally geodesic immersions and strong totally geodesic embeddings of (di)graphs. We apply the path homology to the path independence complexes of (di)graphs. As by-products, we derive some consequences about the Shannon capacities.</description>

      <title>Words avoiding the morphic images of most of their factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a finite factor $f$ of a word $w$ is \emph{imaged} if there exists a non-erasing morphism $m$, distinct from the identity, such that $w$ contains $m(f)$. We show that every infinite word contains an imaged factor of length at least 6 and that 6 is best possible. We show that every infinite binary word contains at least 36 distinct imaged factors and that 36 is best possible.</description>

      <title>The burning number conjecture holds for trees of order $n$ with at most $\left\lfloor \sqrt{n-1}\right\rfloor$ degree-2 vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the spread of information in social networks and graph-theoretic processes such as Firefighting and graph cleaning, Bonato, Janssen and Roshanbin introduced in 2016 the burning number $b(G)$ of any finite graph $G$. They conjectured that $b(G)\le \lceil n^\frac{1}{2}\rceil$ holds for all connected graphs $G$ of order $n$, and observed that it suffices to prove the conjecture for all trees. In 2024, Murakami confirmed the conjecture for trees without degree-2 vertices. In this paper, we prove that for all trees $T$ of order $n$ with $n_2$ degree-2 vertices, $$b(T)\le \left\lceil \left(n+n_2-\left\lceil\sqrt{n+n_2+0.25}-1.5\right\rceil\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right\rceil.$$ Hence, the conjecture holds for all trees of order $n$ with at most $\left\lfloor \sqrt{n-1}\right\rfloor$ degree-2 vertices.</description>

      <title>The ratio monotonicity of Eulerian-type polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by determining the location of modes of some unimodal Eulerian-type polynomials. The notion of ratio monotonicity was introduced by Chen-Xia when they investigated the $q$-derangement numbers. Let $(f_n(x))_{n\geqslant 0}$ be a sequence of real polynomials satisfying the Eulerian-type recurrence relation $$f_{n+1}(x)=(anx+bx+c)f_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f_n(x),~f_0(x)=1,$$ where $a,b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers. Assume that $deg f_n(x)=n$. Setting $g_n(x)=x^nf_n\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, we have $$g_{n+1}(x)=(anx+b+cx)g_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}g_n(x),$$ We find that if $a+c\geqslant b\geqslant c&gt;0$, then $f_n(x)$ is bi-gamma-positive and $g_n(x)$ is ratio monotone. As applications, we discover the ratio monotonicity of several Eulerian-type polynomials, including the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials, a kind of generalized Eulerian polynomials studied by Carlitz-Scoville, the $(des_B,neg)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials over the hyperoctahedral group and the $r$-colored Eulerian polynomials. In particular, let $A_n(x,q)$ be the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, we find that the polynomials $x^{n-1}A_n(1/x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $0&lt;q\leqslant 1$, while $A_n(x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $1\leqslant q\leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Reflexive polytopes and the Picard ranks of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the sum of the Picard ranks of a polar pair of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties of dimension $d\geq 3$ is at most the minimum of the number of facets and vertices of the corresponding pair of reflexive polytopes minus $(d-1)$. This is a generalization of Eikelberg's theory of affine dependences describing the Picard groups of toric varieties. The upper bound is achieved if and only if the polar pair is a simple-simplicial pair.</description>

      <title>Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</description>
