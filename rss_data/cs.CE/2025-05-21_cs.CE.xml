      <title>Deployment of Traditional and Hybrid Machine Learning for Critical Heat Flux Prediction in the CTF Thermal Hydraulics Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling, where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Local-Global Associative Frames for Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structures are defined by the periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D space, inherently making them equivariant to SO(3) group. A fundamental requirement for crystal property prediction is that the model's output should remain invariant to arbitrary rotational transformations of the input structure. One promising strategy to achieve this invariance is to align the given crystal structure into a canonical orientation with appropriately computed rotations, or called frames. However, existing work either only considers a global frame or solely relies on more advanced local frames based on atoms' local structure. A global frame is too coarse to capture the local structure heterogeneity of the crystal, while local frames may inadvertently disrupt crystal symmetry, limiting their expressivity. In this work, we revisit the frame design problem for crystalline materials and propose a novel approach to construct expressive Symmetry-Preserving Frames, dubbed as SPFrame, for modeling crystal structures. Specifically, this local-global associative frame constructs invariant local frames rather than equivariant ones, thereby preserving the symmetry of the crystal. In parallel, it integrates global structural information to construct an equivariant global frame to enforce SO(3) invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPFrame consistently outperforms traditional frame construction techniques and existing crystal property prediction baselines across multiple benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Open Earth Science as Fast and Accessible as Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is natural-language-driven earth observation data analysis now feasible with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs)? For open science in service of public interest, feasibility requires reliably high accuracy, interactive latencies, low (sustainable) costs, open LLMs, and openly maintainable software -- hence, the challenge. What are the techniques and programming system requirements necessary for satisfying these constraints, and what is the corresponding development and maintenance burden in practice? This study lays the groundwork for exploring these questions, introducing an impactful earth science use-case, and providing a software framework with evaluation data and metrics, along with initial results from employing model scaling, prompt-optimization, and inference-time scaling optimization techniques. While we attain high accuracy (near 100%) across 10 of 11 metrics, the analysis further considers cost (token-spend), latency, and maintainability across this space of techniques. Finally, we enumerate opportunities for further research, general programming and evaluation framework development, and ongoing work for a comprehensive, deployable solution. This is a call for collaboration and contribution.</description>

      <title>R&amp;D-Agent-Quant: A Multi-Agent Framework for Data-Centric Factors and Model Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.</description>

      <title>Degree-Optimized Cumulative Polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Probability Distributions via Divide-and-Conquer: Convergence and Error Propagation under Distributional Arithmetic Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies a general divide-and-conquer algorithm for approximating continuous one-dimensional probability distributions with finite mean. The article presents a numerical study that compares pre-existing approximation schemes with a special focus on the stability of the discrete approximations when they undergo arithmetic operations. The main results are a simple upper bound of the approximation error in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance that is valid for all continuous distributions with finite mean. In many use-cases, the studied method achieve optimal rate of convergence, and numerical experiments show that the algorithm is more stable than pre-existing approximation schemes in the context of arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Elasto-acoustic wave propagation in geophysical media using hybrid high-order methods on general meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid high-order (HHO) methods are numerical methods characterized by several interesting properties such as local conservativity, geometric flexibility and high-order accuracy. Here, HHO schemes are studied for the space semi-discretization of coupled elasto-acoustic waves in the time domain using a first-order formulation. Explicit and singly diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta (ERK &amp; SDIRK) schemes are used for the time discretization. We show that an efficient implementation of explicit (resp. implicit) time schemes calls for a static condensation of the face (resp. cell) unknowns. Crucially, both static condensation procedures only involve block-diagonal matrices. Then, we provide numerical estimates for the CFL stability limit of ERK schemes and present a comparative study on the efficiency of explicit versus implicit schemes. Our findings indicate that implicit time schemes remain competitive in many situations. Finally, simulations in a 2D realistic geophysical configuration are performed, illustrating the geometrical flexibility of the HHO method: both hybrid (triangular and quadrangular) and nonconforming (with hanging nodes) meshes are easily handled, delivering results of comparable accuracy to a reference spectral element software based on tensorized elements.</description>

      <title>Online Prediction-Assisted Safe Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Recommendation in Dynamically Coupled Transportation-Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), the transportation network and power grid become increasingly interdependent and coupled via charging stations. The concomitant growth in charging demand has posed challenges for both networks, highlighting the importance of charging coordination. Existing literature largely overlooks the interactions between power grid security and traffic efficiency. In view of this, we study the en-route charging station (CS) recommendation problem for EVs in dynamically coupled transportation-power systems. The system-level objective is to maximize the overall traffic efficiency while ensuring the safety of the power grid. This problem is for the first time formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an online prediction-assisted safe reinforcement learning (OP-SRL) method is proposed to learn the optimal and secure policy by extending the PPO method. To be specific, we mainly address two challenges. First, the constrained optimization problem is converted into an equivalent unconstrained optimization problem by applying the Lagrangian method. Second, to account for the uncertain long-time delay between performing CS recommendation and commencing charging, we put forward an online sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) predictor for state augmentation to guide the agent in making forward-thinking decisions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network and a large-scale real-world road network, coupled with IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution systems, respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines in terms of road network efficiency, power grid safety, and EV user satisfaction. The case study on the real-world network also illustrates the applicability in the practical context.</description>

      <title>EvoMesh: Adaptive Physical Simulation with Hierarchical Graph Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have been a powerful tool for mesh-based physical simulation. To efficiently model large-scale systems, existing methods mainly employ hierarchical graph structures to capture multi-scale node relations. However, these graph hierarchies are typically manually designed and fixed, limiting their ability to adapt to the evolving dynamics of complex physical systems. We propose EvoMesh, a fully differentiable framework that jointly learns graph hierarchies and physical dynamics, adaptively guided by physical inputs. EvoMesh introduces anisotropic message passing, which enables direction-specific aggregation of dynamic features between nodes within each hierarchy, while simultaneously learning node selection probabilities for the next hierarchical level based on physical context. This design creates more flexible message shortcuts and enhances the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on five benchmark physical simulation datasets show that EvoMesh outperforms recent fixed-hierarchy message passing networks by large margins.

      <title>Diffusion-based Method for Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification is crucial for space safety and satellite monitoring, involving the analysis of typical satellite behaviors such as station-keeping, drift, etc. However, existing PoL identification methods remain underdeveloped due to the complexity of aerospace systems, variability in satellite behaviors, and fluctuating observation sampling rates. In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</description>
