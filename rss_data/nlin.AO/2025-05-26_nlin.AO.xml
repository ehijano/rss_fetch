      <title>Synchronization of identical oscillators on a sphere: exact results with external forces and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model on the sphere under higher-order interactions and an external periodic force. For identical oscillators, we introduce a novel way to incorporate three- and four-body interactions into the dynamics of the order parameter, allowing for a full dimensional reduction of this system. We discuss how such reduction can be implemented in two different ways and how they are related. When restricted to the equator, the dynamics is similar to that of the usual Kuramoto model, up to an interesting renormalization of the coupling constants. Outside this plane, the motion reduces to a two-parameter set of periodic orbits. We also locate the bifurcation curves of the system as functions of different parameters.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like description of Oscillatory Behavior in Chemotactic Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of chemotaxis in the movement dynamics of Aphaenogaster Senilis ants. To do so, we design an experimental setup in which individual ants are exposed to a narrow pheromone trail to guide their motion. As expected, ants locate and navigate the trail by detecting chemical scents, exhibiting a characteristic zigzag pattern, moving at a nearly constant speed while oscillating perpendicularly to the trail. The zigzagging motion is common across many species yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose a physical framework based on the Inertial Spin Model as an approach to quantitatively describe and explain this behavior. So, we implement chemotaxis resembling magnetic-like interactions between the ant's velocity and the pheromone gradient. Under specific approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations perpendicular to the trail, predicting a characteristic oscillatory decay. This prediction closely matches our experimental data, suggesting that the model captures the essential ingredients of ant dynamics. By fitting the model parameters to individual experimental trajectories, we further explore their potential biological significance and validate our assumptions. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of chemotaxis in ant motion and its physical features.</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Despite being a fundamental issue in convective organization, the self-aggregation of clouds lacks a theoretical explanation due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce an idealized mathematical model where the system's state is represented solely by the vertically integrated water vapor content of atmospheric columns under the weak temperature gradient approximation. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidate the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns induces bistability, leading to dry and moist equilibria. This reflects the circulation effects driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state realizes when destabilization by nonlocal coupling, triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state, overcomes stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems where all columns are equally coupled, perturbations with the maximum wavelength exhibit the highest growth rate. This results in a solution with an infinitely long wavelength, understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. Conversely, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbations with wavelengths close to the characteristic length of the coupling are preferred. The results reveal that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation. Moreover, this study suggests a physical similarity between convective self-aggregation and moisture mode.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.</description>
