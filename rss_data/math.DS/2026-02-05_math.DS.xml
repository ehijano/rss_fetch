      <title>On the existence of global cross sections to volume-preserving flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new criterion for the existence of a global cross
  section to a non-singular volume-preserving flow $\Phi$ on a closed
  smooth manifold $M$. Namely, if $X$ is the infinitesimal generator
  of the flow and $\Phi$ preserves a smooth volume form $\Omega$, then
  $\Phi$ admits a global cross section if there exists a smooth
  Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ with Riemannian volume $\Omega$ and
  $g(X,X) = 1$ such that $\lVert \delta_g (i_X \Omega) \rVert_g &lt; 1$, where
  $\delta_g$ denotes the codifferential relative to $g$;
  (equivalently, $\lVert dX^\flat \rVert_g &lt; 1$). In that case, there in fact
  exists another smooth Riemannian metric on $M$ with respect to which
  the canonical form $i_X \Omega$ is co-closed and therefore harmonic.</description>

      <title>Stable covers of subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system, a characteristic measure is a Borel probability measure invariant under all of its automorphisms. Frisch and Tamuz asked if every symbolic system supports such a measure. Motivated by this problem, we study the natural cover of a subshift by its shift of finite type approximations and two senses in which this cover can be said to stabilize. The first is in terms of entropy decay and the second in terms of periodic points. We show that the first type of stabilization gives a new characterization of the class of language stable shifts and demonstrates that there is a mechanism for producing a characteristic measures that relies only on entropy differences. For the second type of stabilization, we show that this defines a new class of subshifts, invariant under conjugacies, that have characteristic measures.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems and Quantitative Statistical Stability for the Equilibrium States of Piecewise Partially Hyperbolic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes limit theorems and quantitative statistical stability for a class of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps that are neither necessarily continuous nor locally invertible. By employing a flexible functional-analytic framework that bypasses the classical requirement of compact embeddings between Banach spaces, we obtain explicit rates of convergence for the variation of equilibrium states under perturbations. Furthermore, we prove the exponential decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem for H\"older observables. A key feature of our approach is its applicability to systems where traditional spectral gap techniques fail due to the presence of singularities and the lack of invertibility. We provide several examples illustrating the scope of our results, including partially hyperbolic attractors over horseshoes, non-invertible dynamics semi-conjugated to Manneville--Pomeau maps, and fat solenoidal attractors.</description>

      <title>The Teichm\"uller Space of a 3-Dimensional Anosov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $3$-dimensional transitive Anosov flow, we realize its Teichm\"uller space of smooth orbit-equivalence classes as a product of two Jacobian function spaces. This proves Cawley's theorem [8] for 3-dimensional transitive Anosov flows. As an application, we show the path-connectedness of orbit-equivalence class of $3$-dimensional transitive Anosov flows, which gives a positive answer of Potrie [40, Question 1] in dimension 3. Moreover, we show the stable Jacobian rigidity of time-preserving conjugacy for $3$-dimensional transitive Anosov flows admitting $C^1$-smooth strong unstable foliations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in analyzing the preservation of bifurcations in a class of piecewise smooth vector fields with a nonregular switching set under a smoothing process that approximates them by smooth vector fields. We examine cases in which the codimension is either preserved or altered, as well as whether the generic nature of the bifurcation is maintained.</description>

      <title>On Data-Driven Unbiased Predictors using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator and its data-driven approximations, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), are widely used for analysing, modelling, and controlling nonlinear dynamical systems. However, when the true Koopman eigenfunctions cannot be identified from finite data, multi-step predictions may suffer from structural inaccuracies and systematic bias. To address this issue, we analyse the first and second moments of the multi-step prediction residual. By decomposing the residual into contributions from the one-step approximation error and the propagation of accumulated inaccuracies, we derive a closed-form expression characterising these effects. This analysis enables the development of a novel and computationally efficient algorithm that enforces unbiasedness and reduces variance in the resulting predictor. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations, showing improved uncertainty properties compared to standard EDMD. These results lay the foundation for uncertainty-aware and unbiased Koopman-based prediction frameworks that can be extended to controlled and stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous eigenvalues of minimal subshifts via S-adic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide characterizations of continuous eigenvalues for minimal symbolic dynamical systems described by $S$-adic structures satisfying natural mild conditions, such as recognizability and primitiveness. Under the additional assumptions of finite alphabet rank or decisiveness of the directive sequence, these characterizations are expressed in terms of associated sequences of local coboundaries. We emphasize the role of combinatorics in the study of continuous eigenvalues through the interplay between coboundaries and extension graphs, and we give several types of sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of trivial letter-coboundaries. As further results, we apply coboundaries in the context of bounded discrepancy, and in particular we obtain a simple characterization of letter-balance for primitive substitutive subshifts. Moreover, we recover a result of Tijdeman on the minimal factor complexity of transitive subshifts with rationally independent letter frequencies. Finally, we use linear-algebraic duality to refine known descriptions of the possible values of eigenvalues in terms of measures of bases.</description>

      <title>Generic one-parameter families of 3-dimensional Filippov Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses openness, density and structural stability conditions of one-parameter families of 3D piecewise smooth vector fields (PSVFs) defined around typical singularities. Our treatment is local and the switching set, $M$, is a $2D$ surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In short, we analyze the robustness and normal forms of certain codimension one singularities that occur in PSVFs. The main machinery used in this paper involves the theory of contact between a vector field and $M$, Bifurcation Theory and the Topology of Manifolds. Our main result states robust mathematical statements resembling the classical Kupka-Smale Theorem in the sense that we establish the openness and density of a large class of PSVFs presenting generic and quasi-generic singularities. Due to the lack of uniqueness of certain solutions associated with PSVFs, we employ Filippov's theory as the basis of our approach throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>A categorical framework for cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a generalized framework for cellular automata using the language of category theory, extending the classical definition beyond set-theoretic constraints. For an arbitrary category $\mathscr{C}$ with products, we define $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata as morphisms $\tau : A^G \to B^G$ in $\mathscr{C}$, where the alphabets $A$ and $B$ are objects in $\mathscr{C}$ and the universe is a group $G$. We show that $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata form a subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ closed under finite products, and that they satisfy a categorical version of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem. For two arbitrary group universes $G$ and $H$, we extend our theory to define generalized $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata as morphisms $\tau : A^G \to B^H$ constructed via a group homomorphism $\phi : H \to G$. Finally, we prove that generalized $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata form a subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ with a finite weak product involving the free product of the underlying group universes. This framework unifies existing concepts and provides purely categorical proofs of foundational results in the theory of cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Turning mechanistic models into forecasters by using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>From Sparse Sensors to Continuous Fields: STRIDE for Spatiotemporal Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.</description>

      <title>How seed banks evolve in plants: a stochastic dynamical system subject to a strong drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how changes in population size and fluctuating environmental conditions influence the establishment of seed banks in plants. Our model is a modification of the Wright-Fisher model with seed bank, introduced by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux. We distinguish between wild type individuals, producing only nondormant seeds, and mutants, producing seeds with dormancy. To understand how changing population size shapes the establishment of seed banks, we analyse the process under a diffusive scaling. The results support the biological insight that seed banks are favoured in a declining population, and disfavoured if population size is constant or increasing. The surprise is that this is true even when population sizes are changing very slowly -- over evolutionary timescales. We also investigate the influence of short-term fluctuations, such as annual variations in rainfall or temperature. Mathematically, our analysis reduces to a stochastic dynamical system forced onto a manifold by a large drift, which converges under scaling to a diffusion on the manifold. Inspired by the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting diffusion coefficients by projecting the system onto its linear counterpart. This provides a general framework for deriving diffusion approximations in models with strong drift and nonlinear constraints.</description>

Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>

      <title>Newton's method applied to rational functions: Fixed points and Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a rational function $R$, let $N_R(z)=z-\frac{R(z)}{R'(z)}.$ Any such $N_R$ is referred to as a Newton map. We determine all the rational functions $R$ for which $N_R$ has exactly two attracting fixed points, one of which is an exceptional point. Further, if all the repelling fixed points of any such Newton map are with multiplier $2$, or the multiplier of the non-exceptional attracting fixed point is at most $\frac{4}{5}$, then its Julia set is shown to be connected. If a polynomial $p$ has exactly two roots, is unicritical but not a monomial, or $p(z)=z(z^n+a)$ for some $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $n \geq 1$, then we have proved that the Julia set of $N_{\frac{1}{p}}$ is totally disconnected. For the McMullen map $f_{\lambda}(z)=z^m - \frac{\lambda}{z^n}$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$ and $m,n \geq 1$, we have proved that the Julia set of $N_{f_\lambda}$ is connected and is invariant under rotations about the origin of order $m+n$. All the connected Julia sets mentioned above are found to be locally connected.</description>

Abstract: We study non-Birkhoff periodic orbits in symmetric convex planar billiards. Our main result provides a quantitative criterion for the existence of such orbits with prescribed minimal period, rotation number, and spatiotemporal symmetry. We exploit this criterion to find sufficient conditions for a symmetric billiard to possess infinitely many non-Birkhoff periodic orbits. It follows that arbitrarily small analytical perturbations of the circular billiard have non-Birkhoff periodic orbits of any rational rotation number and with arbitrarily long periods. We also generalize a known result for elliptical billiards to other $\mathbb{D}_2$-symmetric billiards. Lastly, we provide Matlab codes which can be used to numerically compute and visualize the non-Birkhoff periodic orbits whose existence we prove analytically.</description>

      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>

      <title>Brjuno-Like Functions for nonlinear expanding maps: Fractional Derivatives and Regularity Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cohomological equations appear frequently in dynamical systems. One of the most classical examples is the Liv\v{s}ic equation $$ v(x) = \alpha \circ F(x) - \alpha(x).$$ The existence and regularity of its solutions $\alpha$ is well understood when $F$ is a hyperbolic dynamical system (for instance an expanding map of the circle) and $v$ is a H\"older function.
  The $\textbf{twisted cohomological equation}$ $$ v(x) = \alpha \circ F(x) - (DF(x))^\beta \, \alpha(x) $$ is much less well understood. Functions similar to the famous Brjuno, Weierstrass, and Takagi functions appear as solutions of this equation. This functional equation also appears in the work of M. Lyubich, and of Avila, Lyubich, and de Melo in their study of deformations of quadratic-like and real-analytic maps.
  Nevertheless, there are some striking results concerning the (lack of) regularity of solutions $\alpha$ when $F$ is a linear endomorphism of the circle and $v$ is very regular. Notable contributions include works by Berry and Lewis; Ledrappier; Przytycki and Urba\'nski, and more recently by Bara\'nski, B\'ar\'any and Romanowska, as well as by Shen, and by Ren and Shen, on Takagi and Weierstrass (and Weierstrass-like) functions.
  We study the regularity of solutions $\alpha$ when $F$ is a $\textbf{nonlinear}$ expanding map of the circle and $v$ is not differentiable or even continuous, a setting in which previously used transversality techniques do not appear to be applicable. The new approach uses fractional derivatives to reduce the study of the twisted cohomological equation to that of a corresponding Liv\v{s}ic cohomological equation, and to show that the resulting distributional solutions (in the sense of Schwartz) satisfy certain Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Biomass transfer on autocatalytic reaction network: a delay differential equation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a biological system to grow and expand, mass must be transferred from the environment to the system and be assimilated into its reaction network. Here, I characterize the biomass transfer process for growing autocatalytic systems. By track biomass along reaction pathways, an n-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the reaction network can be reformulated into a one-dimensional delay differential equation (DDE) for its long-term dynamics. The kernel function of the DDE summarizes the overall amplification and transfer delay of the system and serves as a signature for autocatalysis dynamics. The DDE formulation allows reaction networks of various topologies and complexities to be compared and provides rigorous estimation scheme for growth rate upon dimensional reduction of reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>
