      <title>Vorticity-dependent and symmetry-preserving LES models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Lie symmetry-preserving turbulence models for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, within the Large Eddy Simulation framework. These models depend on both the filtered strain-rate tensor and the filtered vorticity tensor. Particular emphasis is placed on models that additionally ensure stability.</description>

      <title>Unitary equivalence in Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fundamental issue of unitary equivalence within the framework of Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theories in the one-dimensional case. Given a deformed Heisenberg algebra, its representation in terms of the Hilbert space and quantum conjugate operators is not uniquely determined. This raises the question of whether two different realizations of the same algebra are equivalent and thus whether they describe the same physics. Having agreed on the formal definition of a quantum GUP theory, we establish the conditions that must be satisfied to discuss unitary equivalence. We use this framework to rigorously prove that two of the main representations used in the literature are actually unitarily equivalent, and we specify the conditions that must be met for this equivalence to hold. We explicitly demonstrate unitary equivalence by providing the unitary map and then discuss two relevant physical examples, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the quantum particle in free fall, showing, for each of them, how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results. Finally, we discuss the relationship between these standard GUP representations and the polymer-like representation, inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and related to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We show that, whenever a GUP theory leads to the emergence of a minimal length, these formulations are not unitarily equivalent and therefore describe different quantum physics. This is particularly relevant, as it may indicate that a generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem, which holds in ordinary Quantum Mechanics, may not be possible in the GUP framework, at least within our definition of unitary equivalence.</description>

      <title>Hyperpfaffian Correlations for Beta-Ensembles: Beta an Even Square Integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a hyperpfaffian formulation for correlation functions in $\beta$-ensembles of $M \times M$ random matrices when $\beta = L^2$ is an even square integer. More specifically, to the $m$th correlation function $R_m : \R^m \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ we associate the $L$-vector valued function $\omega_m : \R^m \rightarrow \Lambda^L \R^{L(M-m)}$ such that $R_m(\mathbf y)$ is given by the Vandermonde determinant in $y_1, \ldots, y_M$ times the hyperpfaffian of $\omega_m.$ The partition function of the ensemble was previously shown to be the hyperpfaffian of a {\it Gram} $L$-form $\omega$ in $\Lambda^L \R^{LM},$ and we demonstrate the relationship between $\omega_m(\mathbf y)$ and $\omega$, both having coefficients built from integrals of Wronskians of monic polynomials. Assuming the existence of families of polynomials sympathetic with the weight of the ensemble, we may construct $\omega(\mathbf y)$ so it is very sparse (relative to the expected ${L(M-m) \choose L}$ coefficients of a general $L$-vector). These generalize skew-orthogonal polynomials arising in the well-understood $\beta = 4$ situation. Finally we explore the situation in the circular $\beta = L^2$ ensembles. Here the monomials give a prototype, and we give explicit formulas for (the circular versions of) $\omega$ and $\omega_m.$ We use our hyperpfaffian framework to produce exact formulas for the two point function when $\beta = 16$ for small values $M.$ Along the way we will record hyperpfaffian evaluations using known values of partition functions of $\beta$-ensembles.</description>

      <title>Quantization of bounded symplectic domains associated with compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic quantization scheme for bounded symplectic domains of the form $D \times G \subset T^\ast G$, where $D \subset \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ is a bounded region defined by algebraic inequalities and $G$ is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The finiteness of the symplectic volume implies that quantization yields a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with observables represented by Hermitian matrices, for which we provide an explicit realization. Boundary effects necessitate modifications of the standard von Neumann and Dirac conditions, which usually underlie the correspondence principle. Physically, the compact group $G$ plays the role of momentum space, while $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ corresponds to the (noncommutative) position space of a particle. The assumption of compact momentum space has profound physical consequences, including the supertunneling phenomenon and the emergence of a maximal fermion density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we define the concept of a \( q \)-cosymplectic manifold, on which we study the Hamiltonian, gradient, local gradient, and \( q \)-evolution vector fields. Several Liouville--Arnold-type theorems and a \( q \)-cosymplectic Marsden--Weinstein reduction theorem are established. We also provide physical examples illustrating the application of the structure to multitime dynamics (Fast-slow dynamical system). To make our work more self-contained, we include detailed proofs for some results that may resemble those known for cosymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks: From Theory to Simulation of Interconnected Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new framework integrating port-Hamiltonian systems (PHS) and neural network architectures. This framework bridges the gap between deterministic and stochastic modeling of complex dynamical systems. We introduce new mathematical formulations and computational methods that expand the geometric structure of PHS to account for uncertainty, environmental noise, and random perturbations. Building on these advances, we introduce stochastic port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs), which facilitate the accurate learning and prediction of non-autonomous and interconnected stochastic systems. Our proposed framework generalizes passivity concepts to the stochastic regime, ensuring stability while maintaining the system's energy-consistent structure. Extensive simulations, including those involving damped mass-spring systems, Duffing oscillators, and robotic control tasks, demonstrate the capability of pHNNs to capture complex dynamics with high fidelity, even under noise and uncertainty. This unified approach establishes a foundation for the robust, data-driven modeling and control of nonlinear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall phases in gated rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene (RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics for group field theories II: Methods for nonequilibrium renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our earlier work, which aimed to develop methods for understanding the renormalization group of tensorial group field theories within the stochastic quantization framework. In that first study, we showed that the equations governing melonic structures, together with Ward identities, make it possible to close the hierarchy of flow equations, thereby reproducing the results of equilibrium theory. In the present work, we go further by extending the formalism to the out-of-equilibrium regime, while also examining the stability of dynamical equilibrium, specifically, potential violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our objective here is purely methodological, and we focus on a simplified ``toy'' Abelian model that retains only the characteristic non-localities of group field theories.</description>

      <title>Crystallization in the Winterbottom shape and sharp fluctuation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address finite crystallization in two dimensions in the presence of a flat crystalline substrate. Particles interact through short-range two- and three-body potentials favoring local square-lattice arrangements. An additional interaction term of relative strength $\beta&gt;0$ couples the particles and the substrate. Our first main result proves crystallization for all $\beta&gt;0$, corresponding to
  the onset of discrete Winterbottom configurations. The proof relies on a stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond graph of minimizing configurations.
  Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\beta\in (0,1)$. We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\beta$ is rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws. As a corollary, we derive a discrete-to-continuum convergence of minimizers towards the Winterbottom equilibrium shape in the large-particle limit.</description>

Abstract: We establish noncommutative Kn\"{o}rrer periodicity for projective-module factorizations over an arbitrary ring, using the equivariantization theory with respect to various actions by a cyclic group of order two. We obtain an explicit quasi-inverse of the periodicity. We compare the periodicity with a certain tensor functor between big singularity categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a series of results concerning the uniqueness of Kerr-de Sitter as a family of smooth stationary black hole solutions to the nonlinear Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The results only assume smoothness rather than analyticity of the solution in question. The results use a two-sided approach to rigidity, requiring assumptions on both the event horizon and the cosmological horizon (or a neighborhood thereof) to formulate an appropriate unique continuation argument to prove the rigidity of Kerr-de Sitter.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05793v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum spatial best-arm identification via quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ground state energies (GSE) of multipartite $p$-spin models. Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other.</description>

      <title>Equality of ADM mass and generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.</description>

Abstract: We study anisotropic fractional discrete Laplacians $\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}$ with exponents $\vec{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. We establish a Mourre estimate on compact energy intervals away from thresholds. As consequences we derive a Limiting Absorption Principle in weighted spaces, propagation estimates (minimal velocity and local decay), and the existence and completeness of local wave operators for perturbations $H=\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}+W(Q)$, where $W$ is an anisotropically decaying potential of long--range type. In the stationary scattering framework we construct the on--shell scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$, prove the optical theorem, and, under a standard trace--class assumption on $W$, establish the Birman--Krein formula $\det S(\lambda)=\exp(-2\pi i\,\xi(\lambda))$.</description>

Abstract: A.P. Balachandran was a theoretical physicist of extraordinary versatility and originality. In a career spanning over six decades, he made many significant contributions to quantum field theory and mathematical physics. His influence extends beyond the impact of his papers, with a large number of research students and collaborators. Here, in an attempt at a coherent scientific biography, I try to contextualize and evaluate his many contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study variants of Hikita conjecture for Nakajima quiver varieties and corresponding Coulomb branches. First, we derive the equivariant version of the conjecture from the non-equivariant one for a set of gauge theories. Second, we suggest a variant of the conjecture, with K-theoretic Coulomb branches involved. We show that this version follows from the usual (homological) one for a set of theories. We apply this result to prove the conjecture in finite ADE types. In the course of the proof, we show that appropriate completions of K-theoretic and homological (quantized) Coulomb branches are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Limiting distribution of the chemical distance in high dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the asymptotic distribution of the chemical distance in high-dimensional critical Bernoulli percolation. Namely, we show that the distance between the origin and a distant vertex conditioned to lie in the cluster of the origin converges in distribution when rescaled by a multiple the square of the Euclidean distance. The limiting distribution has an explicit density and coincides with the distribution of the time for a Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ conditioned to hit a given unit vector to reach its target. Our result follows from a general moment computation for quantities that have an additive structure across the pivotal edges on a long-range connection in percolation. In addition to the number of pivotal edges in a long connection, this also includes the effective resistance. The existence of the incipient infinite cluster limit, in a form recently established, plays a key role in the derivation of our results.</description>

      <title>On the inverse transmission eigenvalue problem with a piecewise $W_2^1$ refractive index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse spectral problem of determining the spherically symmetric refractive index in a bounded spherical region of radius $b$. Instead of the usual case of the refractive index $\rho\in W^2_2$, by using singular Sturm-Liouville theory, we {first} discuss the case when the refractive index $\rho$ is a piecewise $ W^1_2$ function. We prove that if $\int_0^b \sqrt{\rho(r)} dr&lt;b$, then $\rho$ is uniquely determined by all special transmission eigenvalues; if $\int_0^b \sqrt{\rho(r)} dr=b$, then all special transmission eigenvalues with some additional information can uniquely determine $\rho$. We also consider the mixed spectral problem and obtain that $\rho$ is uniquely determined from partial information of $\rho$ and the ``almost real subspectrum".</description>

Abstract: Off-shell actions for massless higher-spin $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets in five dimensions (5D) are constructed in harmonic superspace in terms of unconstrained prepotentials. Cubic couplings of these supermultiplets to the $q$-hypermultiplet are derived. We also provide a detailed derivation of the unconstrained prepotential for the 5D Weyl supermultiplet which has been used within the conformal superspace approach to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.</description>

      <title>Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</description>

      <title>The High Energy Distribution of Scattering Phase Shifts of Schr\"odinger operators in Hyperbolic Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a trace formula for the high energy limit of the scattering phase shifts of Schr\"odinger operators with short range real valued potentials in hyperbolic space; it relates the scattering shifts and the geodesic X-ray transform of the potential. This extends a result of Bulger and Pushnitski for Schr\"odinger operators in Euclidean space. As an application, we prove that the high energy limit of the phase shifts uniquely determines radial potentials which are monotone and decay super-exponentially. This extends a result of Levinson for potential perturbations of the Euclidean Laplacian to this special class of potentials in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>The slice decomposition of planar hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slice decomposition is a bijective method for enumerating planar maps (graphs embedded in the sphere) with control over face degrees. In this paper, we extend the slice decomposition to the richer setting of hypermaps, naturally interpreted as properly face-bicolored maps, where the degrees of faces of each color can be controlled separately. This setting is closely related with the two-matrix model and the Ising model on random maps, which have been intensively studied in theoretical physics, leading to several enumerative formulas for hypermaps that were still awaiting bijective proofs.
  Generally speaking, the slice decomposition consists in cutting along geodesics. A key feature of hypermaps is that the geodesics along which we cut are directed, following the canonical orientation of edges imposed by the coloring. This orientation requires us to introduce an adapted notion of slices, which admit a recursive decomposition that we describe.
  Using these slices as fundamental building blocks, we obtain new bijective decompositions of several families of hypermaps: disks (pointed or not) with a monochromatic boundary, cylinders with monochromatic boundaries (starting with trumpets or cornets having one geodesic boundary), and disks with a "Dobrushin" boundary condition. In each case, the decomposition ultimately expresses these objects as sequences of slices whose increments correspond to downward-skip free (Lukasiewicz-type) walks subject to natural constraints.
  Our approach yields bijective proofs of several explicit expressions for hypermap generating functions. In particular, we provide a combinatorial explanation of the algebraicity and of the existence of rational parametrizations for these generating functions when face degrees are bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition under which the time marginal of the law of $\mu$-symmetric diffusion process $\mathsf{X}$ in the infinite dimensional configuration space $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is the unique Wasserstein $\mathsf{W}_{2, \mathsf{d}_\mathbf\Upsilon}$ $\mathsf{EVI}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy (a.k.a. Kullback-Leibler divergence) $\mathrm{Ent}_{\mu}$ on the space $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ of probability measures on $\mathbf \Upsilon$. Here, $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is equipped with the $\ell^2$-matching extended distance $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon$ and a Borel probability $\mu$ while $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ is endowed with the transportation extended distance $\mathsf W_{2, \mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon}$ with cost $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon^2$. Our results include the cases $\mu=\mathsf{sine}_2$ and $\mu= \mathsf{Airy}_2$ point processes, where the associated diffusion processes are unlabelled solutions to the infinite-dimensional Dyson-type stochastic differential equations in the bulk and soft-edge limit respectively. As an application, we show that the extended metric measure space $(\mathbf \Upsilon , \mathsf{d}_\mathbf \Upsilon, \mu)$ satisfies the Riemannian curvature-dimension (RCD) condition as well as the distorted Brunn-Minkowski inequality, the HWI inequality and several other functional inequalities. Finally we prove that the time marginal of the law of $\mathsf{X}$ propagates number rigidity and tail triviality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Connes spectral distance of quantum states and analyse the nonlocality of a 4D generalized noncommutative phase space. By virtue of the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we obtain the Dirac operator and construct a spectral triple corresponding to the noncommutative phase space. Based on the ball condition, we obtain some constraint relations about the optimal elements, and then calculate the Connes spectral distance between two Fock states. Due to the noncommutativity, the spectral distances between Fock states in generalized noncommutative phase spaces are shorter than those in normal phase spaces. This shortening of distances implies some type of nonlocality caused by the noncommutativity. These spectral distances in the 4D generalized noncommutative phase space are additive and satisfy the normal Pythagoras theorem. When the noncommutative parameters go to zero, the results return to those in normal quantum phase spaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory satisfies a generalization of the famous spin-statistics theorem. To formulate this extension, we define a `higher spin' action of the stable orthogonal group $O$ on appropriate spacetime manifolds, which extends both the reflection involution and spin flip. On the algebraic side, we define a `higher statistics' action of $O$ on the universal target for invertible field theories, $I\mathbb{Z}$, which extends both complex conjugation and fermion parity $(-1)^F$. We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory intertwines these actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to study mixtures of different physical systems brought together on a discrete interface. Adapting work by M\u{a}ntoiu et al., we use an operator algebraic framework such that the bulk systems at infinity of the mixture are recovered via the spatial asymptotics of the operators on the interface. Fixing an asymptotics and interface algebra, we show how the essential spectrum and topological properties can be inferred from the bulk systems at infinity. By working with Hilbert $C^*$-modules, we can further refine these results with respect to an ambient algebra of observables.</description>

      <title>Relations on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ and the negative $r$-spin Witten conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study various properties of a negative spin version of the Witten $ r $-spin class. By taking the top Chern class of a certain vector bundle on the moduli space of twisted spin curves that parametrises $ r $-th roots of the anticanonical bundle, we construct a non-semisimple cohomological field theory (CohFT) that we call the Theta class $ \Theta^r $. This CohFT does not have a flat unit and its associated Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold is nowhere semisimple. Despite this, we construct a semisimple deformation of the Theta class, and using the Teleman reconstruction theorem, we obtain tautological relations on $ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} $. We further consider the descendant potential of the Theta class and prove that it is the unique solution to a set of $ \mathcal{W} $-algebra constraints, which implies a recursive formula for the descendant integrals. Using this result for $ r = 2 $, we prove Norbury's conjecture which states that the descendant potential of $ \Theta^2 $ coincides with the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau function of the KdV hierarchy. Furthermore, we conjecture that the descendant potential of $ \Theta^r $ is the $ r $-BGW tau function of the $ r $-KdV hierarchy and prove the conjecture for $ r = 3 $.</description>

      <title>Unitarizability of Harish-Chandra bimodules over generalized Weyl and $q$-Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a quantized ($K$-theoretic) BFN Coulomb branch with $G=\mathbb{C}^*$ and any $N$, that is, $\mathcal{A}$ is a generalized Weyl or $q$-Weyl algebra. Let $M$ be an $\mathcal{A}$-$\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ bimodule. Choosing an automorphism $\rho$ of $\mathcal{A}$ we can define the notion of an invariant Hermitian form: $(au,v)=(u,v\rho(a))$ for all $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and $u,v\in M$. We obtain a classification of invariant positive definite forms on $M$ in the case when $M$ is Harish-Chandra in the sense of Losev and quantization parameter is generic.</description>

      <title>Taking limits in topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When does topological recursion applied to a family of spectral curves commute with taking limits? This problem is subtle, especially when the ramification structure of the spectral curve changes at the limit point. We provide sufficient (straightforward-to-use) conditions for checking when the commutation with limits holds, thereby closing a gap in the literature where this compatibility has been used several times without justification. This takes the form of a stronger result of analyticity of the topological recursion along suitable families. To tackle this question, we formalise the notion of global topological recursion and provide sufficient conditions for its equivalence with local topological recursion. The global version facilitates the study of analyticity and limits. For nondegenerate algebraic curves, we reformulate these conditions purely in terms of the structure of its underlying singularities. Finally, we apply this to study deformations of $ (r,s) $-spectral curves, spectral curves for weighted Hurwitz numbers, and provide several other examples and non-examples (where the commutation with limits fails).</description>

      <title>An upper bound on geodesic length in 2D critical first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider i.i.d. first-passage percolation (FPP) on the two-dimensional square lattice, in the critical case where edge-weights take the value zero with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Critical FPP is unique in that the Euclidean lengths of geodesics are superlinear -- rather than linear -- in the distance between their endpoints. This fact was speculated by Kesten in 1986 but not confirmed until 2019 by Damron and Tang, who showed a lower bound on geodesic length that is polynomial with degree strictly greater than $1$. In this paper, we establish the first nontrivial upper bound. Namely, we prove that for a large class of critical edge-weight distributions, the shortest geodesic from the origin to a box of radius $R$ uses at most $R^{2+\epsilon}\pi_3(R)$ edges with high probability, for any $\epsilon&gt; 0$. Here $\pi_3(R)$ is the polychromatic 3-arm probability from classical Bernoulli percolation; upon inserting its conjectural asymptotic, our bound converts to $R^{4/3 + \epsilon}$. In any case, it is known that $\pi_3(R) \lesssim R^{-\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, so our bound gives an exponent strictly less than $2$. In the special case of Bernoulli($\tfrac{1}{2}$) edge-weights, we replace the additional factor of $R^\epsilon$ with a constant and give an expectation bound.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate for the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations exhibiting near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show, assuming a suitable decay of correlations, the length scale at which homogenization occurs is at most $\exp(C \log^2(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation--and thus the strength of the disorder--after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we derive an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach may be viewed as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier Equations for Rarefied Transport: Variational Multiscale Moment Methods for the Boltzmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Learning the Optimal Hydrodynamic Closure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows relative to a given kinetic model by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data for the Shakhov model as well as Monte Carlo Simulations and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in close alignment with the underlying kinetic models, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>On Sufficient and Necessary Criteria of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the generalized Bloch representation, we study the separability and entanglement of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying separability. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius defined via the $l_1$-norm of the Bloch vector is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. YangBaxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in [Sasada and Uozumi, 2024]. Ultradiscretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action that satisfies a certain set of renormalization conditions, we analyze how the action must be adjusted to reproduce a first-order change in these renormalization conditions. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space-time dimensions. Relying on existing results in the theory of perturbative renormalization, we derive explicit renormalized expressions for these theories, each of which involves only a finite number of graphs constructed with full propagators and full $n$-point vertices. The renormalizable case is analyzed as well; the derived expressions are ultraviolet finite as the regulator is removed but cannot be written without a regulator. In this sense, the renormalization is not fully explicit in the renormalizable case. Nevertheless, a perturbative solution of the equations starting from the free theory provides the renormalized Feynman graphs, similar to the BPHZ program. For compatibility with the preservation of the renormalization conditions, a projective renormalization scheme, as opposed to a minimal one, is also introduced. The ideas developed are extended to the study of the renormalization of composite operators and the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

      <title>On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field, the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" nonlocal generators depend on coefficients that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Dirac particles, spin and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider dissipation operators used in Quantum Optics for the description of quantum spontaneous emission in the context of damped driven Jaynes-Cummings equations. The equations describe quantised one-mode Maxwell field coupled to a two-level molecule. Our main result is the symmetry and nonpositivity of basic dissipation operator of Quantum Optics.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key ingredient is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point.</description>
