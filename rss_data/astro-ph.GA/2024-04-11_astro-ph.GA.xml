      <title>JADES Data Release 3 -- NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy for 4,000 galaxies in the GOODS fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third data release of JADES, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, providing both imaging and spectroscopy in the two GOODS fields. Spectroscopy consists of medium-depth and deep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 4,000 targets, covering the spectral range 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m and observed with both the low-dispersion prism (R=30-300) and all three medium-resolution gratings (R=500-1,500). We describe the observations, data reduction, sample selection, and target allocation. We measured 2,375 redshifts (2,053 from multiple emission lines); our targets span the range from z=0.5 up to z=13, including 404 at z&gt;5. The data release includes 2-d and 1-d fully reduced spectra, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. We also provide redshifts and S/N&gt;5 emission-line flux catalogs for the prism and grating spectra, and concise guidelines on how to use these data products. Alongside spectroscopy, we are also publishing fully calibrated NIRCam imaging, which enables studying the JADES sample with the combined power of imaging and spectroscopy. Together, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterize the properties of galaxy populations in the first billion years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of dark matter with the extreme galaxy AGC 114905</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGC 114905 is a dwarf gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy seemingly in tension with the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas morphology, remains somewhat uncertain. We present unmatched ultra-deep optical imaging of AGC 114905 reaching surface brightness limits $\mu_{\rm r,lim} \approx 32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ ($3\sigma$; 10 arcsec $\times$ 10 arcsec) obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. With the new imaging, we characterise the galaxy's morphology, surface brightness, colours, and stellar mass profiles in great detail. The stellar disc has a similar extent as the gas, presents spiral arms-like features, and shows a well-defined edge. Stars and gas share similar morphology, and crucially, we find an inclination of $31\pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the previous determinations. We revisit the rotation curve decomposition of the galaxy, and we explore different mass models in the context of CDM, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), fuzzy dark matter (FDM) or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that the latter does not fit the circular speed of the galaxy, while CDM only does so with dark halo parameters rarely seen in cosmological simulations. Within the uncertainties, SIDM and FDM remain feasible candidates to explain the observed kinematics of AGC 114905.</description>

      <title>Refracted Gravity Solutions from Small to Large Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If visible matter alone is present in the Universe, general relativity (GR) and its Newtonian weak field limit (WFL) cannot explain several pieces of evidence, from the largest to the smallest scales. The most investigated solution is the cosmological model $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM), where GR is valid and two dark components are introduced, dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), to explain the $\sim$70\% and $\sim$25\% of the mass-energy budget of the Universe, respectively. An alternative approach is provided by modified gravity theories, where a departure of the gravity law from $\Lambda$CDM is assumed, and no dark components are included. This work presents refracted gravity (RG), a modified theory of gravity formulated in a classical way where the presence of DM is mimicked by a gravitational permittivity $\epsilon(\rho)$ monotonically increasing with the local mass density $\rho$, which causes the field lines to be refracted in small density environments. Specifically, the flatter the system the stronger the refraction effect and thus, the larger the mass discrepancy if interpreted in Newtonian gravity. RG presented several encouraging results in modelling the dynamics of disk and elliptical galaxies and the temperature profiles of the hot X-ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters and a covariant extension of the theory seems to be promising.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the physical origin of the prominent Lyman-$\alpha$ emission and absorption in GS9422 at $z = 5.943$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-photometric analysis of the galaxy GS9422 from the JADES GTO survey located at $z=5.943$, anomalously showing a simultaneous strong Ly$\alpha$ emission feature and damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA), based on JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam observations. The best-fit modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a young, low-mass (${\rm log}(M_\star/M_{\odot}) = 7.8 \pm 0.01$) galaxy, with a mass-weighted mean age of the stellar population of $(10.9^{+0.07}_{-0.12})\,$Myr. The identified strong nebular emission lines suggest a highly ionized ($O_{32} = 59$), low-metallicity ($12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 7.78\pm 0.10$) star-forming galaxy with a star-formation rate SFR = ($8.2 \pm 2.8$) $\rm M_{\odot}\;yr^{-1}$ over a compact surface area $A_e = 1.85$ kpc$^{2}$, typical for galaxies at this epoch. We carefully model the rest-frame UV NIRSpec Prism spectrum around the Ly$\alpha$ edge, finding that the Ly$\alpha$ emission-line redshift is consistent with the longer-wavelength recombination lines and an escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc,Ly\alpha} = 30\%$ but that the broad DLA feature is not able to converge on the same redshift. Instead, our modelling suggests $z_{\rm abs}= 5.40 \pm 0.10$, the exact redshift of a newly identified proto-cluster in nearby projection to the target galaxy. We argue that most of the HI gas producing the strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing indeed has to be unassociated with the galaxy itself, and thus may indicate that we are probing the cold, dense circumcluster medium of this massive galaxy overdensity. These results provide an alternative solution to the recent claims of continuum nebular emission or an obscured active galactic nucleus dominating the rest-frame UV parts of the spectrum and provide further indications that strong DLAs might preferentially be associated with galaxy overdensities.

      <title>The HI Mass Function of Star-forming Galaxies at $z\approx1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first estimate of the HI mass function (HIMF) of star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$, obtained by combining our measurement of the scaling relation between HI mass ($M_{HI}$) and B-band luminosity ($M_B$) of star-forming galaxies with literature estimates of the B-band luminosity function at $z\approx1$. We determined the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation by using the GMRT-CATz1 survey of the DEEP2 fields to measure the average HI mass of blue galaxies at $z=0.74-1.45$ in three separate $M_B$ subsamples. This was done by separately stacking the HI 21 cm emission signals of the galaxies in each subsample to detect, at (3.5-4.4)$\sigma$ significance, the average HI 21 cm emission of each subsample. We find that the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation at $z\approx1$ is consistent with that at $z\approx0$. We combine our estimate of the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation at $z\approx1$ with the B-band luminosity function at $z\approx1$ to determine the HIMF at $z\approx1$. We find that the number density of galaxies with $M_{HI}&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ (higher than the knee of the local HIMF) at $z\approx1$ is a factor of $\approx4-5$ higher than that at $z\approx0$, for a wide range of assumed scatters in the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation. We rule out the hypothesis that the number density of galaxies with $M_{HI}&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ remains unchanged between $z \approx 1$ and $z\approx0$ at $\gtrsim99.7$\% confidence. This is the first statistically significant evidence for evolution in the HIMF of galaxies from the epoch of cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission Line Profiles of Extreme [OIII] Emitting Galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$: Implications for Ly$\alpha$ Visibility in the Reionization Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have recently begun delivering the first samples of Ly velocity profile measurements at z&gt;6, opening a new window on the reionization process. Interpretation of z&gt;6 line profiles is currently stunted by limitations in our knowledge of the intrinsic Lya profile (before encountering the IGM) of the galaxies that are common at z&gt;6. To overcome this shortcoming, we have obtained resolved (R~3900) Lya spectroscopy of 42 galaxies at z=2.1-3.4 with similar properties as are seen at z&gt;6. We quantify a variety of Lya profile statistics as a function of [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW. Our spectra reveal a new population of z~2-3 galaxies with large [OIII]+H$\beta$ EWs (&gt;1200A) and a large fraction of Lya flux emerging near the systemic redshift (peak velocity ~0km/s). These spectra indicate that low density neutral hydrogen channels are able to form in a subset of low mass galaxies that experience a burst of star formation (sSFR &gt;100/Gyr). Other extreme [OIII] emitters show weaker Lya that is shifted to higher velocities (~240km/s) with little emission near line center. We investigate the impact the IGM is likely to have on these intrinsic line profiles in the reionization era, finding that the centrally peaked Lya emitters should be strongly attenuated at z&gt;5. We show that these line profiles are particularly sensitive to the impact of resonant scattering from infalling IGM and can be strongly attenuated even when the IGM is highly ionized at z~5. We compare these expectations against a database of z&gt;6.5 galaxies with robust velocity profiles measured with JWST/NIRSpec in its grating mode. We find one z=8.28 source with strong Lya (EW=137A) and very small velocity offset (32km/s), likely implying a rare ionized sightline (&gt;0.5pMpc) at z&gt;8. But overall the results confirm the prediction of our simulations, revealing significantly larger peak velocities than are seen in our z~2-3 sample.</description>

      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) VIII: Complex and Stochastic Metallicity Gradients at z &gt; 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase metallicity gradients are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the metallicity gradients ($\nabla Z$) of six Milky Way-like galaxies throughout their evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for most of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive slopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies. FOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust observational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at $z&gt;1$. By tracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs ($\sim 5$--10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic: the FOGGIE galaxies spend $\sim 30-50$\% of their time far away from a smoothed trajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence simulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from observations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes. Because of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore non-parametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at $z &gt; 1$. We investigate how efficiently non-parametric measures of the 2-D metallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results suggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity will be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-$z$ {\it JWST} observations with the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>No evidence for anisotropy in galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary clockwise/anticlockwise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations of AGN-host Dwarf Galaxies Selected with Different Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the stellar populations and star formation histories of 235 active galactic nuclei (AGN)-host dwarf galaxies, consisting of four samples identified separately with different methods (i.e., radio, X-ray, mid-IR and variability), utilizing the synthesis code STARLIGHT and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8. Our results show that the variability sample is the oldest, while the mid-IR sample is the youngest, for which the luminosity at 4020 \AA\ is dominated ($&gt;50\%$) by the young population ($t&lt;10^8$ yr). The light-weighted mean stellar age of the whole sample is in general about 0.7 dex younger than the optical sample studie in Cai et al. We compare the population results between fitting models with and without a power-law (PL) component and find that the neglect of a PL component would lead to an under- and over-estimation by 0.2 and 0.1 dex for the light- and mass-weighted mean stellar age, respectively, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, which has a mean fractional contribution of $\sim$16\% from the AGN. In addition, we obtain further evidence for a possible suppression of star formation in the host galaxy by the central AGN. We also find that there exists an anti-correlation between the extinction-corrected [O\,{\sc iii}] luminosity and light-weighted mean stellar age, confirming our previous finding that there is a physical connection between AGN and star-forming activies in AGN-host dwarfs.</description>

      <title>PROJECT-J: JWST observations of HH46~IRS and its outflow. Overview and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of the JWST program PROJECT-J (PROtostellar JEts Cradle Tested with JWST ), designed to study the Class I source HH46 IRS and its outflow through NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopy (1.66 to 28 micron). The data provide line-images (~ 6.6" in length with NIRSpec, and up to 20" with MIRI) revealing unprecedented details within the jet, the molecular outflow and the cavity. We detect, for the first time, the red-shifted jet within ~ 90 au from the source. Dozens of shock-excited forbidden lines are observed, including highly ionized species such as [Ne III] 15.5 micron, suggesting that the gas is excited by high velocity (&gt; 80 km/s) shocks in a relatively high density medium. Images of H2 lines at different excitations outline a complex molecular flow, where a bright cavity, molecular shells, and a jet-driven bow-shock interact with and are shaped by the ambient conditions. Additional NIRCam 2 micron images resolve the HH46 IRS ~ 110 au binary system and suggest that the large asymmetries observed between the jet and the H2 wide angle emission could be due to two separate outflows being driven by the two sources. The spectra of the unresolved binary show deep ice bands and plenty of gaseous lines in absorption, likely originating in a cold envelope or disk. In conclusion, JWST has unraveled for the first time the origin of the HH46 IRS complex outflow demonstrating its capability to investigate embedded regions around young stars, which remain elusive even at near-IR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The first spectroscopic IR reverberation programme on Mrk 509</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near IR spectroscopic reverberation of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) potentially allows the infrared (IR) broad line region (BLR) to be reverberated alongside the disc and dust continua, while the spectra can also reveal details of dust astro-chemistry. Here, we describe results of a short pilot study (17 near-IR spectra over a 183 d period) for Mrk 509. The spectra give a luminosity-weighted dust radius of $\langle R_{\mathrm{d,lum}} \rangle = 186 \pm 4$ light-days for blackbody (large grain dust), consistent with previous (photometric) reverberation campaigns, whereas carbon and silicate dust give much larger radii. We develop a method of calibrating spectral data in objects where the narrow lines are extended beyond the slit width. We demonstrate this by showing our resultant photometric band light curves are consistent with previous results, with a hot dust lag at &gt;40 d in the K band, clearly different from the accretion disc response at &lt;20 d in the z band. We place this limit of 40 d by demonstrating clearly that the modest variability that we do detect in the H and K band does not reverberate on time-scales of less than 40 d. We also extract the Pa$\beta$ line light curve, and find a lag which is consistent with the optical BLR H$\beta$ line of $\sim$70-90 d. This is important as direct imaging of the near-IR BLR is now possible in a few objects, so we need to understand its relation to the better studied optical BLR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Quasar variability has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the properties of their inner engine and the accretion process onto supermassive black holes. Correlations between UV/optical variability and physical properties have been long studied with a plethora of different approaches and time-domain surveys, although the detailed picture is not yet clear. Aims: We analysed archival data from the SDSS Stripe-82 region to study how the quasar power spectral density (PSD) depends on the black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, redshift, and rest-frame wavelength. We developed a model-independent analysis framework that could be easily applied to upcoming large surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods: We used light curves of 8042 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, observed in at least six yearly seasons in five filters ugriz. We split the sample into bins of similar physical properties containing at least 50 sources, and we measured the ensemble PSD in each of them. Results: We find that a simple power law is a good fit to the power spectra in the frequency range explored. Variability does not depend on redshift at a fixed wavelength. Instead, both PSD amplitude and slope depend on the black hole mass, accretion rate, and rest-frame wavelength. We provide scaling relations to model the observed variability as a function of the physical properties, and discuss the possibility of a universal PSD shape for all quasars, where frequencies scale with the black hole mass, while normalization and slope(s) are fixed (at any given wavelength and accretion rate).</description>

      <title>New Parameters for Star Cluster Dynamics: the role of clusters initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently introduced three new parameters that describe the shape of the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the innermost stars in globular clusters and trace the clusters dynamical evolution. Here we extend our previous investigations to the case of a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters, started from a broad range of initial conditions. All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr, when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic globular clusters. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in early stages of dynamical evolution, from those that already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses, from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy ansatz for the axisymmetric Jeans equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jeans equations do not form a closed system, and to solve them a parametrization relating the velocity moments is often adopted. For axisymmetric models, a phenomenological choice (the "$b$-ansatz") is widely used for the relation between the vertical ($\sigma_z^2$) and radial ($\sigma_R^2$) components of the velocity dispersion tensor, thus breaking their identity present in two-integral systems. However, the way in which the ansatz affects the resulting kinematical fields can be quite complicated, so that the analysis of these fields is usually performed only after numerically computing them. We present here a general procedure to study the properties of the ansatz-dependent fields $\overline{v_{\varphi}^2}$, $\Delta = \overline{v_{\varphi}^2} - \sigma_z^2$ and $\Delta_R = \overline{v_{\varphi}^2} - \sigma_R^2$. Specifically, the effects of the $b$-ansatz can be determined before solving the Jeans equations once the behaviour over the ($R,z$)-plane of three easy-to-build ansatz-independent functions is known. The procedure also constrains the ansatz to exclude unphysical results (as a negative $\overline{v_{\varphi}^2}$). The method is illustrated by discussing the cases of three well-known galaxy models: the Miyamoto &amp; Nagai and Satoh disks, and the Binney logarithmic halo, for which the regions and the constraints on the ansatz values can be determined analytically; a two-component (Miyamoto &amp; Nagai plus logarithmic halo) model is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Like a candle in the wind: The embers of once aflame, now smouldering galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a photometric search method for identifying smouldering galaxies at $5&lt; z &lt; 8$, which are defined to have weak emission lines and thus generally have low specific star formation rates and may even be in a state of (temporary) quiescence. The deep NIRCam imaging (${\sim}29.5$ AB mag, 5$\sigma$) from the JADES second data release is essential for finding these systems, as they are faint, relatively quiescent dwarf galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{8}$-$10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot)$ in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). Moreover, medium-band imaging is key, enabling a clear identification of the lack of emission lines in these galaxies, thus betraying their dormant flame. Owing to the young age of the Universe, combined with the likely bursty star formation in these first dwarf galaxies, conventional colour-selection methods like the UVJ diagram likely miss a large fraction of the quiescent population in the EoR. Indeed, we find that smouldering galaxies constitute a considerable fraction (0.10-0.35) of the EoR dwarf galaxy population ($M_* \sim 10^{8}$-$10^{9}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$). As predicted by simulations, these first dwarf galaxies are fragile, the star formation in their shallow potential wells easily snuffed out by feedback-driven winds triggered by secular or merger-driven starbursts, with the smouldering fraction increasing with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, we provide observational constraints on the smouldering galaxy comoving number density (${\sim}10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}$ dex$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$), which, although hampered by incompleteness, should aid in our understanding of the primordial baryon cycle, as current simulations greatly disagree on whether these systems are rare (${\sim}1\%$) or common (${\sim}50\%$) in the EoR.</description>

      <title>Crossing walls and windows: the curious escape of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons through ionised channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) line profiles are essential probes of gas in and around galaxies. While isotropic models can successfully reproduce a range of Ly$\alpha$ observables, the correspondence between the model and actual physical parameters remains uncertain. We investigate the effect of anisotropies of Ly$\alpha$ escape using a simplified setup: a hole (fractional size $\tilde s$) within a semi-infinite slab with constant column density. Due to the slab's high line-centre optical depth ($\tau_0\gtrsim 10^{5-6}$), most photons should escape through the empty channel. However, our numerical findings indicate that only a fraction $\sim \tilde s$ of photons exit through this channel. To explain this puzzle, we developed an analytical model describing the scattering and transmission behaviour of Ly$\alpha$ photons in an externally illuminated slab. Our findings show that the number of scatterings per reflection follows a L\'evy distribution ($\propto N^{-3/2}$). This means that the mean number of scatterings is orders of magnitude greater than expectations, facilitating a shift in frequency and the subsequent photon escape. Our results imply that Ly$\alpha$ photons are more prone to traverse high-density gas and are surprisingly less biased to the `path of least resistance'. Hence, Ly$\alpha$ can trace an averaged hydrogen distribution rather than only low-column density `channels'.</description>

      <title>Quasars as standard candles VI: spectroscopic validation of the cosmological sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of quasars has been recently assembled to investigate the non-linear relation between their monochromatic luminosities at 2500{\AA}, and 2 keV and to exploit quasars as a new class of standardized candles. The use of this technique for cosmological purposes relies on the non-evolution with redshift of the UV-optical spectral properties of quasars, as well as on the absence of possible contaminants such as dust extinction and host-galaxy contribution. We address these possible issues by analysing the spectral properties of our cosmological quasar sample. We produced composite spectra in different bins of redshift and accretion parameters (black hole mass, bolometric luminosity), to investigate any possible evolution of the spectral properties of the continuum of the composites with these parameters. We found a remarkable similarity amongst the various stacked spectra. The overall shape of the continuum does not show any statistically significant trend with the accretion parameters nor with the redshift. The composite spectrum of our quasar sample is consistent with negligible levels of both intrinsic reddening (with a colour excess E(B-V)&lt; 0.01) and host-galaxy emission (less than 10%) in the optical. We tested whether unaccounted dust extinction could explain the discrepancy between our cosmographic fit of the Hubble-Lemaitre diagram and the concordance {\Lambda}CDM model. The average colour excess required to solve the tension should increase with redshift up to unphysically high values (E(B-V)=0.1 at z&gt;3) that would imply that the intrinsic emission of quasars is much bluer and more luminous than ever reported in observed spectra. The similarity of quasar spectra across the parameter space excludes a significant evolution of the average continuum properties with any of the explored parameters, confirming the reliability of our sample for cosmological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large fraction of massive stars are found in higher order systems where the presence of a tertiary may significantly modify the system's evolution. In particular, it can lead to increased numbers of compact object binaries and accelerate their mergers with important implications for gravitational wave observations. Using Gaia, we constrain the number of Galactic supernovae that produce unbound triples. We do this by searching 8 supernova remnants for stars with consistent Gaia parallaxes and paths intersecting near the center of the supernova remnant at a time consistent with the age of the remnant. We find no candidates for unbound triple systems. Combined with prior work, less than 11.4\% of supernovae leave behind unbound triples at a 90\% confidence limit. The absence of such systems limits their role in the evolution of massive stars and the formation of merging compact objects.</description>

      <title>Late-end reionization with ATON-HE: towards constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new suite of late-end reionization simulations performed with ATON-HE, a revised version of the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON that includes helium. The simulations are able to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ flux distribution of the E-XQR-30 sample of QSO absorption spectra at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$, and show that a large variety of reionization models are consistent with these data. We explore a range of variations in source models and in the early-stage evolution of reionization. Our fiducial reionization history has a midpoint of reionization at $z = 6.5$, but we also explore an `Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 7.5$ and an `Extremely Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 9.5$. Haloes massive enough to host observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters are highly biased. The fraction of such haloes embedded in ionized bubbles that are large enough to allow high Ly$\alpha$ transmission becomes close to unity much before the volume filling factor of ionized regions. For our fiducial reionization history this happens at $z = 8$, probably too late to be consistent with the detection by JWST of abundant Ly$\alpha$ emission out to $z = 11$. A reionization history in our `Early' model or perhaps even our `Extremely Early' model may be required, suggesting a Thomson scattering optical depth in tension with that reported by Planck, but consistent with recent suggestions of a significantly higher value.</description>

      <title>PSF quality metrics in the problem of revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes using MICADO@ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, astronomers perform point spread function (PSF) fitting for most types of observational data. Interpolation of the PSF is often an intermediate step in such algorithms. In the case of the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) at the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), PSF interpolation will play a crucial role in high-precision astrometry for stellar clusters and confirmation of the Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) presence. Significant PSF variations across the field of view invalidate the approach of deconvolution with a mean PSF or on-axis PSF. The ignoring of PSF variations can be especially unsatisfactory in the case of Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) observations, as these sophisticated and expensive systems are designed to achieve high resolution with ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence in the direction of one reference star. In plenty of tasks, you face the question: How can I establish the quality of PSF fitting or interpolation? Our study aims to demonstrate the variety of PSF quality metrics, including the problem of revealing IMBHs in stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength Study on A Gamma-ray Bright AGN 1308+326 Using KVN at 22 and 43 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Confusion Noise with Hyperspectral Imaging from PRIMAger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) concept aims to perform mapping with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes. PRIMA's imaging instrument, PRIMAger, provides unique hyperspectral imaging simultaneously covering 25-235 $\mu$m. We synthesise images representing a deep, 1500 hr deg$^{-2}$ PRIMAger survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise. We demonstrate that we can construct catalogues of galaxies with a high purity ($&gt;95$ per cent) at a source density of 42k deg$^{-2}$ using PRIMAger data alone. Using the XID+ deblending tool we show that we measure fluxes with an accuracy better than 20 per cent to flux levels of 0.16, 0.80, 9.7 and 15 mJy at 47.4, 79.7, 172, 235 $\mu$m respectively. These are a factor of $\sim$2 and $\sim$3 fainter than the classical confusion limits for 72-96 $\mu$m and 126-235 $\mu$m, respectively. At $1.5 \leq z \leq 2$, we detect and accurately measure fluxes in 8-10 of the 10 channels covering 47-235 $\mu$m for sources with $2 \leq$ log(SFR) $\leq 2.5$, a 0.5 dex improvement on what might be expected from the classical confusion limit. Recognising that PRIMager will operate in a context where high quality data will be available at other wavelengths, we investigate the benefits of introducing additional prior information. We show that by introducing even weak prior flux information when employing a higher source density catalogue (more than one source per beam) we can obtain accurate fluxes an order of magnitude below the classical confusion limit for 96-235 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected $f_{\mathrm{GW}}^{-2/3}$ power-law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semi-analytic SMBHB population model, fit to NANOGrav's 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1,000 realizations we study the populations' characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power-law. The first, at $2 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is below our GWB realizations with $p$-value significance $p = 0.05$ to $0.06$ ($\approx 1.8 \sigma - 1.9 \sigma$). The second, at $16 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is above our GWB realizations with $p = 0.04$ to $0.15$ ($\approx 1.4 \sigma - 2.1 \sigma$). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB which could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by three orders of magnitude, from $\sim 10^6$ to $\sim 10^3$, between $2\; \mathrm{nHz}$ and $20 \; \mathrm{nHz}$. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at $26^{+28}_{-19} \; \mathrm{nHz}$, consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the $26$~nHz break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early universe.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the periodic variability patterns of the X-ray emission from the blazar PG 1553+113</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for periodicity in the multi-wavelength high variable emission of blazars is a key feature to understand dynamical processes at work in this class of active galactic nuclei. The blazar PG 1553+113 is an attractive target due to the evidence of periodic oscillations observed at different wavelengths, with a solid proof of a 2.2-year modulation detected in the $\gamma$-ray, UV and optical bands. We aim at investigating the variability pattern of the PG 1553+113 X-ray emission using a more than 10-years long light curve, in order to robustly assess the presence or lack of a periodic behavior whose evidence is only marginal so far. We conducted detailed statistical analyses, studying in particular the variability properties of the X-ray emission of PG 1553+113 by computing the Lomb-Scargle periodograms, which are suited for the analyses of unevenly sampled time series, and adopting epoch folding techniques. We find out a modulation pattern in the X-ray light curve of PG 1553+113 with a period of $\sim$1.4 years, about 35% shorter than the one observed in the $\gamma$-ray domain. Our finding is in agreement with the recent spectro-polarimetric analyses and supports the presence of more dynamical phenomena simultaneously at work in the central engine of this quasar.</description>

      <title>Searching for short-period variables in M31: method and catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing high-cadence and continuous g- and r-band data over three nights acquired from the 3.6-meter Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) aimed to find short-duration microlensing events, we conduct a systematic search for variables, transients, and asteroids across a $\sim1^\circ$ field of view of the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31). We present a catalog of 5859 variable stars, yielding the most extensive compilation of short-period variable sources of M 31. We also detected 19 flares, predominantly associated with foreground M dwarfs in the Milky Way. In addition, we discovered 17 previously unknown asteroid candidates, and we subsequently reported them to the Minor Planet Center. Lastly, we report a microlensing event candidate C-ML-1 and present a preliminary analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. IV. The Abell 35-Type Central Star of Pa 27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07152</link>

Abstract: We present optical spectroscopy of the 12th-mag central star of the planetary nebula (PN) Patchick 27 (Pa 27), obtained during a survey of faint PN nuclei (PNNi) with the Low-Resolution Spectrograph (LRS2) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The optical spectrum of Pa 27 is that of a K0 III red giant with rotationally broadened lines. However, the star is detected in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) with GALEX, showing that a hot binary component is also present. The spectral-energy distribution from the near-UV to the mid-infrared can be fitted with a combination of the K0 III giant and a hot PNN with an effective temperature of about 50,000 K. Photometric observations of Pa 27, both ground-based and from TESS, show a low-amplitude sinusoidal variation with a period of 7.36 days, probably due to starspots on a rotating and magnetically active cool giant. Pa 27 is a new member of the rare class of "Abell 35-type central stars," which are binary PNNi consisting of a spotted late-type star and a hot pre-white dwarf. They are likely the result of a situation where an AGB star ejects its outer layers in a dense wind, part of which is captured by a distant companion, spinning up its rotation by accretion of material and angular momentum. We suggest several useful follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>The torsion of stellar streams and the overall shape of galactic gravity's source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat rotation curves v(r) are naturally explained by elongated (prolate) Dark Matter (DM) distributions, and we have provided competitive fits to the SPARC database. To further probe the geometry of the halo one needs out-of-plane observables. Stellar streams, poetically analogous to airplane contrails, but caused by tidal dispersion of massive substructures such as satellite dwarf galaxies, would lie on a plane should the DM-halo gravitational field be spherically symmetric. We aim at establishing stellar stream torsion, a local observable that measures the deviation from planarity in differential curve geometry. We perform small-scale simulations of tidally distorted star clusters to check that indeed a central force center produces negligible torsion. Turning to observational data, we identify among the known streams those that are at largest distance from the galactic center and likely not affected by the Magellanic clouds, as most promising for the study, and by means of polynomial fits we extract their differential torsion. We find that the torsion of the few known streams that should be sensitive to most of the Milky Way's DM Halo is much larger than expected for a central spherical bulb alone. This is consistent with non-sphericity of the halo. Future studies of stellar stream torsion with larger samples and further out of the galactic plane should be able to extract the ellipticity of the halo to see whether it is just a slight distortion of a spherical shape or rather ressembles a more elongated cigar.</description>

      <title>Impact of primordial black holes on the formation of the first stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers and the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\sim 10 - 100\ \rm M_\odot$) and supermassive regimes ($\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\ \rm M_\odot$). Although only a small fraction ($\lesssim 1\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is required to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in early structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine semi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible impact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into account two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial star formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the first star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of massive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that can explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent observations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with improved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to better understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation and their imprints in high-redshift observations.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Sizes of Odd Radio Circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of radio source, the so-called Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), have been discovered by recent sensitive, large-area radio continuum surveys. The distances of these sources have so far relied on photometric redshifts of optical galaxies found at the centers of or near the ORCs. Here we present Gemini rest-frame optical spectroscopy of six galaxies at the centers of, or potentially associated with, the first five ORC discoveries. We supplement this with Legacy Survey imaging and Prospector fits to their griz+W1/W2 photometry. Of the three ORCs with central galaxies, all lie at distances (z = 0.27-0.55) that confirm the large intrinsic diameters of the radio circles (300-500 kpc). The central galaxies are massive ($M_*\sim10^{11}M_\odot$), red, unobscured ellipticals with old ($\gtrsim$1~Gyr) stellar populations. They have LINER spectral types that are shock- or AGN-powered. All three host low-luminosity, radio-quiet AGN. The similarity of their central galaxies are consistent with a common origin, perhaps as a blastwave from an ancient starburst. The other two ORCs are adjacent and have no prominent central galaxies. However, the z=0.25 disk galaxy that lies between them hosts a Type 2, moderate-luminosity AGN. They may instead be the lobes of a radio jet from this AGN.</description>

      <title>Effects of physical conditions on the stellar initial mass function: The low-metallicity star-forming region Sh 2-209</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work suggested that the variation of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars depends on the physical conditions, notably, the metallicity and gas density. We investigated the properties of two clusters, namely the main cluster (MC) and the subcluster (SC), in the low-metallicity HII region Sh 2-209 (S209) based on recently derived IMFs. We tested three previously published correlations using previous observations: the top-heaviness of the IMF in dependence on metallicity, the half-mass radius, and the most massive star in dependence on the stellar mass of the embedded clusters. For this region, two different galactocentric distances, namely 10.5 kpc and 18 kpc, were considered, where an age-distance-degeneracy was found for the previously determined IMF to be consistent with other formulated metallicity and density dependent IMFs. The determined half-mass radius (0.080 +/- 0.005) pc and the embedded cluster density (0.2 +/- 0.1) 10^6 Msun pc^-3 for the MC with an age of 0.5 Myr in S209 assuming a galactocentric distance of 18 kpc support the assumption that a low-metallicity environment results in a denser cluster, which leads to a top-heavy IMF. Thus, all three tests are consistent with the previously published correlations. The results for S209 are placed in the context with the IMF determination within the metal-poor cluster in the star-forming region NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical scatter on the Epoch of Reionization [H I]$_{\rm 21cm}$ bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the first star-forming galaxies are the main drivers of cosmic reionization. It is usually assumed that there is a one-to-one relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) inside a galaxy and the host halo mass in semi-analytical/numerical modeling of large-scale ionization maps during the epoch of reionization. However, more accurate simulations and observations suggest that the SFR and ionizing luminosity in galaxies may vary considerably even if the host halo mass is the same. This astrophysical scatter can introduce an additional non-Gaussianity in the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ signal, which might not be captured adequately in the power spectrum. In this work, we have studied the impact of the scatter on the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectrum using semi-numerical simulations. We find that the scatter primarily affects small ionized regions, whereas the large ionized bubbles remain largely unaffected. Although, the fractional change in the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectra due to the scatter is found to be more than a factor of $10$ at large scales ($\lesssim 1\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), it is found to be statistically insignificant. However, at small scales ($k\sim2.55$ Mpc$^{-1}$), we have found the impact due to the scatter to be high in magnitude ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \sim 1$) and statistically significant ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \gtrsim 5$) at neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$. We have also found that in the most optimistic scenario, SKA1-Low might be able to detect these signatures of astrophysical scatter, at $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 5\sigma$ detection significance for $\overline{x}_{\rm HI} \sim$ 0.8 and 0.9 respectively, for the equilateral [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Study of 26 Galactic open clusters with extended main-sequence turnoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that some Galactic open clusters (OCs) exhibit extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) in their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). However, the number of Galactic OCs with eMSTO structures detected so far is limited, and the reasons for their formation are still unclear. This work identifies 26 Galactic OCs with undiscovered eMSTOs and investigates the causes of these features. Stellar population types and fundamental parameters of cluster samples are acquired using CMD fitting methods. Among them, the results of 11 OCs are reliable as the observed CMDs are well-reproduced. We propose the crucial role of stellar binarity and confirm the importance of stellar rotation in reproducing eMSTO morphologies. The results also show that the impact of age spread is important, as it can adequately explain the structure of young OCs and fit the observed CMDs of intermediate-age OCs better.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>
