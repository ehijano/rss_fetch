      <title>Testing a Galactic Lensing Hypothesis with the Prompt Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even at modest amplification, the optical depth to gravitational lensing through the Galaxy is $&lt;10^{-5}$. However, the large apparent isotropic-equivalent energy of GRB 221009A coupled with a path through low Galactic latitude suggests that the conditional probability that this particular GRB was lensed is greater than the very low a priori expectation. With the extreme brightness of the prompt emission, this Galactic lensing hypothesis can be constrained by autocorrelation analysis of Fermi photons on 0.1-1000 ms timescales. In relating lensing mass, magnification, and autocorrelation timescale, I show that a lensed-induced autocorrelation signature by stellar lenses falls below the minimal variability timescale (MVT) expected from a black hole central engine. However, lensing by Galactic dark matter MACHOs ($M_l &gt; 10-1000\,M_\odot$) could be confirmed with this approach. Regardless, at a peak $\gamma$-ray photon rate of $&gt;30$ ms$^{-1}$, GRB 221009A represents a prime opportunity to measure the smallest MVTs of GRBs.</description>

      <title>XMM-NuSTAR Observation and Multiwavelength SED Modeling of Blazar 4FGL J1520.8-0348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can power relativistic jets, which are called blazars when pointed close to our line of sight. Depending on the presence or absence of emission lines in their optical spectra, blazars are categorized into flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) objects. According to the 'blazar sequence', as synchrotron peak frequency ($\nu^{sy}_{pk}$) shifts to higher energies, the synchrotron peak luminosity decreases. This means that BL Lacs as luminous as FSRQs, and with synchrotron peak frequencies $\nu^{sy}_{pk}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz, should not exist. Detected as a high-synchrotron peak (HSP; $\nu^{sy}_{pk}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac, 4FGL J1520.8-0348 shows high gamma-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}&gt;10^{46}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$), being at a high redshift of $z=$1.46. Since it is an outlier in the 'blazar sequence', the process of its jet acceleration and power may be different from bona fide BL Lacs. In this work, we constrain its spectral energy distribution (SED) by modeling the multi-wavelength data from infrared to $\gamma$-ray regime. Simultaneous X-ray data was obtained from X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to constrain the synchrotron emission and underlying electron distribution. On undertaking the SED modeling of the source, including the effect of extragalactic background light, we conclude that the source is more likely to be a 'blue FSRQ' or 'masquerading BL Lac' where the BL Lac is actually a FSRQ in disguise.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the time-integrated polarizations of gamma-ray burst prompt phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the former studies, the time evolution information is missed in deducing the time-integrated polarizations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. Here, it is considered and the time-integrated polarizations is investigated through the summation of the time-resolved ones. The statistical properties of the distribution of the time-integrated polarization degree ($\Pi$) can be read from the $q-\Pi$ curve, where $q\equiv\theta_V/\theta_j$. $\theta_V$ and $\theta_j$ are the observational and jet half-opening angles, respectively. Hence, only the $q-\Pi$ curves are studied. In addition to a toroidal magnetic field in the radiation region, an aligned field is also discussed. We found the predicted time-integrated PD is around $(40-50)\%$ for High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) on board POLAR-2 and is roughly $(30-40)\%$ for its Low-energy Polarimetry Detector (LPD). Therefore, $\Pi$ value detected by the HPD will be larger than that of the LPD in statistics and the result of the former estimations will underestimate the value of $\Pi$ in an ordered field. There are mainly two types of the $q-\Pi$ curve profiles, corresponding to two ordered magnetic field configurations.</description>

      <title>Geminga's pulsar halo: an X-ray view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geminga is the first pulsar around which a remarkable TeV gamma-ray halo extending over a few degrees was discovered by MILAGRO, HAWC and later by H.E.S.S., and by Fermi-LAT in the GeV band. More middle-aged pulsars have exhibited gamma-ray halos, and they are now recognized as an emerging class of Galactic gamma-ray sources. The emission appears in the late evolution stage of pulsars, and is most plausibly explained by inverse Compton scattering of CMB and interstellar photons by relativistic electrons and positrons escaping from the pulsar wind nebulae. These observations pose a number of theoretical challenges. Tackling these questions requires constraining the ambient magnetic field properties, which can be achieved through X-ray observations. If the gamma-ray halos originate from a distribution of highly energetic electrons, synchrotron losses in the ambient magnetic fields of the same particles are expected to produce a diffuse X-ray emission with a similar spatial extension. We present the most comprehensive X-ray study of the Geminga pulsar halo to date, utilising archival data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our X-ray analysis covers a broad bandwidth ($0.5\rm{-}79$ keV) and large field of view ($\sim 4^\circ$) for the first time. This is achieved by accurately measuring the background over the entire field of view, and taking into account both focused and stray-light X-ray photons with NuSTAR. We find no significant emission and set robust constraints on the X-ray halo flux. These are translated to stringent constraints on the ambient magnetic field strength and the diffusion coefficient by using a physical model considering particle injection, diffusion and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, which is tuned by fitting multi-wavelength data. Our novel methodology for modelling and searching for synchrotron X-ray halos can be applied to other pulsar halo candidates.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of sub-pulses in a radio pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are known to manifest complex phenomena, such as nulling, sub-pulse drifting, and periodicity. Within the purview of this investigation, we have harnessed the wavelet analysis technique to scrutinize the multifaceted periodicities and sub-pulse drifting characteristics exhibited by PSR J1926-0652, discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our analysis draws upon the rich dataset acquired from the FAST ultra-wide-bandwidth receiver (UWB), meticulously examining pulse attributes encompassing an entire pulse. It is notable that the pulse apex recurrently manifests approximately every 17.11 times the pulsar's period P, individual sub-pulses exhibit a drifting phenomenon, with a phase decrement of approximately $1.04^\circ$ over each P. Intriguingly, the central phase of each sub-pulse track gradually increments over temporal evolution. Furthermore, the relative offset distribution between successive sub-pulse tracks emanating from the trailing and leading components remains comparatively stable, with a central tendency of approximately $\sim$6.87$\pm$2.56 P. Most notably, derived from the outcomes of wavelet analysis, we ascertain a negative correlation of -0.98 between the periods of sub-pulses and their drifting rates, alongside the intrinsic period of sub-pulses identified at 28.14 seconds.</description>

      <title>SDSS~J075217.84+193542.2: X-ray weighing of a secondary BH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of black hole (BHs) masses are necessary to understand the coevolution of these sources and their host galaxies. Sometimes in the center of a galaxy there is not one, but two BHs. The BH duality of the quasar nucleus SDSS~J075217.84+193542.2 (herein SDSS~J0752) was recently proposed based on the observed strict periodicity of optical emission from the source. We tested this assumption using X-ray observations with Swift/XRT (2008--2010). We fitted the SDSS~J075217 spectrum using a Comptonization model and discovered soft X-ray variability in the 0.3--10~keV energy range. We pursued a scenario in which two supermassive BHs at the center of SDSS~J0752 form a pair; and the less massive (secondary) BH periodically crosses/punctures the disk around the more massive (primary) BH. We associate these periodic crossings with tidal disruptions of the disk and, as a consequence, with an increase in X-rays seen as a flare in SDSS~J0752. During such an X-ray flare event (2008--2010), we discovered a change in the source spectral states and the photon index saturation at the $\Gamma\sim3$ level with mass accretion rate $\dot M$. For BH mass scaling we used sources: OJ~287, M101 ULX--1 and HLX--1 ESO~243--49, as a reference ones, and found that M$_{SDSS}=9\times 10^7$ solar masses, assuming $d_{SDSS}= 500$ Mpc. Thus, we obtained a lower limit to a BH mass due the unknown inclination. In addition, we used the virial mass of the secondary BH based on $H_\alpha$-line measurements and we estimated the binary's inclination at SDSS~J0752, $i=80^{\circ}$, using a scaling technique.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Pulses and Lateral Jet Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that gamma-ray burst pulses are produced when highly-relativistic jets sweep across an observer's line-of-sight. We hypothesize that axisymmetric jet profiles, coupled with special relativistic effects, produce the time-reversed properties of gamma-ray burst pulses. Curvature resulting from rapid jet expansion is responsible for much of the observed pulse asymmetry and hard-to-soft evolution. The relative obliqueness with which the jet crosses the line-of-sight explains the known GRB pulse morphological types. We explore two scenarios: one in which a rigid/semi-rigid jet moves laterally, and the other in which a ballistic jet sprays material from a laterally-moving nozzle. The ballistic jet model is favored based upon its consistency with standard emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Detecting superfluid transition in the pulsar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density QCD phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner as the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey: V. PSR J1901+0658 in a double neutron star system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems offer excellent opportunities to test gravity theories. We report the timing results of a pulsar, PSR J1901+0658, discovered in the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey. Based on timing observations by FAST over 5 years, we obtain the phase-coherent timing solutions and derive the precise measurements of its position, spin parameters, orbital parameters, and also the dispersion measure (DM). It has a period of 75.7 ms, a period derivative of 2.169(6)$\times 10^{-19}$ s s$^{-1}$, and the characteristic age of 5.5 Gyr. This pulsar is in an orbit with a period of 14.45 days and an eccentricity of 0.366. One post-Keplerian parameter, periastron advance, has been well measured as being 0.00531(9) deg/yr, from which the total mass of this system is derived to be 2.79(7) $M_{\sun}$. The pulsar has the upper limit of mass of 1.68 $M_{\sun}$, so the lower limit for the companion mass is 1.11 $M_{\sun}$. Because PSR J1901+0658 is a partially recycled pulsar in an eccentric binary orbit with such a large companion mass, it should be in a DNS system according to the evolution history of the binary system.</description>

      <title>An in-depth analysis of the variable cyclotron lines in GX 301$-$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) system GX 301$-$2 is a persistent source with a well-known variable cyclotron line centered at 35 keV. Recently, a second cyclotron line at 50 keV has been reported with a presumably different behavior than the 35 keV line.
  Aims. We investigate the presence of the newly discovered cyclotron line in the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra at higher luminosities than before. We further aim to determine the pulse-phase variability of both lines.
  Methods. We analyze a NuSTAR observation of GX 301$-$2 covering the pre-periastron flare, where the source luminosity reached its peak of ${\sim} 4 \times 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in the 5-50 keV range. We analyze the phase-averaged spectra in the NuSTAR energy range from 3.5-79 keV for both the complete observation and three time segments of it. We further analyze the phase-resolved spectra and the pulse-phase variability of continuum and cyclotron line parameters.
  Results. We confirm that the description of the phase-averaged spectrum requires a second absorption feature at $51.5^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ keV besides the established line at 35 keV. The statistical significance of this feature in the phase-averaged spectrum is $&gt;99.999\%$. We further find that the 50 keV cyclotron line is present in three of eight phase bins.
  Conclusions. Based on the results of our analysis, we confirm that the detected absorption feature is very likely to be a cyclotron line. We discuss a variety of physical scenarios which could explain the proposed anharmonicity, but also outline circumstances under which the lines are harmonically related. We further present the cyclotron line history of GX 301$-$2 and evaluate concordance among each other. We also discuss an alternative spectral model including cyclotron line emission wings.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron line evolution revealed with pulse-to-pulse analysis in the 2020 outburst of 1A 0535+262</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray luminosity (Lx) dependence of the cyclotron absorption line energy (Ecyc) for the X-ray binary pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its 2020 giant outburst based on pulse-to-pulse analysis. By applying this technique to high cadence observations of Insight-HXMT, we reveal the most comprehensive Ecyc-Lx correlation across a broad luminosity range of ~(0.03-1.3)*10^38 erg/s. Apart from the positive and negative correlations between cyclotron line energy and luminosity at Lx~(1-3)*10^37 erg/s and ~(7-13)*10^37 erg/s, which are expected from the typical subcritical and supercritical accretion regimes, respectively, a plateau in the correlation is also detected at ~(3-7)*10^37 erg/s^-1. Moreover, at the lowest luminosity level (Lx&lt;10^37 erg/s), the positive Ecyc-Lx correlation seems to be broken, and the pulse profile also occurs a significant transition. These discoveries provide the first complete view on the correlation between luminosity and the centriod energy of the cyclotron line, and therefore are relevant for understanding how accretion onto magnetized neutron stars depends on luminosity.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum and $\left \langle \ln A \right \rangle$ by LHAASO -- connecting the Galactic to the extragalactic components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently LHAASO Collaboration gives precise measurements of cosmic rays (CR) all particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass $\left \langle \ln A \right \rangle$ from 0.3 PeV to 30 PeV. Combining the CR measurements by AMS-02 and DAMPE in space and that by LHAASO and Auger on the ground we construct a model to recover all these measurements from tens of GeV to tens of EeV. We find the LHAASO measurement is crucial in the model construction by connecting the Galactic component to the extragalactic component. The precise measurements of CR spectra for individual species by AMS-02 and DAMPE together with the newest LHAASO results clearly indicates three Galactic CR components, that is, a soft low energy background, a hard high energy component, and a local source contribution. However, the LHAASO data show that above $\sim 10^{16}$ eV a nonnegligible extragalactic component must be included. Combining the Auger results and the LHAASO results we figure out the extragalactic CRs which need at least two components at lower and higher energies. Thanks to the precise measurements by LHAASO the constraints on the model parameters are quite stringent. The spectra features and mass measurements in all energy range are all well reproduced in the model.</description>

Abstract: Long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission shows a correlation between the intrinsic peak energy, $E_{\mathrm{p,i}}$, of the time-average $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectrum and the isotropic-equivalent peak gamma-ray luminosity, $L_{{\rm p,iso}}$, as well as the total released energy, $E_{\rm iso}$. The same correlation is found within individual bursts, when time-resolved $E_{\rm p,i}$ and $L_{\rm iso}$ are considered. These correlations are characterised by an intrinsic dispersion, whose origin is still unknown. Discovering the origin of the correlation and of its dispersion would shed light on the still poorly understood prompt emission and would propel GRBs to powerful standard candles. We studied the dispersion of both isotropic-equivalent and collimation-corrected time-resolved correlations. We also investigated whether the intrinsic dispersion computed within individual GRBs is different from that obtained including different bursts into a unique sample. We then searched for correlations between key features, like Lorentz factor and jet opening angle, and intrinsic dispersion, when the latter is treated as one of the characterising We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of 20 long Type-II or collapsar-candidate GRBs detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor with known redshift and estimates of jet opening angle and/or Lorentz factor. The collimation-corrected correlation appears to be no less dispersed than the isotropic-equivalent one. Also, individual GRBs are significantly less dispersed than the whole sample. We excluded (at $4.2 \sigma$ confidence level) the difference in samples' sizes as the possible reason, thus confirming that individual GRBs are {\em intrinsically} less dispersed than the whole sample. No correlation was found between intrinsic dispersion and other key properties for the few GRBs with available information.</description>

Abstract: The measurement of the flux of muons produced in cosmic ray air showers is essential for the study of primary cosmic rays. Such measurements are important in extensive air shower detectors to assess the energy spectrum and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray flux, complementary to the information provided by fluorescence detectors. Detailed simulations of the cosmic ray air showers are carried out, using codes such as CORSIKA, to estimate the muon flux at sea level. These simulations are based on the choice of hadronic interaction models, for which improvements have been implemented in the post-LHC era. In this work, a deficit in simulations that use state-of-the-art QCD models with respect to the measurement deep underwater with the KM3NeT neutrino detectors is reported. The KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescopes are sensitive to TeV muons originating mostly from primary cosmic rays with energies around 10 TeV. The predictions of state-of-the-art QCD models show that the deficit with respect to the data is constant in zenith angle; no dependency on the water overburden is observed. The observed deficit at a depth of several kilometres is compatible with the deficit seen in the comparison of the simulations and measurements at sea level.</description>

      <title>Typing supernova remnant G352.7$-$0.1 using XMM-Newton X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G352.7$-$0.1 is a mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnant (SNR) with multiple radio arcs and has a disputed supernova origin. We conducted a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the remnant with XMM-Newton X-ray data to investigate its explosion mechanism and explain its morphology. The global X-ray spectra of the SNR can be adequately reproduced using a metal-rich thermal plasma model with a temperature of $\sim 2$ keV and ionization timescale of $\sim 3\times 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}~s}$. Through a comparison with various supernova nucleosynthesis models, we found that observed metal properties from Mg to Fe can be better described using core-collapse supernova models, while thermonuclear models fail to explain the observed high Mg/Si ratio. The best-fit supernova model suggests a $\sim 13$ $M_\odot$ progenitor star, consistent with previous estimates using the wind bubble size. We also discussed the possible mechanisms that may lead to SNR G352.7$-$0.1 being an MMSNR. By dividing the SNR into several regions, we found that the temperature and abundance do not significantly vary with regions, except for a decreased temperature and abundance in a region interacting with molecular clouds. The brightest X-ray emission of the SNR spatially matches with the inner radio structure, suggesting that the centrally filled X-ray morphology results from a projection effect.</description>

      <title>Abundance stratification in type Ia supernovae -- VII. The peculiar, C-rich iPTF16abc: highlighting diversity among luminous events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) reveal diversity, even within assumed subcategories. Here, the composition of the peculiar iPTF16abc (SN\,2016bln) is derived by modeling a time series of optical spectra. iPTF16abc's early spectra combine traits of SNe 1999aa and 1991T known for weak \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 and prominent \FeIII\ features. However, it differs with weak early \FeIII\ lines, and persistent \CII\ lines post-peak. It also exhibits a weak \CaII\ H\&amp;K feature aligning it with SN\,1991T, an observation supported by their bolometric light curves. The early attenuation of \FeIII\ results from abundance effect. The weakening of the \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 line, stems from silicon depletion in the outer shells, a characteristic shared by both SNe 1999aa and 1991T, indicating a common explosion mechanism that terminates nuclear burning at around 12000 \kms\, unseen in normal events. Beneath a thin layer of intermediate mass elements (IMEs) with a total mass of 0.18 \Msun, extends a \Nifs\ rich shell totaling 0.76 \Msun\ and generating a bolometric luminosity as high as ${L_{\mathrm{peak}}}=1.60 \pm 0.1 \times$ $10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Inner layers, typical of SNe\,Ia, hold neutron-rich elements, (\Feff\ and \Nife), totaling 0.20 M${\odot}$. Stable iron, exceeding solar abundance, and carbon, coexist in the outermost layers, challenging existing explosion models. The presence of carbon down to $v\approx$ 9000\,\kms, totalling $\sim$ 0.01 \Msun\, unprecedented in this class, links iPTF16abc to SN\,2003fg-like events. The retention of 91T-like traits in iPTF16abc underscores its importance in understanding the diversity of SNe\,Ia.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>Accretion disks and relativistic line broadening in boson star spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the observational properties of static, spherically symmetric boson stars with fourth and sixth-order self-interactions, using the Julia-based general-relativistic radiative transfer code Skylight. We assume the boson stars are surrounded by an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. We use the Novikov-Thorne model to compute the energy flux, introducing a physically based accretion model around these boson star configurations. Additionally, we calculate the relativistic broadening of emission lines, incorporating a lamppost corona model with full relativistic effects for the first time around a boson star. Our results show distinct observational features between quartic-potential boson stars and Schwarzschild black holes, owing to the presence of stable circular orbits at all radii around the former. On the other hand, compact solitonic boson stars, which possess an innermost stable circular orbit, have observational features closely similar to black holes. This similarity emphasizes their potential as black-hole mimickers. However, the compact boson stars, lacking an event horizon, have complex light-ring structures that produce potentially observable differences from black holes with future generations of experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark matter effect on black hole accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing different dark matter (DM) models, we explore the DM influence on black hole (BH) accretion disk physics, considering corotating and counterrotating thick accretion tori orbiting a central spinning BH. Our results identify accretion onto a central BH as a good indicator of DM presence, signaling possible DM tracers in accretion physics. We analyze accretion around a spinning BH immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter, cold dark matter and scalar field dark matter. Our investigation addresses observational evidence of distinctive DM effects on toroidal accretion disks and protojet configurations, proving that BH accretion tori immersed in DM can present characteristics, such as interdisk cusp or double tori, which have usually been considered as tracers for superspinars and naked singularity attractors. Therefore, in this context DM influence on the BH geometry could manifest as superspinar mimickers. DM also affects the central spinning attractor energetics associated with accretion physics, and its influence on accretion disks can be searched for in a variation of the central BH energetics as an increase of the mass accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Elastic and breaking properties of epitaxial face-centered crystals in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization of dense matter in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores may be similar to epitaxial crystal growth in terrestrial laboratories. However in stellar crystals, the spacing between horizontal planes has to gradually increase with the outward movement of the crystallization front, tracing decrease of the electron density. This process produces Coulomb crystals with stretched rather than cubic elementary cells. We extend the analysis of the elastic and breaking properties of such crystals to the face-centered (fc) lattice. Shear deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been studied for 22 crystallographic shear planes. A common property for all these planes is a reduction and eventual nulling of the breaking shear strain with deviation from the unstretched configuration. The effective shear moduli for deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been calculated. It is possible that the epitaxial crystallization in compact stars results in a formation of large-scale crystallites or, at least, in growth of the whole crystallization front perpendicular to particular crystallographic planes. For fc structure growth orthogonal to the $\{111\}$ planes, we expect that, at any density, $\sim 5\%$ ($\sim 0.5\%$) of crystallite height is occupied by layers one (two) orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk of the crystallite. This may be important for realistic modeling of crustquakes on neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$-$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Insights from LHAASO and IceCube into the origin of the Galactic diffuse TeV--PeV emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission and neutrino emission are expected from the Galactic plane, generated by hadronuclear interactions between cosmic rays (CR) and interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, measurements of these diffuse emissions will provide important clues on the origin and nature of Galactic CRs. Comparing the latest observations of LHAASO and IceCube on the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino emissions respectively, we suggest that the diffuse gamma-ray emission at multi-TeV energies contains a considerable contribution of a leptonic component. By modelling the gamma-ray halos powered by middle-aged pulsars in our Galaxy with taking into account the magnetic field configuration and the interstellar radiation field in the Galaxy, we demonstrate that the collective contribution of pulsar halos can account for the excess in the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission with respect to the predicted flux from CR-ISM interactions. The resulting one-dimensional profile along the Galactic longitude is also consistent with the observation.</description>

      <title>Evidence of mini-jet emission in a large emission zone from a magnetically-dominated gamma-ray burst jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second brightest GRB in history, GRB230307A provides an ideal laboratory to study the details of GRB prompt emission thanks to its extraordinarily high photon statistics and its single broad pulse overall shape characterized by an energy-dependent fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) profile. Here we demonstrate that its broad pulse is composed of many rapidly variable short pulses, rather than being the superposition of many short pulses on top of a slow component. Such a feature is consistent with the picture of many mini-jets due to local magnetic reconnection events in a large emission zone far from the GRB central engine, as envisaged in the internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence (ICMART) model, but raises a great challenge to the internal shock models that attribute all variability components to collisions among different shells. Since relativistic mini-jets demand strong magnetization in the outflow, this work provides strong evidence for a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition of this bright GRB.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and Dissipative Structures Arising from Relativistic Magnetized Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence have significantly advanced our understanding of turbulent particle acceleration. Recent progress has highlighted the need for an updated acceleration theory that can account for acceleration within the plasma's coherent structures. Here, we investigate how turbulent intermittency models connect statistical fluctuations in turbulence to regions of high dissipation. This connection is established by employing a generalized She-Leveque model to describe the exponents $\zeta_p$ for the structure functions $S^p \propto l^{\zeta_p}$. The fitting of the scaling exponents provide us with a measure of the co-dimension of the dissipative structures, and we subsequently measure their filling fraction. We perform our analysis for a range of magnetizations $\sigma$ and magnetic field fluctuations ${\delta B_0}/{B_0}$. We find that increasing the values of $\sigma$ and ${\delta B_0}/{B_0}$ allows the cascade to break sheets into smaller regions of dissipation that resemble chains of plasmoids. However, as their dissipation increases, the dissipative regions become less volume filling. With this work we aim to inform future turbulent acceleration theories that incorporate particle energization from interactions with coherent structures within relativistic turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recent work has identified a new satellite galaxy, Ursa Major III/UNIONS I, which is the faintest such system ever observed. Dynamical considerations indicate that if the system is in equilibrium, it is likely to be highly dark matter dominated. This, in combination with its proximity, predicts that it may be the preeminent dwarf spheroidal galaxy target for dark matter indirect detection searches. We utilize 15 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for $\gamma$-ray emission from Ursa Major III. Finding no excess, we set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation. Intriguingly, if the high J-factor of Ursa Major III is confirmed, standard thermal dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states would be ruled out for dark matter masses up to 4 TeV. The discovery of Ursa Major III, combined with recent tentative measurements of other high J-factor systems, suggests the exciting possibility that near-future data could produce transformative constraints on thermal dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.</description>

      <title>GammaBayes: a Bayesian pipeline for dark matter detection with CTA</title>

Abstract: We present GammaBayes, a Bayesian Python package for dark matter detection with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). GammaBayes takes as input the CTA measurements of gamma rays and a user-specified dark-matter particle model. It outputs the posterior distribution for parameters of the dark-matter model including the velocity-averaged cross section for dark-matter self interactions $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$. It also outputs the Bayesian evidence, which can be used for model selection. We demonstrate GammaBayes using 525 hours of simulated data, corresponding to $10^8$ observed gamma-ray events. The vast majority of this simulated data consists of noise, but $100000$ events arise from the annihilation of scalar singlet dark matter with $m_\chi= 1$ TeV. We recover the dark matter mass within a 95% credible interval of $m_\chi \sim 0.96-1.07$ TeV. Meanwhile, the velocity averaged cross section is constrained to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 1.4-2.1\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ (95% credibility). This is equivalent to measuring the number of dark-matter annihilation events to be $N_S \sim 1.1_{-0.2}^{+0.2} \times 10^5$. The no-signal hypothesis $\langle \sigma v \rangle=0$ is ruled out with about $5\sigma$ credibility. We discuss how GammaBayes can be extended to include more sophisticated signal and background models and the computational challenges that must be addressed to facilitate these upgrades.

      <title>Dwarf pulses of 10 pulsars detected by FAST</title>

Abstract: How pulsars radiate is a long-standing problem. Detailed polarization measurements of individual pulses shed light on currently unknown emission processes. Recently, based on supersensitive observations, dwarf pulses have been recognized as weak narrow pulses often appearing during the nulling state. In this study, we report the detection of dwarf pulses from ten pulsars, PSRs B0525+21, B1237+25, J1538+2345, J1824$-$0127, J1851$-$0053, B1901+10, J1939+10, B1944+17, B2000+40 and J2112+4058, based on observations conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Dwarf pulses of five pulsars are clearly discernible in the two-dimensional distribution of pulse intensity and pulse width. For the other five pulsars, PSRs J1538+2345, J1824$-$0127, J1939+10, B2000+40, and J2112+4058, only a few dwarf pulses are detected from pulse stacks. The dwarf pulses can emerge in both cone and core emission components for PSR B1237+25, and the polarization angles of these dwarf pulses are mostly in the orthogonal polarization mode of normal pulses for PSR B1944+17. In general, pulsars with detected dwarf pulses tend to be located within the "death valley" region of the distribution of pulsar periods and period derivatives.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum space would be affected by both the nonzero mass $m_{\gamma}$ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to $m_{\gamma}^2\nu^{-4}$, which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to $\nu^{-2}$). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of $9.52\times 10^{-46} \, \rm kg \,\,(5.34 \times 10^{-10}\, \rm eV/c^2$). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wideband spectra are detected by UWB receivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that gravitational wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of rotating black holes in the semiclassical gravity with trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work by Fernandes [arXiv:2305.10382], an exact stationary and axisymmetric solution was discovered in semiclassical gravity with type-A trace anomaly, identified as a quantum-corrected version of the Kerr black hole. In this study, we explore the observational signatures of this black hole solution. Our investigation reveals that there exist prograde and retrograde light rings, whose radii increase monotonically with the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We also observe that when $\alpha$ is negative, the shadow area for the quantum-corrected black hole is smaller than that of the Kerr black hole, whereas when $\alpha$ is positive, the area is larger. Furthermore, for a near-extremal black hole, its high-spin feature (the NHEKline) is found to be highly susceptible to disruption by $\alpha$. Moreover, we discuss the images of the quantum-corrected black hole in the presence of a thin accretion disk and compare them to those of the Kerr black hole. Our study highlights the importance of near-horizon emission sources in detecting the effects of quantum corrections by black hole images.</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae from wide massive binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSG atmospheres are more extended than currently assumed.</description>

      <title>WTP$\,$10aaauow: Discovery of a new FU Ori outburst towards the RCW$\,$49 star-forming region in NEOWISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-amplitude accretion outbursts in young stars are expected to play a central role in proto-stellar assembly. Outburst identification historically has taken place using optical techniques, but over the past decade especially, systematic infrared searches have also become possible with increasing discovery of outburst events located in heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galactic plane. Here, we present the discovery of WTP10aaauow, a large-amplitude mid-infrared (MIR) outburst identified in a systematic search of NEOWISE data using image subtraction techniques designed to recover transients in dense Galactic stellar fields. The new outburst is located towards the RCW 49 star-forming region, and estimated to be at a distance of $\approx4$ kpc via Gaia parallax measurement. Concurrent with the MIR brightening by which it was discovered, we show that the source underwent a $\sim5$ mag outburst in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands as well. WTP10aaauow reached a peak luminosity of $\approx260$ L$_\odot$ in 2014-2015, followed by a slow decline over the next 7 years. Analysis of the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions reveal a pre-outburst stellar photosphere at a temperature of $3600-4000$ K, surrounded by a likely two-component dust structure similar to that of a flat spectrum or Class I type YSO. We present optical and NIR follow-up spectroscopy of the source, that show a GK-type spectrum in the optical bands exhibiting complex line profiles in strong absorption features, and evidence for a wind reaching a terminal velocity of $\approx 400$ km s$^{-1}$. The NIR bands are characterized by a cooler M-type spectrum exhibiting a forest of atomic and molecular features. All together, the spectra demonstrate that WTP10aaauow is an FU Ori type outburst. Ongoing systematic infrared searches will continue to reveal the extent of this population in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole seed scenarios with gravitational wave measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process whereby the supermassive black holes populating the centers of galaxies have been assembled remains to be established, with the relative importance of seeds provided by collapsed Population-III stars, black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via repeated mergers, or direct collapses of protogalactic disks yet to be determined. In this paper we study the prospects for casting light on this issue by future measurements of gravitational waves emitted during the inspirals and mergers of pairs of intermediate-mass black holes, discussing in particular the roles of prospective measurements by LISA and the proposed atom interferometers AION and AEDGE. We find that, the expected number of detectable IMBH binaries is $O(100)$ for LISA and AEDGE and $O(10)$ for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to $O(10)$ for LISA and below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all of these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular if at least a fraction of the SMBHs arise from a low-mass seed population. We also show that the measurement accuracy of the binary parameters is, in general, best for AEDGE that sees very precisely the merger of the binary.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor color superconducting quark stars may not exist</title>

Abstract: Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. And quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out one field-theoretic model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, of investigation on the stability of beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, nevertheless find no physically-allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Waveform Model for Detecting Accelerating Inspiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic frequency-domain gravitational waveform model for an inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.</description>

      <title>Gas Dynamical Friction on Accreting Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker (1999) derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front-back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with the Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way reducing the dynamical friction compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.</description>
