      <title>Verification of the Beer-Lambert Law Using Diluted Tomato Juice and a Halogen Lamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a simple, inexpensive, and engaging laboratory activity designed for undergraduate chemistry education that illustrates the Beer-Lambert law using everyday materials. The choice of tomato juice as the colored analyte, due to its strong visible absorption from lycopene, a carotenoid pigment, makes this activity relevant to real-world applications. To prepare a concentration series, I diluted tomato juice with tap water to yield seven samples (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100%). Transmission spectra for each sample were recorded by passing light from a halogen lamp through a 1 cm cuvette and measuring the transmitted intensity with a spectrometer covering the visible region. The raw spectra revealed clear attenuation in the 480-520 nm region, consistent with the absorption band of lycopene. By converting the data to absorbance and plotting against concentration, I observed a linear relationship in the dilute region, confirming the Beer-Lambert law. At higher concentrations, deviations from linearity were evident, which can be attributed to scattering effects, molecular aggregation, and instrumental limitations. These deviations offer valuable opportunities for classroom discussions about the practical boundaries of the law, thereby preparing students for real-world applications. The activity requires only standard laboratory glassware and a broadband lamp, making it highly accessible. Its combination of visual impact, quantitative analysis, and discussion of limitations enhances student understanding of both the power and the boundaries of spectroscopic methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced by Straight Currents on the Hyperboloid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an introductory exercise of elementary electrodynamics, we consider the static magnetic field induced by the electric currents flow along the straight wires, which are equidistantly put on the hyperboloid. The distribution of the magnetic field and the force acting on the wires are calculated under several typical setups, including the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</description>
