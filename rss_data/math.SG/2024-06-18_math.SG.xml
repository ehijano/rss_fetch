      <title>K-contact manifolds with minimal closed Reeb orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. For the symplectic base manifold of the fibration which admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that the total space of the fibration admits other than the above K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian circle action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance in Networked Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric resonance in oscillator networks subjected to periodically time-varying oscillations in the edge strengths. Such models are inspired by the well-known parametric resonance phenomena for single oscillators, as well as the potential rich phenomenology when such parametric excitations are present in a variety of applications like deep brain stimulation, AC power transmission networks, as well as vehicular flocking formations. We consider cases where a single edge, a subgraph, or the entire network is subjected to forcing, and in each case, we characterize an interesting interplay between the parametric resonance modes and the eigenvalues/vectors of the graph Laplacian. Our analysis is based on a novel treatment of multiple-scale perturbation analysis that we develop for the underlying high-dimensional dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Seshadri constants on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$, and a solution to the symplectic packing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the $r$-point Seshadri constant on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ for those line bundles where the answer might be expected to be governed by $(-1)$-curves. As a consequence we solve the symplectic packing problem for $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Some results on the $r$-point Seshadri constant for other line bundles are given. These latter results use a useful new "reflection method".
  In the analysis there is a striking difference between the cases when $r$ is odd and when $r$ is even. When $r$ is even the problem admits an infinite order automorphism, and there are infinitely many $(-1)$-curves to consider. In contrast, when $r$ is odd only a finite number (usually $4$) types of $(-1)$-curves are relevant to our answer.</description>

      <title>Existence of generating families on Lagrangian cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an embedded exact Lagrangian cobordism between Legendrian submanifolds in the 1-jet bundle, we prove that a generating family linear at infinity on the Legendrian at the negative end extends to a generating family linear at infinity on the Lagrangian cobordism after stabilization if and only if the formal obstructions vanish. In particular, a Lagrangian filling with trivial stable Lagrangian Gauss map admits a generating family linear at infinity.</description>
