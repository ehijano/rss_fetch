      <title>Rethinking Security of Diffusion-based Generative Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image steganography is a technique that conceals secret messages within generated images, without relying on pre-existing cover images. Recently, a number of diffusion model-based generative image steganography (DM-GIS) methods have been introduced, which effectively combat traditional steganalysis techniques. In this paper, we identify the key factors that influence DM-GIS security and revisit the security of existing methods. Specifically, we first provide an overview of the general pipelines of current DM-GIS methods, finding that the noise space of diffusion models serves as the primary embedding domain. Further, we analyze the relationship between DM-GIS security and noise distribution of diffusion models, theoretically demonstrating that any steganographic operation that disrupts the noise distribution compromise DM-GIS security. Building on this insight, we propose a Noise Space-based Diffusion Steganalyzer (NS-DSer)-a simple yet effective steganalysis framework allowing for detecting DM-GIS generated images in the diffusion model noise space. We reevaluate the security of existing DM-GIS methods using NS-DSer across increasingly challenging detection scenarios. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis of DM-GIS security and show the effectiveness of NS-DSer across diverse detection scenarios.</description>

      <title>PRISM-XR: Empowering Privacy-Aware XR Collaboration with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhance collaboration in Extended Reality (XR) environments by enabling flexible object and animation creation through the combination of natural language and visual inputs. However, visual data captured by XR headsets includes real-world backgrounds that may contain irrelevant or sensitive user information, such as credit cards left on the table or facial identities of other users. Uploading those frames to cloud-based MLLMs poses serious privacy risks, particularly when such data is processed without explicit user consent. Additionally, existing colocation and synchronization mechanisms in commercial XR APIs rely on time-consuming, privacy-invasive environment scanning and struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of MLLM-integrated XR environments. In this paper, we propose PRISM-XR, a novel framework that facilitates multi-user collaboration in XR by providing privacy-aware MLLM integration. PRISM-XR employs intelligent frame preprocessing on the edge server to filter sensitive data and remove irrelevant context before communicating with cloud generative AI models. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight registration process and a fully customizable content-sharing mechanism to enable efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving content synchronization among users. Our numerical evaluation results indicate that the proposed platform achieves nearly 90% accuracy in fulfilling user requests and less than 0.27 seconds registration time while maintaining spatial inconsistencies of less than 3.5 cm. Furthermore, we conducted an IRB-approved user study with 28 participants, demonstrating that our system could automatically filter highly sensitive objects in over 90% of scenarios while maintaining strong overall usability.</description>

      <title>VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) significantly enhances emotion recognition performance by integrating complementary emotional cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. While existing methods commonly utilize techniques such as contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to align cross-modal emotional semantics, they typically overlook modality-specific emotional nuances like micro-expressions, tone variations, and sarcastic language. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed OD-PFA multimodal emotion recognition tasks, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>EventCast: Hybrid Demand Forecasting in E-Commerce with LLM-Based Event Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demand forecasting is a cornerstone of e-commerce operations, directly impacting inventory planning and fulfillment scheduling. However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.</description>
