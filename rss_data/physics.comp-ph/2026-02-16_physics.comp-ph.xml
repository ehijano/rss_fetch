      <title>A new model for two-layer liquid-gas stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation via Neural Network-Driven Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes governing material behavior. However, their applicability is fundamentally constrained by the limited time scales accessible to brute-force simulations. This bottleneck often stems from complex energy landscapes where the systems stay trapped in metastable states for long periods of time. Yet, the long-term evolution is controlled by the transitions between the metastable states, which are rare events and difficult to observe. We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems. We propose a rigorous formulation to obtain the original transition rates between metastable states using transition paths obtained from the biased simulation. We further use a branching random walk (BRW) technique to enhance efficiency and to reduce variance. The proposed methodology is validated on 2-dimensional and 14-dimensional systems, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Electrohydrodynamic instability of Cu, W and Ti metal nanomelts under radiofrequency E-fields from multiphysics molecular dynamics simulations with coarse-grained density field analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing both electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics (ED-MD) simulations for atomistic models and the dynamic instability theory of electrocapillary wave, we investigate the structure evolutions and thermal runaway process of Cu, Ti and W nanotips with radii of curvature of 1 nm and 5 nm under various radiofrequency electric field conditions. The associated critical parameters including the critical electric field, spatial and temporal scales of the electrohydrodynamic instability of molten apexes are obtained by proposing the workflows that utilize the atomistic models in ED-MD simulations to calculate kinematic viscosity tensor components and mass density spatial distributions for the nanomelts with electric fields. Our current ED-MD simulations for nanotips show a non-monotonical variation of the time delay versus the electric field frequency for metal nanotips, and the presence of a critical rf electric field amplitude triggering the thermal runaway regardless of the field frequency. The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point. Specifically, the viscosity of nanomelt under the rf electric field is revealed to be several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk liquid metal, resulting in substantial increase of spatial and temporal scales in the instability theory of electrocapillary wave within the viscosity-dominated regime, compared to the results of ED-MD simulations for Cu and Ti metals, while good agreement between the two methods on the critical wavelength and time delay of thermal runway is found for W nanotips.</description>

      <title>A T-matrix scattering formalism for electron-beam spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced computational tools that describe the interaction of electrons with structured nanophotonic materials are crucial for theoretical predictions, specific design tasks, and the interpretation of experimental results. These tools open the door to systematic exploration of free-electron-driven nanophotonic light sources, among others. Here, we report on the implementation of electron-beam spectroscopy in a T-matrix-based scattering formulation. Such a framework is quite versatile in predicting the electromagnetic response of complex photonic materials composed of periodically or aperiodically arranged individual scatterers. By extending this formalism to describe interactions with fast electrons, we provide a fast and accurate numerical tool for simulating cathodoluminescence (CL) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. The desired functionalities are implemented into the existing software suite treams for electromagnetic scattering computations, and the extended code treams_ebeam is available online at https://github.com/tfp-photonics/treams_ebeam. We demonstrate the implementation details on a carefully selected set of problems, including single scatterers of various shapes and materials, a periodic chain of elliptical nanodisks, and a finite cluster of nanospheres arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. By uniting fast-electron physics with advanced scattering theory, our framework unlocks new possibilities for designing, understanding, and engineering next-generation nanoscale light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Full Path Lengths and Kinetics from Partial Path Transition Interface Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Compression for Fully Spectral Vlasov-Poisson Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for kinetic plasma simulation in which the phase-space distribution function is represented by a low-rank tensor network with an adaptive level of compression. The Vlasov-Poisson system is advanced using Strang splitting, and each substep is treated spectrally in the corresponding variable. By expressing both the distribution function and the Fourier transform as tensor network objects (state and operator representations), spectral transforms are applied directly in compressed form, enabling time stepping without reconstructing the full phase-space grid. The self-consistent electric field is also computed within the tensor formalism. The charge density is obtained by contracting over velocity degrees of freedom and extracting the zero Fourier mode, which provides the source term for a spectral Poisson solver. We validate the approach on standard benchmarks, including Landau damping and the two-stream instability. Finally, we systematically study how compression parameters, including truncation tolerances and internal ranks (bond dimensions), affect momentum and energy conservation, positivity behavior, robustness to filamentation, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>An Always-Accepting Algorithm for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Odd Radio Circles Modeled by Shock-Bubble Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States Based on Selected Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced numerical approaches for modeling insoluble surfactants in two-phase flows with the diffuse-interface method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfactants reside at the interface of two-phase flows and significantly influence the flow dynamics. Numerical simulations are essential for a comprehensive understanding of such surfactant-laden flows and require a method that can accurately simulate surfactant transport along the interface. In this study, we focus on interfacial transport models for insoluble surfactants based on the diffuse-interface method and propose two approaches to improve their accuracy: (a) adopting a formulation that avoids the spatial derivatives of variables with sharp gradients and (b) allowing the width of the delta function to be specified independently of the interface width. These approaches are simple and practical in that they do not lead to significant increases in computational cost, implementation complexity, or degradation of interface-capturing accuracy. We conduct a series of numerical tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, we present a challenging test case that is difficult to solve accurately and has not been previously discussed. We expect this case to serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating and comparing the performances of various methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality is ubiquitous in both numerical and data-driven methods. This is particularly severe for space-time methods, which treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously. We investigate the effectiveness of a quantum-inspired approach in alleviating this curse, both for solving PDEs and making data-driven predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm for accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically with both spatial and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate an application where both methods can be combined for cheap and accurate prediction of long-term dynamics. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective, interpretable models that bridge the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>An Oscillation-Free Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative Finite Volume Method for Transcritical and Phase-Change Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative (RFQC) finite volume method is developed to address the numerical simulation of real fluids involving shock waves in transcritical and phase-change flows. To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic quasi-conservative method, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Gr\"uneisen coefficient $\Gamma$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $\Gamma$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error introduced by the RFQC method is a second-order small term dominated by the time-step. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Higher lying excited states beyond S1 and T1 are widely recognized in many photophysical systems, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). However, their explicit and quantitative impact on photophysical observables such as photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and lifetimes is difficult to be attained experimentally and it has not been systematically assessed within a fully ab initio kinetic modeling framework. To address this gap, we developed KinLuv, a multistate excited state kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) and all possible monomolecular interconversion processes between all the electronic states, whose rate constants were computed using Fermi golden rule explicitly including the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling effect. We applied KinLuv to prototypical multi resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitters and their derivatives, as well as other representative organic chromophores, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse photophysical playgrounds beyond TADF. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce key experimental observables, including PLQY and prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes. Beyond its predictive power, the present results establish clear criteria for identifying when higher lying excited states influence the excited state decay and when simplified models remain adequate. This framework enables rational selection of minimal kinetic models that balance physical insight with numerical robustness, with direct implications for the in silico design of high performance organic emitters.</description>

      <title>A Corrected Open Boundary Framework for Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12934</link>

Abstract: The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>
