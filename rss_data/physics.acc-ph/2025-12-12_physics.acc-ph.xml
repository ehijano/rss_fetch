      <title>Searches for electroweak states at future plasma wakefield colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the discovery potential of future multi-TeV plasma wakefield colliders for new electroweak multiplets. We include beam-beam effects through realistic luminosity spectra, comparing five collider configurations: $e^+e^-$ and $e^-e^-$ machines with round- and flat-beams, and a $\gamma\gamma$ collider. The beam-beam effects qualitatively change search strategies relative to idealized mono-energetic lepton colliders, highlighting the importance of the low-energy part of the luminosity spectrum and additional beam-induced initial-state channels. Our results have implications for accelerator R&amp;D priorities, since key electroweak targets may remain accessible even if efficient positron acceleration and flat-beam delivery prove technically challenging at the multi-TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Optimized matching conditions for self-guided laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the matching conditions for self-guided laser pulse propagation in plasma and refine their formulation to maximize the energy of electrons produced via laser wakefield acceleration. Bayesian optimization, combined with particle-in-cell simulations carried out in a quasi-three-dimensional geometry and a Lorentz-boosted frame, is employed. The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning. This provides substantial flexibility for experimental implementation and significantly relaxes the operational constraints associated with self-guided laser wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\text{{\div}}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \text{{\div}} 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Charting the Luminosity Capabilities of the CERN Large Hadron Collider with Various Nuclear Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.</description>

      <title>Generation of Deep Ultraviolet Optical Vortices via Amplitude and Phase Spiral Zone Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>
