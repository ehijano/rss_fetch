      <title>Synthetic data: How could it be used for infectious disease research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three to five years, it has become possible to generate machine learning synthetic data for healthcare-related uses. However, concerns have been raised about potential negative factors associated with the possibilities of artificial dataset generation. These include the potential misuse of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in fields such as cybercrime, the use of deepfakes and fake news to deceive or manipulate, and displacement of human jobs across various market sectors.
  Here, we consider both current and future positive advances and possibilities with synthetic datasets. Synthetic data offers significant benefits, particularly in data privacy, research, in balancing datasets and reducing bias in machine learning models. Generative AI is an artificial intelligence genre capable of creating text, images, video or other data using generative models. The recent explosion of interest in GenAI was heralded by the invention and speedy move to use of large language models (LLM). These computational models are able to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks and are based on transformer architectures, which made an evolutionary leap from previous neural network architectures.
  Fuelled by the advent of improved GenAI techniques and wide scale usage, this is surely the time to consider how synthetic data can be used to advance infectious disease research. In this commentary we aim to create an overview of the current and future position of synthetic data in infectious disease research.</description>

      <title>Automated and Continuous Chronotyping from a Calendar using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Chronotypes -- comparisons of individuals' circadian phase relative to others -- can contextualize mental health risk assessments, and support detection of social jet lag, which can hamper mental health and cognition. Existing ways of determining chronotypes, such as Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) or the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), are limited by being discrete in time and time-intensive to update, rarely capturing real-world variability over time. Chronotyping users based on living schedules, as in daily planner apps, might augment existing methods by assessing chronotype and social jet lag continuously and at scale. Developing this functionality would require a novel tool to translate between digital schedules and chronotypes. Here we use a supervised binary classifier to assess the feasibility of this approach. Methods: In this study, 1,460 registered users from the Owaves app opted in to filled out the MEQ survey. Of those, 142 met the eligibility criteria for data analysis. We used multimodal app data to assess the classification of individuals identified as morning and evening types from MEQ data, basing the classifier on app time series data. This includes daily timing for 8 main lifestyle activity categories (exercise, sleep, social interactions, meal times, relaxation, work, play, and miscellaneous) as defined in the app. Results: The novel chronotyping tool was able to predict the morningness and eveningness of its users with an ROC AUC of 0.70. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of chronotype classification from multimodal, real-world app data. We highlight challenges to applying binary labels to complex, multimodal behaviors. Our findings suggest a potential for real-time monitoring to support future, prospective mental health research.</description>
