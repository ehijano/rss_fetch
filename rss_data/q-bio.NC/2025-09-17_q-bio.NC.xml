      <title>Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.</description>

      <title>Emergent complexity and rhythms in evoked and spontaneous dynamics of human whole-brain models after tuning through analysis tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.</description>

      <title>Overcoming classic challenges for artificial neural networks by providing incentives and practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterize as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.</description>

      <title>When Purple Perceived Only at Fixation: A Fixation and Distance-Dependent Color Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a novel optical illusion is described in which purple structures are perceived as purple at the point of fixation, while the surrounding structures of the same purple color are perceived toward a blue hue. As the viewing distance increases, a greater number of purple structures revert to a purple appearance.</description>
