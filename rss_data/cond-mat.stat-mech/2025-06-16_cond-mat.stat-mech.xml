      <title>Full distribution of the number of distinct sites visited by a random walker in dimension $d \ge 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_M(S)$ of the number of distinct sites $S$ visited by a random walker on a $d$-dimensional lattice after $M$ steps. We focus on the case $d \ge 2$, and we are interested in the long-time limit $M \gg 1$. Our primary interest is the behavior of the right and left tails of $P_M(S)$, corresponding to $S$ larger and smaller than its mean value, respectively. We present theoretical arguments that predict that in the right tail, a standard large-deviation principle (LDP) $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M\Phi\left(S/M\right)}$ is satisfied (at $M \gg 1$) for $d\ge2$, while in the left tail, the scaling behavior is $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M^{1-2/d}\Psi\left(S/M\right)}$, corresponding to a LDP with anomalous scaling, for $d&gt;2$. We also obtain bounds for the scaling functions $\Phi(a)$ and $\Psi(a)$, and obtain analytical results for $\Phi(a)$ in the high-dimensional limit $d \gg 1$, and for $\Psi(a)$ in the limit $a \ll 1$ (describing the far left tail). Our predictions are validated by numerical simulations using importance sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Information thermodynamics of cellular ion pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.</description>

      <title>Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Approach to network failure due to intrinsic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support flux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be triggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or for internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the asymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures. In this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic fluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as extreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be identified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach to network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively similar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks. We obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an all-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real transportation network of flights.</description>

      <title>Transport-Generated Signals Uncover Geometric Features of Evolving Branched Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branched structures that evolve over time critically determine the function of various natural and engineered systems, including growing vasculature, neural arborization, pulmonary networks such as lungs, river basins, power distribution networks, and synthetic flow media. Inferring the underlying geometric properties of such systems and monitoring their structural and morphological evolution is therefore essential. However, this remains a major challenge due to limited access and the transient nature of the internal states. Here, we present a general framework for recovering the geometric features of evolving branched structures by analyzing the signals generated by tracer particles during transport. As tracers traverse the structure, they emit detectable pulses upon reaching a fixed observation point. We show that the statistical properties of this signal intensity -- which reflect underlying first-passage dynamics -- encode key structural features such as network extent, localized trapping frequency, and bias of motion (e.g., due to branch tapering). Crucially, this method enables inference from externally observable quantities, requiring no knowledge of individual particle trajectories or internal measurements. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive strategy for probing dynamic complex geometries across a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches with long range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal Relation between Spectral and Wavefunction Properties at Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility $\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and non-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\chi + D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function $D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.</description>

      <title>Most probable paths for active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations play an important role in the dynamics of stochastic systems. In particular, for small systems, the most probable thermodynamic quantities differ from their averages because of the fluctuations. Using the Onsager Machlup variational formalism we analyze the most probable paths for non-equilibrium systems, in particular active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUP), and investigate how the entropy production along these paths differ from the average entropy production. We investigate how much information about their non-equilibrium nature can be obtained from their extremum paths and how these paths depend on the persistence time and their swim velocities. We also look at how the entropy production along the most probable paths varies with the active noise and how it differs from the average entropy production. This study would be useful to design artificial active systems with certain target trajectories.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in active Rouse polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymers are the archetype of nonequilibrium viscoelastic systems that constantly consume energy to produce motion. The activity of many biopolymers is essential to many life processes. The entropy production rate quantifies their nonequilibrium nature through the breaking of the time reversal symmetry. In this work we build an analytical model of active polymers as active Rouse polymers where the beads are active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particles and calculate their entropy production. The interactions between the beads are decoupled through the normal mode analysis and the entropy production can be solved analytically. We obtain the contribution of each Rouse mode in the entropy production and the dependence of the entropy production on the polymer properties like length. We find that the entropy production is zero for a passive Rouse polymer in the presence of thermal bath as well as for an active Rouse polymer in the absence of thermal bath. For an active chain in the presence of a thermal bath the entropy production is nonzero. In this case we find that the local temporal entropy production dominates the nonlocal entropy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a roughening phase transition that occurs in the entanglement dynamics of certain quantum circuits. Viewing entanglement as the free energy of a membrane in a circuit-defined random environment, there is a competition between membrane smoothing due to lattice pinning and roughening due to disorder in the circuit. In particular, we investigate the randomness-induced roughening transition of the entanglement membrane in a (3+1)-dimensional Clifford circuit model, by calculating the entanglement entropy for various bipartitions. We further construct a scaling theory for membranes tilted away from lattice planes, uncovering new scaling forms and a crossover to a previously unexplored critical "tilted regime".</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Stripe order in quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of magnetic order in geometrically frustrated quasiperiodic systems, focusing on the interplay between local tile symmetry and frustration-induced constraints. In particular, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and general arguments, we map the phase diagram of the model. For small $J_2$, a N\'eel phase appears, whereas a stripe phase is stable for dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$, despite the system's lack of periodicity. Although long-range stripe order emerges below a critical temperature, unlike in random systems, it is softened by the nucleation of competing stripe domains pinned at specific quasiperiodic sites. This behavior reveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices, where geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine the magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to non-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and other broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</description>

      <title>Suppressing excitations in the nonlinear Landau-Zener model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many complex quantum systems can be described by effectively nonlinear dynamics. While such dynamics have many appealing characteristics, they also make the analysis significantly more involved. This is due to the fact that only a few analytical treatments exist, and that the language of quantum mechanics is built for linear operators. For instance, the very formulation of the quantum adiabatic theorem requires the underlying dynamics to be linear. In this work we show that in a generalized Landau-Zener model, nonlinear dynamics can be leveraged to suppress excitations and coherences of the corresponding linear scenario. To this end, we introduce a generalized "energy spectrum", which is defined by the expectation values of the energy under the stationary states. As a main result, we show that the nonlinear term in the evolution equation acts like an effective shortcut to adiabaticity for the linear Landau-Zener problem.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Hilbert subspace imprint: a new mechanism for non-thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for non-ergodic mechanisms in quantum many-body systems has become a frontier area of research in non-equilibrium physics. In this Letter, we introduce Hilbert subspace imprint (HSI)-a novel mechanism that enables evasion of thermalization and bridges the gap between quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). HSI manifests when initial states overlap exclusively with a polynomial scaling (with system size) set of eigenstates. We demonstrate this phenomenon through two distinct approaches: weak symmetry breaking and initial state engineering. In the former case, we observe that ferromagnetic states including those with a single spin-flip display non-thermal behavior under weak U(1) breaking, while antiferromagnetic states thermalize. In contrast, the Z2-symmetric model shows thermalization for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. In the latter case, we engineer the initial state prepared by shallow quantum circuits that enhance the overlap with the small target subspace. Our results establish HSI as a mechanism equally fundamental to non-thermalization as QMBS and HSF.</description>

      <title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A universally applicable approach to connectivity percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Percolation problems appear in a large variety of different contexts ranging from the design of composite materials to vaccination strategies on community networks. The key observable for many applications is the percolation threshold. Unlike the universal critical exponents, the percolation threshold depends explicitly on the specific system properties. As a consequence, theoretical approaches to the percolation threshold are rare and generally tailored to the specific application.
  Yet, any percolating cluster forms a discrete network the emergence of which can be cast as a graph problem and analyzed using branching processes. We propose a general mapping of any kind of percolation problem onto a branching process which provides rigorous lower bounds of the percolation threshold. These bounds progressively tighten as we incorporate more information into the theory. We showcase our approach for different continuum problems finding accurate predictions with almost no effort. Our approach is based on first principles and does not require fitting parameters. As such it offers an important theoretical reference in a field that is dominated by simulation studies and heuristic fit functions.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity in Percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every realistic instance of a percolation problem is faced with some degree of polydispersity, e.g., the pore-size distribution of an inhomogeneous medium, the size distribution of filler particles in composite materials, or the vertex degree of agents in a social network. Studies on different classes of systems have independently found very similar conceptual results for the percolation problem, i.e., that the percolation threshold is insensitive to the particular distribution controlling the polydispersity. Rather, the percolation threshold depends only on the first few moments of the distribution. In this article, we explain this frequently observed pattern using branching processes. The key observation is that a reasonable degree of polydispersity effectively does not alter the structure of the network that forms at the percolation threshold. As a consequence, the critical parameters of the monodisperse system can be analytically continued to account for polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Exact height distribution in one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface with diffusing diffusivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the height distribution of a one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface in the presence of a stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. The height distribution at a fixed point is space is computed analytically. The typical height $h(x,t)$ at a given point in space is found to scale as $t^{3/4}$ and the distribution $G(H)$ of the scaled height $H=h/t^{3/4}$ is symmetric but with a nontrivial shape: while it approaches a nonzero constant quadratically as $H\to 0$, it has a non-Gaussian tail that decays exponentially for large $H$. We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole family of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent $z&gt;1$, with $z=2$ corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that limit cycle systems in Langevin bath exhibit uncertainty in observables that define the limit-cycle plane, and maintain a positive lower bound. The uncertainty-bound depends on the parameters that determine the shape and periodicity of the limit cycle. In one dimension, we use the framework of canonical dissipative systems to construct the limit cycle, whereas in two dimensions, particle in central potentials with radial dissipation provide us natural examples. We also investigate how uncertainties, which are absent in deterministic systems, increase with time when the systems are attached to a bath and eventually cross the lower bound before reaching the steady state.</description>

      <title>Integral equation formulation of run-and-tumble particles in a harmonic trap: the special status of a system in two-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical-mechanical models often exhibit a dimension-dependent solvability: in 1D, exact solutions are straightforward; in 2D, solutions are exact but require nontrivial derivations; and in 3D, closed-form solutions are typically unavailable. This logic is repeated for a simple model of self-propelled particles, run-and-tumble particles (RTP) in a harmonic trap, confirming the claim that the system in 2D enjoys special status. This study revisits the RTP-harmonic-trap model using an integral-equation formulation recently proposed in Ref. \cite{POF-Frydel-2024}. The formulation is based on reinterpreting RTP motion as a jump process. The key quantity of the formulation is a transition operator $G(x,x')$, representing the probability distribution of the jumps of an auxiliary system. The stationary distribution is then obtained from the integral equation $\rho(x) = \int dx' \, \rho(x') G(x,x')$. In 2D, we find that $G(x,x')$ is reversible. This implies the $\rho(x)$ satisfied the detailed balance condition, $\rho(x') G(x,x') = \rho(x) G(x',x)$, from which $\rho(x)$ can be obtained without need of an integral equation. The reversibility of $G(x,x')$ does not mean that RTP particles are in equilibrium. It only means that our specific interpretation of the RTP motion leads to an auxiliary system that is in equilibrium. The reversibility of the system in 2D is lost if the probability distribution of the waiting times (the times that determine the duration on the "run" stage of the RTP motion) deviates from an exponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

Abstract: We present a new approach to quantify urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.</description>
