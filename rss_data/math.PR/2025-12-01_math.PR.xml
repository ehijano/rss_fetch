      <title>Vector liftings for products of probability spaces and measurable modifications of stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of linear primitive liftings $\rho\colon \mathcal{L}^p(\mu)\to \mathcal{L}^p(\mu)$ for probability spaces $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$, which are linear maps selecting a representative from each class for almost everywhere equality. We call them vector liftings. They have the advantage over liftings or linear liftings that they exist for all $p\in[0,\infty]$, not only for $p=\infty$. Their relationship to products is still not clear, but we establish existence of (strong) product vector liftings for products of two factors. The vector liftings which are $2$-marginals with respect to a suitable product yielded a characterization of stochastic processes having a measurable modification modelled on one discovered by Musia{\l}, and led to a proof of the characterization that does not use liftings. The improvement relies on results on extending a measure by null sets that apply when the family of new null sets is an ideal of a $\sigma$-algebra larger than the domain of the measure, but not necessarily an ideal of the power set. These allow us to reduce or eliminate completeness assumptions on the measures from several of our results.</description>

      <title>Landau Hamiltonian with Gaussian white noise potential and the asymptotic of its bottom of spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple construction of a random Schr\"odinger operator subject to a magnetic field with a regularity as low as $0^-$-H\"older and a Gaussian white noise electric potential on a two-dimensional bounded box. This construction is based on the exponential Ansatz introduced in [HL15] and leverages the semigroup approach developed in [HL24].
  The proposed construction enables us to generalise an asymptotic result for the bottom of the spectrum of the two-dimensional continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, first proved in [CvZ21], to the magnetic case. Our choice of potential not only covers the case of a uniform magnetic field, but also those which would break translational invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After proving existence and uniqueness of ergodic distribution dependent backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) under strong and weak dissipativity regimes for the underlying McKean--Vlasov SDE, we leverage this new framework to investigate the long-time behavior of distribution dependent BSDEs on a finite-time horizon. Finally, we apply our results to solve an ergodic McKean--Vlasov stochastic control problem and study the long-time behavior of the value function of a finite-horizon McKean--Vlasov stochastic control problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models of Resource Allocation in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses of a stochastic model of a chemical reaction network with three types of chemical species ${\cal R}$, ${\cal M}$ and ${\cal U}$ that interact to transform a flow of external resources, the chemical species ${\cal Q}$, to produce a product, the chemical species ${\cal P}_r$. A regulation mechanism involving the sequestration of the chemical species ${\cal R}$ when the flow of resources is too low is investigated. The original motivation of the study is of analyzing the qualitative properties of a key regulation mechanism of gene expression in biological cells, the {\em stringent response}.
  A scaling analysis of a Markov process in $\N^5$ representing the state of the chemical reaction network is achieved. It is shown that, depending on the parameters of the model, there are, quite surprisingly, three possible asymptotic regimes. To each of them corresponds a stochastic averaging principle with a fast process expressed in terms of a network of $M/M/\infty$ queues. One of these regimes, the optimal sequestration regime, does not seem to have been identified up to now. Under this regime, the input flow of resources is low but the state of the network is still acceptable in terms of unused macro-molecules, showing the remarkable efficiency of this regulation mechanism. The technical proofs of the main convergence results rely on a combination of coupling arguments, technical estimates of the solutions of SDEs, of sample paths of fast processes in particular, and the stability properties of some dynamical systems in $\R^2$.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Weight Path in a Sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi Graph with Signed Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal{G}(n,\lambda/n)$ where each edge is independently assigned a random signed weight. For two uniformly chosen vertices, we study the joint distribution of the total weights and hopcounts (number of edges) of the near-minimum weight paths connecting them. Under certain conditions on the weight distribution, which ensure in particular that these paths are typically of positive weight, we prove that the point process formed by the rescaled pairs of total weight and hopcount, converges weakly to a Poisson point process with a random intensity. This random intensity is characterized by the product of two independent copies of the Biggins martingale limit of certain branching random walk. This result generalizes the work of Daly, Schulte, and Shneer (arXiv:2308.12149) from non-negative to signed weights.</description>

      <title>A moment approach to the law of large numbers for supercritical branching Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a new proof of the classical law of large numbers for a general class of branching Markov processes based on the asymptotic behaviour of the moments developed in \cite{bmoments, gonzalez2022erratum}. Moreover, we show that the law of the limiting random variable, that is the almost sure limit of the classical additive martingale, is completely determined by its moments.</description>

      <title>How smooth is the drift of the mixed fractional Brownian motion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed fractional Brownian motion, the sum of independent fractional and standard Brownian motions, is known to be a semimartingale if the Hurst exponent $H$ of its fractional component is greater than $3/4$. In this note, we find that the drift in its Doob-Meyer decomposition has derivative which is $\gamma$-H\"older for any $\gamma &lt; 2H-3/2$.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization on time-dependent random conductance models with stable-like jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative homogenization results for time-dependent random conductance models with stable-like long range jumps on $\Z^d$, where the transition probability from $x$ to $y$ is given by $w_{t, x,y}|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\in (0,2)$. In particular, time-dependent random coefficients $\{w_{t,x,y}: t\in \R_+, (x,y)\in E\}$ are uniformly bounded from above (but may be degenerate), and satisfy the Kolmogorov continuous condition, where $E=\{(x, y): x \not= y \in \Z^d\}$ is the set of all unordered pairs on $\Z^d$. The proofs are based on $L^2$-estimates and energy estimates for solutions to regionalparabolic equations and multi-scale Poincar\'e inequalities associated with time-dependent symmetric stable-like random walks with random coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the right tail behavior of a certain class of GMC ratios, reminiscent of H\"older's inequality. We start with a heuristic argument to justify the optimal exponent in the tail estimate. Since Kahane's convexity inequality does not apply to GMC ratios, implementing the heuristic in the continuous setting is nontrivial from the viewpoint of GMC theory. We address the problem by enlarging the class of GMC ratios considered, and deduce the upper and lower bounds for the right tail of GMC ratios.</description>

      <title>Vanishing uniqueness thresholds in Voronoi percolation on products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Poisson--Voronoi percolation and its discrete analogue Bernoulli--Voronoi percolation in spaces with a non-amenable product structure. We develop a new method of proving smallness of the uniqueness threshold $p_u(\lambda)$ at small intensities $\lambda&gt;0$ based on the unbounded borders phenomenon of their underlining ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation. We apply our method to several concrete examples in both the discrete and the continuum setting, including $k$-fold graph products of $d$-regular trees for $k\ge2,d\ge3$ and products of hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb H_{d_1}\times \ldots \times \mathbb H_{d_k}$ for $k\ge2, d_i\ge2$, complementing a recent result of the second and fourth author for symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple real Lie groups with property (T). We also provide new examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs with the FIID sparse unique infinite cluster property, answering positively a recent question of Pete and Rokob.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of self-repelling diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Bena\"im and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.</description>

      <title>On quasi-stationary distributions for stochastic rumor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the quasi-stationary behavior of stochastic rumor processes. Using the results by van Doorn and Pollett (2008), we first prove that the continuous-time Maki--Thompson model has a unique quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) given by the point mass at the state \((0, 1)\). To obtain a non-trivial QSD, we modify the absorption set by conditioning the process on not returning to the level \(y=1\) after leaving the initial state \((N, 1)\). For this modified model, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a non-trivial QSD that assigns positive probability to all transient states, and then derive an explicit formula for this QSD in terms of paths and transition rates. We also discuss the ratio of expectations distribution as an alternative approach to describe the long-term behavior before absorption. The analysis is further extended to the Daley--Kendall rumor model and the stochastic SIR epidemic model.</description>

      <title>Blowup for the multiplicative stochastic heat equation with superlinear drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative white noise: $\partial_t u =\partial_x^2u + b(u) +\sigma(u) \dot W$, both on $[0,1]$ and $\mathbf{R}$. In the case of $[0,1]$ we show that the finite Osgood criterion on $b$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for finite-time blowup, under fairly general conditions on $\sigma$. In the case of $\mathbf{R}$ we show instantaneous explosion when we start with initial profile $u_0\equiv 1$, extending the work of [10] which dealt with bounded $\sigma$. The second result follows from the first by a comparison result which shows that the solution on $\mathbf{R}$ stays above the corresponding solution on $[0,1]$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for hyperbolic SPDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficients driven by space-time L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the global well-posedness of hyperbolic SPDEs on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, driven by a space-time L\'evy white noise, where the drift and diffusion coefficients are assumed to be locally Lipschitz with at most linear growth. The equations are driven by two types of space-time L\'evy noise: (i) a finite-variance L\'evy white noise, and (ii) a symmetric L\'evy basis that may have infinite variance. A typical example of the second class is the symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random measure with $\alpha \in (0,2)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the self-repellent random walk and its local time process on the discrete circle $\mathbb{Z}_n$. While the self-repellent random walk alone is non-Markovian since the jump rates depend on its history via its local time, jointly considering the evolution of the local time profile and the position yields a piecewise deterministic, non-reversible Markov process. We show that this joint process can be interpreted as a second-order lift of a reversible diffusion process, the discrete stochastic heat equation with Gaussian invariant measure. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the relaxation time of order $\Omega(n^{3/2})$. Using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we prove an upper bound for a slightly modified dynamics of order $O(n^2)$, matching recent conjectures in the physics literature. Furthermore, since the self-repellent random walk and its local time process coincide with the Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the harmonic chain, a non-reversible MCMC method, we demonstrate that the relaxation time bound confirms the recent empirical observation that Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms can outperform traditional MCMC methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimality in the Odd-Cycle game: the topological odd-blocker, marked connected components of the giant, consistency of pearls, vanishing homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize optimality of Quantum strategies for the Odd-Cycle game. Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Scientific Software for Quasi-Monte Carlo, Fast Gaussian Process Regression, and Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most scientific domains elicit the development of efficient algorithms and accessible scientific software. This thesis unifies our developments in three broad domains: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for efficient high-dimensional integration, Gaussian process (GP) regression for high-dimensional interpolation with built-in uncertainty quantification, and scientific machine learning (sciML) for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) with mesh-free solvers. For QMC, we built new algorithms for vectorized error estimation and developed QMCPy (https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/): an open-source Python interface to randomized low-discrepancy sequence generators, automatic variable transforms, adaptive error estimation procedures, and diverse use cases. For GPs, we derived new digitally-shift-invariant kernels of higher-order smoothness, developed novel fast multitask GP algorithms, and produced the scalable Python software FastGPs (https://alegresor.github.io/fastgps/). For sciML, we developed a new algorithm capable of machine precision recovery of PDEs with random coefficients. We have also studied a number of applications including GPs for probability of failure estimation, multilevel GPs for the Darcy flow equation, neural surrogates for modeling radiative transfer, and fast GPs for Bayesian multilevel QMC.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$) converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

      <title>A two-parameter, minimal-data model to predict dengue cases: the 2022-2023 outbreak in Florida, USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable and timely dengue predictions provide actionable lead time for targeted vector control and clinical preparedness, reducing preventable diseases and health-system costs in at-risk communities. Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space: From Bandits to MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Zeta Asymptotics on Graphs of Quadratic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Dirichlet Laplacian on large finite metric balls within irregular infinite graphs of quadratic volume growth. We consider an exhaustion $G_n = B_{R_n}(x_0)$ and the spectral zeta value $Z_n(1) = \operatorname{tr}(L_n^{-1})$ of the killed generator $L_n$.
  We establish a sharp asymptotic law under the assumptions that the graph satisfies uniform quadratic volume growth (VG(2)) and a Poincare inequality (PI). These analytic-geometric hypotheses imply large-scale regularity. Additionally, we assume a standard quantitative homogenisation property: a uniform local central limit theorem with a polynomial convergence rate. This hypothesis holds for our main example classes and implies the existence of a global heat-kernel constant $\mathcal{G} &gt; 0$ (independent of $x$). In particular, the lazy simple random walk (LSRW) satisfies $p_t(x,x) \sim \mathcal{G}/t$ as $t \to \infty$.
  Our main theorem establishes the sharp asymptotic $Z_n(1) = \mathcal{G},N_n \log N_n + O(N_n)$, where $N_n := |V(G_n)| \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. This implies a relative error of $O(1/\log N_n)$, with constants depending only on the structural parameters of $G$. This result extends far beyond homogeneous lattices. For $\mathbb{Z}^2$, this yields the constant identification $\mathcal{G} = 2/\pi$, providing a new limit formula that recovers $\pi$ without $\pi$ appearing in the input (a "pi-free" limit). Our techniques highlight the robustness of spectral asymptotics under homogenisation in this critical, recurrent setting.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier joint work, we studied a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on torus with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature, where we proved that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the inverse temperature. However, the analysis in that torus setting relied crucially on compactness and does not directly extend to unbounded domains. This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd.
  In particular, our main result shows that when the energy function is double-well with equal depth, the time complexity scales as seventh power of the inverse temperature, and quadratically in both the inverse allowed absolute error and probability error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the free-probability stochastic control framework introduced in arXiv:2502.17329, we connect optimal control problems for $n \times n$ random matrix ensembles with their infinite-dimensional, free-probability analogues. Under natural convexity hypotheses, we prove that the non-commutative value function captures the large-$n$ limit of the corresponding finite-matrix control problems. As an application, we give a new perspective on the Laplace principle for convex functionals in the theory of large deviations for random matrices.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximations for fast Bayesian inference of partially observed branching processes with applications to epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inference for the states and parameters of a continuous-time multitype branching process from partially observed time series data. Exact inference for this class of models, typically using sequential Monte Carlo, can be computationally challenging when the populations that are being modelled grow exponentially or the time series is long. Instead, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the transition function of the process that leads to a Kalman filtering algorithm that runs in a time independent of the population sizes. We also develop a hybrid approach for when populations are smaller and the approximation is less applicable. We investigate the performance of our approximation and algorithms to both a simple and a complex epidemic model, finding good adherence to the true posterior distributions in both cases with large computational speed-ups in most cases. We also apply our method to a COVID-19 dataset with time dependent parameters where exact methods are intractable due to the population sizes involved.</description>

Abstract: We provide a sufficient characterization for subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ for which partial sums of Steinhaus random multiplicative functions approach a complex standard normal distribution. This extends recent work of Soundararajan and Xu to the function field setting. We apply this characterization to deduce central limit theorems in four cases: polynomials in short intervals, polynomials with few prime factors, shifted primes, and rough polynomials. In doing so, we also establish an explicit Hildebrand inequality for smooth polynomials in short intervals, a function field form of Shiu's theorem for multiplicative functions, and an explicit Chebyshev bound for rough polynomials in short intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of mixed mean-field jump processes on an abstract state space $\Pi$, together with their associated $N$-particle systems. The dynamics consist of the superposition of an independent Markovian component and a bounded mean-field jump interaction; in particular, piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) with mean-field interactions are covered by this framework. Under a second-order bounded difference condition on the mean-field jump kernel, we establish entropic propagation of chaos as $N \to \infty$. In particular, we obtain an explicit qualitative bound on the relative entropy between the law of the $N$-particle system and the product measure induced by the mean-field limit. The proof relies on the second-order concentration inequality introduced in G\"otze and Sambale, 2020.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a probability solution to the nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation on an infinite dimensional space with a centered Gaussian measure $\gamma$ with a unit diffusion operator and a drift of the form $-x+v(p,x)$, where $v$ is a bounded mapping with values in the Cameron-Martin space $H$ of $\gamma$ and $v$ is defined on the space $E\times X$, where is $E$ is the subset of $L^2(\gamma)$ consisting of probability densities. The equation has the form $L_{b(p,\bullet)} ^*(p\cdot \gamma)=0$ with $L_{b(p,\bullet)}\varphi =\Delta_H \varphi + (b(p,\bullet) , D_{_H}\varphi)_{_H}$, so that the drift coefficient depends on the unknown solution, which makes the equation nonlinear. This dependence is assumed to satisfy a suitable continuity condition. This result is applied to drifts of Vlasov type defined by means of the convolution of a vector field with the solution. In addition, we consider a more general situation where only the components of $v$ are uniformly bounded and prove the existence of a probability solution under some stronger continuity condition on the drift.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Koopman Approximation Framework for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) are a general class of continuous-time Markov jump processes used to model a wide range of systems, including biochemical dynamics in single cells, ecological and epidemiological populations, and queueing or communication networks. Yet analyzing their dynamics remains challenging because these processes are high-dimensional and their transient behavior can vary substantially across different initial molecular or population states. Here we introduce a spectral framework for the stochastic Koopman operator that provides a tractable, low-dimensional representation of SRN dynamics over continuous time, together with computable error estimates. By exploiting the compactness of the Koopman operator, we recover dominant spectral modes directly from simulated or experimental data, enabling efficient prediction of moments, event probabilities, and other summary statistics across all initial states. We further derive continuous-time parameter sensitivities and cross-spectral densities, offering new tools for probing noise structure and frequency-domain behavior. We demonstrate the approach on biologically relevant systems, including synthetic intracellular feedback controllers, stochastic oscillators, and inference of initial-state distributions from high-temporal-resolution flow cytometry. Together, these results establish spectral Koopman analysis as a powerful and general framework for studying stochastic dynamical systems across the biological, ecological, and computational sciences.</description>

      <title>Minimizing risk measures with applications in network traffic engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel two-stage optimization framework designed to model integrated quantile functions, which leads to the formulation of a bilinear optimization problem (P). A specific instance of this framework offers a new approach to minimizing the Value-at-risk (Var) and the Conditional Value-at-risk (CVar), thus providing a broader perspective on risk assessment and optimization. We investigate various convexification techniques to under- and over-estimate the optimal value of (P), resulting in new and tighter lower- and upper-convex estimators for the Var minimization problems. Furthermore, we explore the properties and implications of the bilinear optimization problem (P) in connection to the integrated quantile functions. Finally, to illustrate the practical applications of our approach, we present computational comparisons in the context of real-life network traffic engineering problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities and asymptotics of McKean-Vlasov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for solutions to the McKean-Vlasov (granular media) equation on the flat torus in a genuinely nonconvex setting. Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials; this yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without any convexity assumptions and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows; in the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a key application.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture under the additional condition that $a&gt;\lambda/3$, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Convergence and front position for an FKPP-type free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free boundary problem\[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu=\frac{1}{2}\Delta u+u,\quad &amp;t&gt;0, \, x&gt;L_t,\\ u(t,x)=0,\quad &amp;t&gt;0,\, x\le L_t,\\ \int_{L_t}^{\infty}u(t,y)dy=1,\quad &amp;t&gt; 0,\\ u(t,x)dx \to u_0(dx)&amp;\text{weakly as }t\to 0, \end{cases}\] has long been conjectured to be in the universality class of the so-called FKPP reaction-diffusion equation. It appears naturally as the hydrodynamic limit of a branching-selection particle system, the $N$-BBM. In the present work, we show that for any initial condition $u_0(dx)$ that decays fast enough as $x\to\infty$, the solution of the free boundary problem converges to the minimal travelling wave solution. We further show how the decay of the initial condition precisely determines the position of the free boundary $L_t$ at large times $t$, mirroring the celebrated results of Bramson \cite{Bramson1983} in the context of the FKPP equation. Our conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, and for $L_t$ to have the Bramson asymptotics \[ L_t=\sqrt{2}t-\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}\log t+c+o(1)\quad\text{as }t\to\infty,\] are necessary and sufficient. We also apply our results to a more general free boundary problem that depends on a parameter $\beta$, where we see a transition from \emph{pulled} to \emph{pushed} behaviour (with \emph{pushmi-pullyu} behaviour at the critical value of $\beta$). We obtain analogous sharp conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, along with precise asymptotics for the front position, in each of these regimes. To our knowledge, such necessary and sufficient conditions had not previously been established in the pushmi-pullyu or pushed regimes, even for classical monostable reaction-diffusion equations. Our results prove and extend non-rigorous predictions in the physics literature of the first author, Brunet and Derrida.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binomial, the negative binomial, the Poisson, the compound Poisson and the Erlang distribution do all admit integral representations with respect to its (continuous) parameter. We use the Margulis-Russo type formulas for Bernoulli and Poisson processes to derive these representations in a unified way and to provide a probabilistic interpretation for the derivatives. By similar variational methods, we obtain apparently new integro-differential identities which the density of a strictly $\alpha$-stable multivariate density satisfies. Then, we extend Crofton's derivative formula known in integral geometry to the case of a Poisson process. Finally we use this extension to give a new probabilistic proof of a version of this formula for binomial point processes.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of the fractional $\Phi^4$ Euclidean quantum field theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the full subcritical regime via parabolic stochastic quantisation. Our approach is based on the use of a truncated flow equation for the effective description of the model at sufficiently small scales and on coercive estimates for the non-linear stochastic partial differential equation describing the interacting field. The measure is invariant under translations, reflection positive and has quartic exponential tails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generic principal-agent problem in continuous time on a finite time horizon. We introduce a framework in which the agent is allowed to employ measure-valued controls and characterise the continuation utility as a solution to a specific form of a backward stochastic differential equation driven by a martingale measure. We leverage this characterisation to prove that, under appropriate conditions, an optimal solution to the principal's problem exists, even when constraints on the contract are imposed. In doing so, we employ compactification techniques and, as a result, circumvent the typical challenge of showing well-posedness for a degenerate partial differential equation with potential boundary conditions, where regularity problems often arise.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation for two-dimensional Kawasaki dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \theta &lt; 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Theta &lt; \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</description>

      <title>The incipient infinite cluster of the FK-Ising model in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and the susceptibility of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the critical FK-Ising measure $\phi_{\beta_c}$ on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We construct the measure $\phi^\infty:=\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty}\phi_{\beta_c}[\:\cdot\: |\: 0\leftrightarrow x]$ and prove it satisfies $\phi^\infty[0\leftrightarrow \infty]=1$. This corresponds to the natural candidate for the incipient infinite cluster measure of the FK-Ising model. Our proof uses a result of Lupu and Werner (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2016) that relates the FK-Ising model to the random current representation of the Ising model, together with a mixing property of random currents recently established by Aizenman and Duminil-Copin (Ann. Math., 2021). We then study the susceptibility $\chi(\beta)$ of the nearest-neighbour Ising model on $\mathbb Z^d$. When $d&gt;4$, we improve a previous result of Aizenman (Comm. Math. Phys., 1982) to obtain the existence of $A&gt;0$ such that, for $\beta&lt;\beta_c$, \begin{equation*}
  \chi(\beta)= \frac{A}{1-\beta/\beta_c}(1+o(1)), \end{equation*} where $o(1)$ tends to $0$ as $\beta$ tends to $\beta_c$. Additionally, we relate the constant $A$ to the incipient infinite cluster of the double random current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework which can be used to prove that, in an annealed sense, rescaled spatial stochastic population models converge to generalized propagating fronts. Our work is motivated by recent results of Etheridge, Freeman, and Penington [EFP2017] and Huang and Durrett [HD2021], who proved convergence to classical mean curvature flow (MCF) for certain spatial stochastic processes, up until the first time when singularities of MCF form. Our arguments rely on the level-set method and the abstract approach to front propagation introduced by Barles and Souganidis [BS1998].
  This approach is amenable to stochastic models equipped with moment duals which satisfy certain general and verifiable properties. Our main results improve the existing results in several ways, first by removing regularity conditions on the initial data, and second by establishing convergence beyond the formation of singularities of MCF. In particular, we obtain a general convergence theorem which holds globally in time. This is then applied to all of the models considered in [EFP2017] and [HD2021].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multidimensional distributions with heavy tails attracted recently the attention of several papers on Applied Probability. However, the most of the works of the last decades are focused on multivariate regular variation, while the rest of the heavy-tailed distribution classes were not studied extensively. About the multivariate subexponentiality we can find several approximations, but none of them get established widely. Having in mind the single big jump and further the multivariate subexponentiality suggested by Samorodnitsky and Sun (2016), we introduce the multivariate long, dominatedly and constistently varying distribution classes. We examine the closure properties of these classes with respect to product convolution, to scale mixture and convolution of random vectors. Especially in the class of multivariate subexponential and dominatedly varying distributions we provide the asymptotic behavior of the random vector and its normalized Levy measure, through their linear combination, that leads to their characterization. Furthermore, we study the single big jump in finite and in random sums of random vectors, permitting some dependence structures, which contain the independence as special case. Finally, we present an application on the asymptotic evaluation of the present value of the total claims in a risk model, with common Poisson counting process, general financial factors and independent, identically distributed claims, with common multivariate subexponential distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Height-offset variables (HOVs) provide a mechanism, known as "pinning at infinity", to lift gradient Gibbs measures (GGMs) - describing interface increments - to proper Gibbs measures that describe absolute heights. Starting from Sheffield's seminal framework, we study HOVs for nearest-neighbor integer-valued gradient models on regular trees, under broad classes of transfer operators requiring only finite second moments and without assuming convexity. We first establish the existence of HOVs as martingale limits, prove the infinite differentiability of their Lebesgue densities, and demonstrate exponential concentration for the associated pinned Gibbs measures. Next we uncover a fundamental trade-off, as the Gibbs measures arising by "pinning at infinity" paradoxically lose several desirable structural properties. We rigorously show that they lose tree-automorphism invariance, the tree-indexed Markov chain property, and extremality within the class of Gibbs measures. Our analysis relies on martingale theory, novel past- and future-tail decompositions, and infinite product representations for moment generating functions, and it applies to free GGMs, as well as to GGMs of height-period two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the bullet process, a gun fires bullets in the same direction at independent random speeds, and with independent random time delays between firings. When two bullets collide, they vanish. The critical velocity $v_c$ is the slowest speed the first bullet can take and still have positive probability of surviving forever. We characterize the critical velocity via a random variable determined by the sequence of speeds and delays, which we show almost surely equals $v_c$. In turn we prove other facts about the process, including that infinitely many bullets survive when the velocity distribution has finite support. Along the way we answer a question from Broutin--Marckert (2020), showing that if a bullet survives, it does so in all but finitely many truncations of the process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with independent identically distributed edge processes. Our aim is to describe the joint evolution of the entries of a subgraph count vector. The main result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem: we establish, under an appropriate centering and scaling, the joint functional convergence of the vector of subgraph counts to a specific multidimensional Gaussian process. The result holds under mild assumptions on the edge processes, most notably a Lipschitz-type condition.</description>

Abstract: Let A be an n-by-n symmetric random matrix whose upper-triangular entries are independent and follow possibly non-identical subgaussian distributions. This paper investigates the spectral properties of A, including its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our first result gives an upper tail bound for eigenvalue gaps. We show that for k &lt;= n / log n, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n - k, and epsilon &gt; 0,
  P( lambda_{i+k} - lambda_i &lt;= epsilon * n^{-1/2} ) &lt;= (C * epsilon)^{(k^2 + k) / 2} + exp(-c * n).
  This bound is optimal when k is fixed.
  Our second result provides a quantitative estimate on the small singular values of A. Combining a recent theorem of Han Yi (arXiv:2506.01155), we prove that for c * log n &lt;= k &lt;= sqrt(n) and epsilon &gt;= 0,
  P( sigma_{n-k+1}(A) &lt;= k * epsilon * n^{-1/2} ) &lt;= (C * epsilon)^{c * k^2} + exp(-c * k * n).
  Finally, using a distance-based analytical framework for eigenvalue gaps, we obtain quantitative bounds for singular values of principal submatrices and for delocalization of eigenvectors. In particular, we establish a no-gap delocalization estimate for eigenvectors of A, improving a result of Rudelson and Vershynin (Geom. Funct. Anal. 26 (2016), 1716-1776).</description>

      <title>On the zero-noise limit for SDE's singular at the initial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-noise limit for SDE's driven by Brownian motion with a divergence-free drift singular at the initial time and prove that a unique probability measure concentrated on the integral curves of the drift is selected. More precisely, we prove uniqueness of the zero-noise limit for divergence-free drifts in $L^1_{loc}((0,T];BV(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^q((0,T);L^p(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))$ where $p$ and $q$ satisfy a Prodi-Serrin condition. The vector field constructed by Depauw [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003] lies in this class and we show that for almost every intial datum, the zero-noise limit selects a probability measure concentrated on several distinct integral curves of this vector field.</description>

Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>The stochastic heat inclusion with fractional time driven by time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion driven by additive time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise. The fractional time derivative is interpreted as the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2).$ We show the following: \\ a) If a solution exists, then it is a fixed point of a specific set-valued map.\\ b) Conversely, any fixed point of this map is a solution of the heat inclusion.\\ c) Finally, we show that there is at least one fixed point of this map, thereby proving that there is at least one solution of the time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion.
  A solution $Y(t,x)$ is called \emph{mild} if $\E[Y^2(t,x)] &lt; \infty$ for all $t,x$. We show that the solution is mild if\\ $\alpha=1$ \&amp; $d=1,$ \ or \ $\alpha \geq 1$ \&amp; $d\in \{1,2\}$.
  On the other hand, if $\alpha &lt; 1$ we show that the solution is not mild for any space dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce local blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Strong disorder for Stochastic Heat Flow and 2D Directed Polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a universal measure-valued process providing a notion of solution to the ill-defined 2D stochastic heat equation. We investigate the SHF in the regime of large time and large disorder strength, proving a sharp form of local extinction: we identify the rate at which the distribution collapses to zero. We also identify the spatial scale governing the transition from vanishing to diverging mass, and from extinction to an averaged behavior. Corresponding results are established for the partition functions of 2D directed polymers, which yield precise free energy estimates. Our proof refines classical change of measure and coarse-graining techniques, introducing new ideas of independent interest. Our findings provide novel insight into the 2D stochastic heat equation regularized via space-time discretization: for any regime of supercritical disorder strength $\beta$, including the case where $\beta &gt; 0$ is kept fixed, the solution exhibits fluctuations on a superdiffusive scale.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the form $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove the central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions and compute the subleading correction to the free energy. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'].
  Our results allow us to give a large $N$ expansion up to $o(N)$ of the log-volume of the unit balls of $N\times N$ self-adjoint matrices for the $p$-Schatten norms and to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture. For the latter, we consider the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$ and the uniform distributions on these same Schatten balls for $N$ large enough. While the case $p&gt;3$, $q=1, r=2$, was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $q\geq1$ and $r\geq2$ an even integer. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

      <title>The Mixed Birth-death/death-Birth Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\lambda$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\lambda=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\lambda=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are "almost regular," in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r&gt;1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\Omega_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\{d_1, d_2\}$ with $d_1 \leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\lambda$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \alpha^4)$ for all $\lambda$, where $\alpha = d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits and Strong Consistency on Binary Non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the unsupervised node classification problem on random hypergraphs under the non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model (HSBM) with two equal-sized communities. In this model, edges appear independently with probabilities depending only on the labels of their vertices. We identify the threshold for strong consistency, expressed in terms of the Generalized Hellinger distance. Below this threshold, strong consistency is impossible, and we derive the Information-Theoretic (IT) lower bound on the expected mismatch ratio. Above the threshold, the parameter space is typically divided into two disjoint regions. When only the aggregated adjacency matrices are accessible, while one-stage algorithms accomplish strong consistency with high probability in the region far from the threshold, they fail in the region closer to the threshold. We propose a new refinement algorithm which, in conjunction with the initial estimation, provably achieves strong consistency throughout the entire region above the threshold, and attains the IT lower bound when below the threshold, proving its optimality. This novel refinement algorithm applies the power iteration method to a weighted adjacency matrix, where the weights are determined by hyperedge sizes and the initial label estimate. Unlike the constant degree regime where a subset selection of uniform layers is necessary to enhance clustering accuracy, in the scenario with diverging degrees, each uniform layer contributes non-negatively to clustering accuracy. Therefore, aggregating information across all uniform layers yields better performance than using any single layer alone.</description>

Abstract: We consider Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) for uniformly distributed sequences of random numbers with a dependency structure. More specifically, we treat two classes of dependent random variables which have widely been studied in the literature, namely sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus. We show that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that, under some mild assumptions, the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</description>

      <title>On the Age of Information in Single-Server Queues with Aged Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that quantifies the freshness of data in systems where timely updates are critical. Most state-of-the-art methods typically assume that packets enter the monitored system with zero age, neglecting situations, such as those prevalent in multi-hop networks or distributed sensing, where packets experience prior delays. In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero initial age. We derive an expression for the average AoI in this setting, showing that it equals the standard AoI plus a correction term involving the correlation between packet age and inter-departure times. When these variables are independent, the expression simplifies to an additive correction equal to the mean initial age. In cases where the dependency structure is unknown, we also establish lower and upper bounds for the correction term. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across various queueing scenarios, such as forwarding, tandem, and retrial queues. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of the derived bounds on a tandem composed of several queues, a model that has not yet been analytically solved from an age perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of continuous-time bivariate phase-type distributions for modeling dependencies from common shocks. The construction uses continuous-time Markov processes that evolve identically until an internal common-shock event, after which they diverge into independent processes. We derive and analyze key risk measures for this new class, including joint cumulative distribution functions, dependence measures, and conditional risk measures. Theoretical results establish analytically tractable properties of the model. For parameter estimation, we employ efficient gradient-based methods. Applications to both simulated and real-world data illustrate the ability to capture common-shock dependencies effectively. Our analysis also demonstrates that common-shock continuous phase-type distributions may capture dependencies that extend beyond those explicitly triggered by common shocks.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Risk Sensitive Control of Diffusions under a General Structural Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the infinite-horizon average (ergodic) risk sensitive control problem for diffusion processes under a general structural hypothesis: there is a partition of state space into two subsets, where the controlled diffusion process satisfies a Foster-Lyapunov type drift condition in one subset, under any stationary Markov control, while the near-monotonicity condition is satisfied with the running cost function being inf-compact in its complement. Under these conditions, we completely characterize the optimal stationary Markov controls. To prove this, we consider an inf-compact perturbation to the running cost over the entire space such that the resulting ergodic risk sensitive control problem is well-defined and then use the corresponding existing results. The heart of the analysis lies in exploiting the variational formula of exponential functionals of Brownian motion and applying it to the objective exponential cost function of the controlled diffusion. This representation facilitates us to view the risk sensitive cost for any stationary Markov control as the optimal value of a control problem of an extended diffusion involving a new auxiliary control where the optimal criterion is to maximize the associated long-run average cost criterion that is a difference of the original running cost and an extra term that is quadratic in the auxiliary control. The main difficulty in using this approach lies in the fact that tightness of mean empirical measures of the extended diffusion is not a priori implied by the analogous tightness property of the original diffusion. We overcome this by establishing a priori estimates for the extended diffusion associated with the nearly optimal auxiliary controls.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/\Lambda$ improve under convolution by $\mu$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality for irreducible representations which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality.</description>
