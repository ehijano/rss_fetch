      <title>Unified Mechanics on Thermodynamics, Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical and quantum mechanics laws are rebuilt in the frame of new thermodynamics. Heat is the sum of kinetic energy, system work, and system potential of a system, while force is the heat gradients over distance. Hence, collision, temperature difference, and molar volume gradients are the sources of forces. The collision creates symmetric forces, i.e., mutual repulsion or attraction. The other sources produce asymmetric forces driving rotation and spin (self-rotation). Interaction does not need a medium. As achievements, 1) a brief and general equation is derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction: [equation] without using any assumption; 2) electrons and protons are electroneutral, while neutrons are the cold protons with delta T = 6.01 x 10 power 9 K, thus, the heat of nuclear reaction is about 9.18 MeV; 3) atom has isothermal and non-isothermal orbits. Each orbit accommodates 2 electrons with opposite spins; 4) the first ionization energies of elements reported in the references are close to the kinetic energies calculated in this paper; 5) the strengths of chemical bonds and H-bonds are calculated, comparable with the experimental data; 6) vibrations of chemical bonds are discussed which disclose the source of alpha in the system potential. It is suggested that transferring heat from the hot electrons and nuclei to the cold ones makes a network in the cosmos. Photons are the messengers on the way rather than the roaming travelers.</description>

      <title>Does quantum mechanics apply to macroscopic objects? How to define macro?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to Quantum Mechanics a narrow wave-packet of the center of mass of any macroscopic object should smear out after some time. The problem is usually waved out by assuming that due to their heavy masses this occurs over astronomical times. Without a clear definition of macroscopic objects this remains ambiguous. On the other hand, Quantum Mechanics allows and energetically even prefers largely smeared out c.m. states that never been seen. Why is this the real state of the world we know? Does it suggest a micro-macro threshold with different theoretical descriptions? Does offer micro-miniaturization a hope for answering these questions?</description>
