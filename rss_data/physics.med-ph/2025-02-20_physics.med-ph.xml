      <title>Impact of Optic Nerve Tortuosity, Globe Proptosis, and Size on Retinal Ganglion Cell Thickness Across General, Glaucoma, and Myopic Populations: Insights from the UK Biobank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of optic nerve tortuosity (ONT), and the interaction of globe proptosis and globe size on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thickness, using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, across general, glaucoma, and myopic populations. Methods: We analyzed 17,970 eyes from the UKBiobank cohort (ID 76442), including 371 glaucoma and 2481 myopic eyes. AI models segmented structures from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular magnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe proptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole (ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models assessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all populations. Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both MRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP distance (r = 0.065, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.206, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). The same was true for glaucoma (r = 0.140, p &lt; 0.01, and r = 0.256, p &lt; 0.01), and for myopia (r = 0.071, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.100, p &lt; 0.0001). GEE models revealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of thinner RNFL in all populations. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and proptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from biomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance, particularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe size and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health. These findings highlight the role of orbit structures in RGC axonal health and warrant further exploration of the biomechanical relationship between the orbit and optic nerve.</description>

      <title>Muscle Activation Estimation by Optimzing the Musculoskeletal Model for Personalized Strength and Conditioning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal models are pivotal in the domains of rehabilitation and resistance training to analyze muscle conditions. However, individual variability in musculoskeletal parameters and the immeasurability of some internal biomechanical variables pose significant obstacles to accurate personalized modelling. Furthermore, muscle activation estimation can be challenging due to the inherent redundancy of the musculoskeletal system, where multiple muscles drive a single joint. This study develops a whole-body musculoskeletal model for strength and conditioning training and calibrates relevant muscle parameters with an electromyography-based optimization method. By utilizing the personalized musculoskeletal model, muscle activation can be subsequently estimated to analyze the performance of exercises. Bench press and deadlift are chosen for experimental verification to affirm the efficacy of this approach.</description>

      <title>Pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation as a predictor of functional severity of coronary stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to evaluate the functional significance of coronary stenosis by analyzing low-level radiomic features of the pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) surrounding the lesions, which are indicative of its inflammation status. Methods: A dataset of 72 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was analyzed, with 3D segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from a prior study. Centerlines of the main epicardial branches were automatically extracted, and lesions identified using Gaussian kernel regression to estimate healthy branch caliber. PCAT features were computed per vessel following guideline recommendations and per lesion within a region extending radially for two vessel radii. Features like fat volume and mean attenuation (FAI) were analyzed for their relationship with CFD-derived hemodynamic biomarkers, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) and wall shear stress (WSS). These features also informed a machine learning (ML) model for classifying potentially ischemic lesions. Results: PCAT exhibited, on average, higher attenuation in the presence of hemodynamically significant lesions (i.e., FFR &lt; 0.80), although this difference was of limited statistical significance. The ML classifier, trained on PCAT features, successfully distinguished potentially ischemic lesions, yielding average accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion: PCAT attenuation is correlated with the functional status of coronary stenosis and can be used to inform ML models for predicting potential ischemia. Significance: PCAT features, readily available from CCTA, can be used to predict the hemodynamic characteristics of a lesion without the need for an invasive FFR examination.</description>

      <title>Application of autoresonance in rapid beam extraction of synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues. However, due to the limitation of number of particles, achieving FLASH effect in a compact heavy-ion synchrotron requires a short extraction time of tens of milliseconds, which is challenging for conventional RF-KO method. The conventional RF-KO method excites particle amplitudes through local resonance, but the extremely high dose rates required for FLASH therapy necessitate large excitation amplitudes that current driver technologies cannot adequately provide within the required millisecond scale. To address this challenge, this paper introduces autoresonance into resonant extraction for the first time. Leveraging the principles of autoresonance, this technique achieves whole beam amplitude resonance through frequency locking, facilitating rapid and uniform beam extraction using a single-period frequency sweeping excitation. Compared to conventional slow extraction methods, this innovative approach requires only the addition of an octupole magnet. We derived the autoresonance threshold under rapid extraction conditions and conducted some simulations. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that this method can achieve millisecond scale extraction, validating the effectiveness of the proposed Autoresonance Rapid Extraction method.</description>

      <title>Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (SR$^2$-CSD) of Diffusion MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is crucial for estimating white matter fiber orientations using diffusion MRI data. A relevant parameter in CSD is the maximum order $l_{max}$ used in the spherical harmonics series, influencing the angular resolution of the Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs). Lower $l_{max}$ values produce smoother and more stable estimates, but result in reduced angular resolution. Conversely, higher $l_{max}$ values, as employed in the Super-Resolved CSD variant, are essential for resolving narrow inter-fiber angles but lead to spurious lobes due to increased noise sensitivity. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD) approach, incorporating spatial priors into the CSD framework. This method leverages spatial information among adjacent voxels, enhancing the stability and noise robustness of FOD estimations. SR$^2$-CSD facilitates the practical use of Super-Resolved CSD by including a J-invariant auto-calibrated total variation FOD denoiser. We evaluated the performance of SR$^2$-CSD against standard CSD and Super-Resolved CSD using phantom numerical data and various real brain datasets, including a test-retest sample of six subjects scanned twice. In phantom data, SR$^2$-CSD outperformed both CSD and Super-Resolved CSD, reducing the angular error (AE) by approximately half and the peak number error (PNE) by a factor of three across all noise levels considered. In real data, SR$^2$-CSD produced more continuous FOD estimates with higher spatial-angular coherency. In the test-retest sample, SR$^2$-CSD consistently yielded more reproducible estimates, with reduced AE, PNE, mean squared error, and increased angular correlation coefficient between the FODs estimated from the two scans for each subject.</description>

Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMRI, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent "fingerprint". Here we reveal the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMRI signal, classify all 21 invariants of diffusion and covariance tensors in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Previously studied dMRI contrasts are expressed via 7 invariants, while the remaining 14 provide novel complementary information. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine 3-4 most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMRI signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>On a revised concept of an event that allows linking nanodosimetry and microdosimetry in nanometric sites with macroscopic dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reviews the concepts of an event used in micro- and nanodosimetry and analyzes how single event distributions could theoretically be derived from probability distributions related to interactions of the primary particle which produce secondary electrons. It is shown that the corresponding mathematical expressions of conditional ionization cluster size distributions are alike those for the single event frequency distribution of energy imparted, particularly when all tracks are considered which intersect the volume in which interactions of the primary particle can result in energy deposits in the site. Track structure simulations of proton with energies between 1 MeV and 100 MeV are used to study how the occurrence of events depends on site size, beam radius, and proton energy. The range of impact parameters of particle tracks that contribute to energy imparted in a site appears not to depend on whether any energy deposits or only energy deposits by ionizations are considered. Since there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between tracks passing a site and the occurrence of an event, it is proposed to use the fluence for which on average one event occurs as a substitute for single events. For protons, the product of this fluence and the site cross section or the average number of tracks necessary for an event shows an interesting dependence on site size and particle energy with asymptotic values close to unity for large sites and proton energies below 10 MeV. For a proton energy of 1 MeV, a minimum of the number of tracks is observed for sites between 5 nm and 10 nm diameter. The relative differences between the numbers of track per event on average obtained with different options of Geant4-DNA are in the order of 10 % and illustrate the need for further investigations into cross-section datasets and their uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Low Cost Cardiopulmonary Resuscitaion Device | A Novel Mechatronics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac arrest is very common nowadays. Sudden heart attack is a condition where the heart suddenly stops beating causing a significant decrease in blood flow to the brain. The first step in medical point of view is for a patient experiencing sudden heart attack is Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).Moreover, compression rate needed for CPR process is far beyond for humans to provide manually. So, there is intense need of mechanical device which can perform resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation device is used to augment the blood flow and maintain hemodynamic cycle of human body. CPR device is proposed to meet the effective and unique blood flow mechanism, feedback system. In term of effective and unique blood flow mechanism design and fabrication of low cost cardiopulmonary resuscitation device based on principle of CPR and two concepts. It is combined Sterno-Thoracic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The "cardiac pump" generates blood flow by squeezing blood out of the heart as the sternum is depressed. The "thoracic pump" increases intrathoracic pressure due to elastic recoil of ribs. In order to meet the American Heart Association standard guidelines a feedback system has established through closed loop control system, and integration of processing controllers. Specifically, a small HMI (Human machine interface) device has been established to control the whole mechanism which would be used for child, Adults and Senior citizens as a manual intelligence system. Henceforth, feedback system act as backbone for this device.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Neural Style Transfer for MRI Field-Transfer Reconstruction with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in MRI reconstruction have demonstrated remarkable success through deep learning-based models. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large-scale, task-specific datasets, making reconstruction in data-limited settings a critical yet underexplored challenge. While regularization by denoising (RED) leverages denoisers as priors for reconstruction, we propose Regularization by Neural Style Transfer (RNST), a novel framework that integrates a neural style transfer (NST) engine with a denoiser to enable magnetic field-transfer reconstruction. RNST generates high-field-quality images from low-field inputs without requiring paired training data, leveraging style priors to address limited-data settings. Our experiment results demonstrate RNST's ability to reconstruct high-quality images across diverse anatomical planes (axial, coronal, sagittal) and noise levels, achieving superior clarity, contrast, and structural fidelity compared to lower-field references. Crucially, RNST maintains robustness even when style and content images lack exact alignment, broadening its applicability in clinical environments where precise reference matches are unavailable. By combining the strengths of NST and denoising, RNST offers a scalable, data-efficient solution for MRI field-transfer reconstruction, demonstrating significant potential for resource-limited settings.</description>
