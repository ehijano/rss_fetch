      <title>Zeros of Random Sections on Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sections of line bundles on 2 dimensional surfaces in 3 dimensional space can have many distinct shapes. For practical purposes we prefer smooth sections that are visibly easy to follow. This is why smoothing operators have been developed on discrete surfaces as in the inspirational paper "Globally Optimal Direction Fields" [Knoeppel et al. 2013] that can be applied to any section to return another smoother section. We are interested to make predictions on one aspect of the resulting smoothed section's structure, namely position of its signed zeros. The zeros are the most noticeable feature of a section where the section values circles around a specific point.
  The purpose of this thesis is to predict the distribution of the smoothed section's signed zeros with multiplicity that are given by applying the smoothing operator to randomly generated sections of hermitian line bundles on closed simplicial complexes. This will be done in a discrete setting consequently meaning that we will compute the expected sum of indices on each face. Why and how we do this is this thesis' purpose to explain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a dynamical version of the second fundamental form, we generalize a recent result of Filip--Fisher--Lowe to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we show that a real-analytic negatively s-curved magnetic system on a closed real-analytic manifold has only finitely many closed totally s-magnetic hypersurfaces, unless the magnetic 2-form is trivial and the underlying metric is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Einstein Finsler Warped Product Manifolds of Non-positive or Non-negative Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of warped product plays an important role in Riemannian geometry moreover in geodesic metric spaces. The warped product was first introduced by Bishop and O'Neill to study Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature.Warped products have been mainly used to construct new examples of Riemannian manifolds with prescribed curvature conditions. This construction can be extended for Finslerian metrics with some minor restrictions. This is motivated by Asanov's papers, where some models of relativity theory are described through the warped product of Finsler metrics. These metrics are in the form of $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics, which are the generalization of the Randers metrics; which are being asymmetric Finsler metrics in four-dimensional space-time. The product was later extended to the warped product case of Finsler manifolds by the work of Kozma, Peter and Verge.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian perspectives of classical Lie groups and Cartan involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical noncompact reductive Lie group $G$ admits a compactification $\overline{G}$ as a Riemannian symmetric space by He. First, we provide a unified construction of these compactifications via Grassmannian geometry and realize the group structures in terms of the geometry of configurations of linear subspaces.
  Second, we show that the Cartan involution $\rho$ on $G$ extends uniquely to an isometric involution $\bar{\rho}$ on $\overline{G}$ and $\overline{G}^{\bar{\rho}} = G^{\rho} = K$, the maximal compact subgroup of $G$.
  Third, we show that $\eta(g) = \rho(g)^{-1}$ extends uniquely to an isometric involution $\bar{\eta}$ on $\overline{G}$ and $\overline{G}^{\bar{\eta}} = G_c/K$, the compact symmetric space dual to $(G^\eta)_0 = G/K$. This provides a natural generalization of the classical Borel embeddings $G/K \hookrightarrow G_c/K$. Furthermore, $K$ and $G_c/K$ form a complementary pair of reflective submanifolds in $\overline{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by statistical de Rham Hodge operators and the spectral functionals, we carry on some promotion to spectral functionals to noncommutative fields, and associate them with the noncommutative residue on manifolds with boundary. We prove the Dabrowski-Sitarz-Zalecki type theorem for statistical de Rham Hodge operators on manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Reducible Holonomy in Closed Torsion Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to show that a connection with closed skewsymmetric torsion and reducible holonomy admits a locally defined Riemannian submersion together with a projected geometry on the base. We reframe known submersion results for non-K\"ahler Bismut Hermite Einstein manifolds and sHKT structures in this context. For homogeneous SKT structures on semi-simple Lie groups we obtain the holonomy decomposition leading to holomorphic submersions over generalized flag manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing both hyperbolic framed surfaces and one-parameter families of hyperbolic framed curves, we introduce the concept of hyperbolic generalized framed surfaces and establish their relations in hyperbolic 3-space. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a smooth surface to be a hyperbolic generalized framed base surface, followed by an analysis of the singularities of hyperbolic generalized framed base surfaces. Additionally, relations between hyperbolic generalized framed surfaces, generalized framed surfaces and lightcone framed surfaces are explored. As an application of hyperbolic generalized framed surfaces, we investigate the properties of horocyclic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolic domains in Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate domains in Minkowski space that are Gromov hyperbolic with respect to a Kobayashi-like metric introduced by Markowitz in the 1980s. For convex, future complete domains, Gromov hyperbolicity is shown to be equivalent to the stable acausality of the boundary. An analogous characterization is obtained for bounded, convex, causally convex domains in terms of the stable acausality of their Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose causal boundaries. Our approach is based on explicit comparisons between the Markowitz metric, the Sormani--Vega null distance and the quasi-hyperbolic metric. We also make use of dynamical arguments similar to those of Benoist and Zimmer in projective and complex geometry. Finally, we compare the Markowitz metric to the Hilbert metric.</description>

      <title>The functor between two categories of $\mathbb{Z}-$graded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines $\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifolds as semiformal homogeneity structures, comparing two polynomial filtrations from their local models. In finite dimensions, these are componentwise equivalent, yielding isomorphic graded completions; generally, one induces a finer topology. By the Batchelor-Gawedzki-type theorem (Kotov--Salnikov), every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold over base $M$ is noncanonically isomorphic to one associated with its canonical $\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle (Batchelor-Gawedzki bundle). In finite dimensions, this is the formal neighborhood of the zero section with the induced homogeneity structure. Kotov-Salnikov's graded Borel lemma extends weight-$k$ functions from the formal neighborhood to smooth ones of the same weight. Here, this generalizes to a Borel--Whitney theorem: homogeneity morphisms of formal neighborhoods lift to smooth homogeneity maps between Batchelor-Gawedzki bundles. Categorically, let $\mathsf{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the category of finite-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vector bundles with homogeneity morphisms, and $\mathsf{Man}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ the category of finite-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifolds. The functor $\mathsf{F}\colon \mathsf{B}_{\mathbb{Z}} \to \mathsf{Man}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ sends bundles to formal neighborhoods of their zero sections. The graded Batchelor-Gawedzki and Borel-Whitney theorems imply $\mathsf{F}$ is full and surjective on objects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of Translating Solitons to Mean Curvature Flow in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of translating solitons for the Mean Curvature Flow (MCF) in hyperbolic space of dimension $n+1\ge 3$. More specifically, we establish that horospheres are dynamically stable as radial graphical solutions to MCF. To that end, we construct rotationally invariant translators analogous to the winglike solitons introduced by Clutterbuck, Schn\"urer and Schulze, which serve as barriers in an argument based on White's avoidance principle and the strong maximum principle for parabolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Integration by Parts and Sobolev Spaces on Vector Bundles: A Unified Global Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops a unified framework for the theory of Sobolev spaces on vector bundles over Riemannian manifolds. The analytical core of our approach is a rigorous higher-order geometric integration by parts formula, which characterizes the formal adjoint of the covariant derivative. This identity is established for arbitrary manifolds, requiring no assumptions on completeness or compactness. While these results are fundamental to global analysis, explicit and direct proofs are often elusive in the literature or rely on overly sophisticated machinery that overshadows the underlying geometry. To bridge this gap, we establish sharp local-to-global norm equivalence estimates and provide streamlined, self-contained proofs for the Meyers-Serrin theorem on general manifolds, as well as the Sobolev embedding and Rellich-Kondrashov theorems for the compact case. By prioritizing intrinsic global arguments over ad hoc coordinate patching, this work provides a modern and accessible foundation for the study of Sobolev spaces on bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a valuation-theoretic framework for studying tangent cones of torsion-free sheaves on algebraic varieties. To analyze these objects, we introduce a slope stability theory, including the Harder-Narasimhan filtrations, for finitely generated $\mathbb{R}$-graded modules over finitely generated $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$-graded algebras. Using it, we show that there is a canonically determined tangent cone of torsion-free sheaves, up to the expected equivalence ambiguity, for quasi-regular valuations, which generalize Chen-Sun [3].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the work of Gal'perin (Comm. Math. Phys. 154: 63-84, 1993), we investigate generalizations of the concepts of centroids and static equilibrium points of a convex body in spherical, hyperbolic and normed spaces. In addition, we examine the minimum number of equilibrium points a $2$- or $3$-dimensional convex body can have in these spaces. In particular, we show that every plane convex body in any of these spaces has at least four equilibrium points, and that there are mono-monostatic convex bodies in $3$-dimensional spherical, hyperbolic, and certain normed spaces. Our results are generalizations of results of Domokos, Papadopoulos and Ruina (J. Elasticity 36: 59-66, 1994), and V\'arkonyi and Domokos (J. Nonlinear Sci. 16: 255-281, 2006) for convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new construction of subcomplexes associated with a truncated multicomplex. Inspired by the machinery of spectral sequences, this construction yields a collection of interrelated subcomplexes whose differentials coincide with the spectral sequence differentials. These complexes refine the Rumin complex and retain the cohomology of the underlying multicomplex, providing a new tool for the study of subRiemannian geometry, particularly on Carnot groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove an explicit upper bound on the number of rational points on a smooth projective curve of genus at least two over a number field. This gives explicit constants in the uniform Mordell conjecture proposed by Mazur and proved by Vojta, Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger, and K\"uhne. The main body of this paper consists of two parts: Part I for arithmetic estimates and Part II for analytic estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An irreducible representation of a reductive Lie algebra, when restricted to a Cartan subalgebra, decomposes into weights with multiplicity. The first part of this paper outlines a procedure to compute symmetric polynomials (e.g., power sums) of this multiset of weights, as functions of the highest weight. Next, let G be a connected reductive complex algebraic group with maximal torus T. We express the restrictions of the Chern classes of irreducible representations of G to T, as polynomial functions in the highest weight. We do the same for Stiefel-Whitney classes of orthogonal representations.</description>

      <title>Complete asymptotics in the formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three categories of mathematical results concerning quiescent big bang singularities: the derivation of asymptotics in a symmetry class; the construction of spacetimes given initial data on the singularity; and the proof of big bang formation in the absence of symmetries, including the proof of stable big bang formation. In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity. However, the results are more general and can potentially be used to derive similar conclusions in other gauges.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity of capacity under pointed intrinsic flat convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the capacity of a compact set in $\mathbb R^n$ generalizes readily to noncompact Riemannian manifolds and, with more substantial work, to metric spaces (where multiple natural definitions of capacity are possible). Motivated by analytic and geometric considerations, and in particular Jauregui's definition of capacity-volume mass and Jauregui and Lee's results on the lower semicontinuity of the ADM mass and Huisken's isoperimetric mass, we investigate how the capacity functional behaves when the background spaces vary. Specifically, we allow the background spaces to consist of a sequence of local integral current spaces converging in the pointed Sormani--Wenger intrinsic flat sense. For the case of volume-preserving ($\mathcal{VF}$) convergence, we prove two theorems that demonstrate an upper semicontinuity phenomenon for the capacity: one version is for balls of a fixed radius centered about converging points; the other is for Lipschitz sublevel sets. Our approach is motivated by Portegies' investigation of the semicontinuity of eigenvalues under $\mathcal{VF}$ convergence. We include examples to show the semicontinuity may be strict, and that the volume-preserving hypothesis is necessary. Finally, there is a discussion on how capacity and our results may be used towards understanding the general relativistic total mass in non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Formal structure of scalar curvature in generalized K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on works of Boulanger and Goto, we show that Goto's scalar curvature is the moment map for an action of generalized Hamiltonian automorphisms of the associated Courant algebroid, constrained by the choice of an adapted volume form. We derive an explicit formula for Goto's scalar curvature, and show that it is constant for generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. Restricting to the generically symplectic type case, we realize the generalized K\"ahler class as the complexified orbit of the Hamiltonian action above. This leads to a natural extension of Mabuchi's metric and $K$-energy, implying a conditional uniqueness result. Finally, in this setting we derive a Calabi-Matsushima-Lichnerowicz obstruction and a Futaki invariant.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-harmonic forms and spinors on stable minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:N\rightarrow (M,g)$ be an oriented (or spin), complete, stable, minimal, immersed hypersurface. In this paper we establish various vanishing theorems for the space of $L^2$-harmonic forms and spinors (in the spin case) under suitable positive curvature assumptions on the ambient manifold. Our results in the setting of forms extend to higher dimensions and more general ambient Riemannian manifolds previous vanishing theorems due to Tanno \cite{Tanno} and Zhu \cite{Zhu}. In the setting of spin manifolds our results allow to conclude, for instance, that any oriented, complete, stable, minimal, immersed hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^m$ or $\mathbb{S}^m$ carries no non-trivial $L^2$-harmonic spinors. Finally, analogous results are proved for strongly stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove the removable singularity theorem for nonlocal minimal graphs. Specifically, we show that any nonlocal minimal graph in $\Omega \setminus K$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set and $K \subset \Omega$ is a compact set of $(s, 1)$-capacity zero, is indeed a nonlocal minimal graph in all of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>On FKM isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^n \times \mathbb{S}^n$ and new area-minimizing cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two generalizations for the celebrated works of Ferus-Karcher-M\"unzner \cite{FKM81} and Wang \cite{W94}. We first show that an isoparametric foliation on $\mathbb{S}^{2n+1}$ constructed by Ferus-Karcher-M\"unzner naturally yields an isoparametric foliation on its submanifold $\mathbb{S}^n \times \mathbb{S}^n$ with one same focal variety. The second part concerns area-minimizing cones; all known regular area-minimizing hypercones are realized as real algebraic varieties: isoparametric cones (cf. \cite{W94}). As a noteworthy application, we extend area-minimizing isoparametric hypercones in \cite{W94} to codimension-two cases, and obtain infinitely many families (each containing infinitely many members) of area-minimizing subcones of Simons cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a loop group (DPW-type) representation for minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the complex quadric $Q_{2}\cong \mathbb S^{2}\times \mathbb S^{2}$, formulated via a flat family of connections $\{\nabla^\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \mathbb S^{1}}$ on a trivial bundle. We prove that minimality is equivalent to the flatness of $\nabla^\lambda$ for all $\lambda$, describe the associated isometric $\mathbb S^{1}$-family, and establish a precise correspondence with minimal surfaces in $\mathbb S^{3}$ through their Gauss maps. Our framework unifies and streamlines earlier constructions (e.g., Castro--Urbano) and yields explicit families including $\mathbb R$-equivariant, radially symmetric, and trinoid-type examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use moving frame techniques to derive a notion of curvature for a class of piecewise-smooth Riemannian metrics called Regge metrics, showing that it is a measure that simultaneously satisfies the (weak) Cartan structure equations and the appropriate gauge transformation law. It turns out that this distributional curvature is equivalent to existing notions of densitized distributional curvature. We also investigate more closely the n = 2 case, where we prove the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Regge metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric and algebraic interplay between F-manifolds and a newly defined class of structures termed F$_\text{man}$-algebras. We specialize our study to the category of F-Lie groups, characterized by a Lie group whose associated commutative and associative product of vector fields is left-invariant. We construct a canonical connection on Lie groups uniquely determined by the F$_\text{man}$-algebraic data, and subsequently characterize its curvature tensor and holonomy Lie algebra. A central feature of our investigation is the introduction of the Poisson-algebra distribution, arising from a canonical Poisson subalgebra within the F$_\text{man}$-algebra. We establish the integrability of this distribution, which induces a foliation of the F-Lie group and facilitates a local splitting theorem. The theoretical framework is illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the Heisenberg Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interest of mathematicians in metric $f$-manifolds, in particular, almost contact metric manifolds, is motivated by the study of the geometry and dynamics of contact foliations, as well as their applications in physics. Weak metric $f$-manifolds, defined by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak (2022), open a new perspective on classical theory of $f$-manifolds and discover new applications. In this paper, we study manifolds of this type, called weak nearly ${\cal C}$-manifolds, which generalize almost ${\cal C}$-manifolds. We find conditions under which a $(2n+s)$-dimensional weak nearly ${\cal C}$-manifold becomes locally a Riemannian product, and characterize $(4+s)$-dimensional weak nearly ${\cal C}$-manifolds. The consequences of these theorems present new results for nearly ${\cal C}$-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Given a complex, simple Lie group $G$ of adjoint type, we introduce the notion of an Epstein-Poincar\'e surface associated to a $G$-oper. These surfaces generalize Epstein's classical construction for $G=PGL_2 (\mathbb{C})$. As an application, we provide a criterion that ensures that the holonomy of the oper is $\Delta-$Anosov. Finally, we discuss how the developing map of the oper interacts with domains of discontinuity of the holonomy (whenever Anosov) and the transversality properties it satisfies. Along the way, we provide a quick review of opers that we hope serves as a self-contained introduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Gromov's conjecture on the total mean curvature of fill-ins in various cases. Our methods are based on surgery to reduce the statement to fill-ins of spheres, which can be treated by instances of the positive mass theorem. For spin fill-ins, where we permit the mean curvature to take negative values, we build on a classical surgery result of Lawson-Michelsohn and a recent positive mass theorem with creases by Kazaras-Khuri-Lin. For non-spin fill-ins of spin manifolds, where we assume the mean curvature to be non-negative, we develop a novel quantitative surgery process to reduce the general situation to a result of Shi-Wang-Wei. We also treat the case of fill-ins of non-spin manifolds, provided there is a fixed positive lower bound on the mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Finite Index and Do Carmo Question for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any finite $\delta$-index hypersurface $M$ in ${\mathbb R}^{n+1}$ with constant mean curvature must be minimal, provided either of the following conditions holds:
  - the volume growth of $M$ is sub-exponential;
  - the Ricci curvature of $M$ satisfies $\operatorname{Ric}_M\geq -\frac{3(1-\delta)}{n-1}|A|^2g,$ where $A$ is the second fundamental form and $g$ is the metric on $M.$
  In the second case, our result further implies that, in addition to being minimal, such an $M$ must be a hyperplane.
  We emphasize that no restriction on the dimension is imposed. Moreover, the statement in the second case is new even for finite index hypersurfaces ($\delta=0$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the macroscopic version of Gromov's Urysohn width conjecture for scalar curvature is false in dimensions four and above. This is based on (1) a novel estimate on the codimension two Urysohn width of circle bundles over manifolds with large hypersphericity radius, and (2) a notion of ruling for Riemannian manifolds that yields circle bundles with total spaces admitting metrics of positive macroscopic scalar curvature. Along the way, we also show that Urysohn width is not continuous under Cheeger-Gromov collapsing limits. This article is a continuation of our study of metric invariants and scalar curvature for circle bundles over large Riemannian manifolds initiated in [KS25].</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: M.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N.~Nadirashvili [Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48] and T.~Hoff\-mann-Ostenhof, P.~Michor, and N.~Nadirashvili [Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188]. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In the first paper, $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the second, $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in these papers are not very detailed. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. We provide a survey of previous results (Chap.~1), as well as proofs of prerequisite theorems (Chap.~2). When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof of the upper bound, $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some eigenfunctions (Chap.~3). When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider the three boundary conditions, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains. More precisely, we prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$ (Chap.~4). We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected (Chap.~5). These chapters rely on Euler's inequality applied to the nodal graph and a careful analysis of eigenfunctions which optimize Euler's inequality. Chap.~6 contains related results (nodal line conjecture; Courant-sharp eigenvalues).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a strain-gradient model of plasticity as a $\Gamma$-limit of continuum bodies containing finitely-many edge-dislocations (in two dimensions). The key difference from previous such derivations is the elemental notion of a dislocation: we work in a continuum framework in which the lattice structure is represented by a smooth frame field, and the presence of a dislocation manifests in a circulation condition on that frame field; the resulting model is a Lagrangian approach with a multiplicative strain decomposition. The multiplicative nature of the geometric incompatibility generates many technical challenges, which require a systematic study of the geometry of bodies containing multiple dislocations, the definition of new notions of convergence, and the derivation of new geometric rigidity estimates pertinent to dislocated bodies. Our approach places the strain-gradient limit in a unified framework with other models of dislocations, which cannot be addressed within the "admissible strain" approach used in previous works.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and the solution map "coefficients-to-roots" is bounded. We prove continuity of this solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots as well as local lower semicontinuity of the area of the zero sets of hyperbolic polynomials. We also discuss applications for the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices and singular values.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the number of fixed points for circle actions on 10-dimensional almost complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a circle action on a compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, the lower bound on the number of fixed points is known in dimension up to 12 except 10. In this paper, we show that if the circle group acts on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, then there are at least 6 fixed points. This minimum is attained by $\mathbb{CP}^5$ and $S^6 \times \mathbb{CP}^2$. We establish this lower bound by showing that there does not exist a circle action on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with 4 fixed points.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum--Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X, \mathcal{F}, D)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D$ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Zariski--Lipman conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces, in the form of a foliated smoothness criterion, suggesting the appearance of saddle-nodes in the singularity reduction on singular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $\bf{\partial\bar\partial}$-lemma and several geometric applications (with an Appendix joint with Sheng Rao)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a $\partial\bar{\partial}$-type lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a certain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by X. Wan.
  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H. Esnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the $E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham complex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed locally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair with some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact K\"ahler manifolds.
  Furthermore, we establish the K\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem originally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O. Fujino previously addressed the K\"ahler case, our proof takes a different approach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>On differential smoothness of certain Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the differential smoothness of various five-dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. By analyzing the relationship between the number of generators and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, we provide structural obstructions to differential smoothness in specific algebraic families. In particular, we prove that certain two- and four-generator AS-regular algebras of global dimension five fail to admit a differential calculus, while a five-generator graded Clifford algebra provides a contrasting positive example.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the higher Steklov eigenvalues of graphs on surfaces.
  We obtain the upper bound of higher Steklov eigenvalues of a finite graph $G$ with boundary $B$ and genus $g$ by using metrical deformation via probability flows.
  Our result can be regarded as a discrete analogue of Karpukhin's bound in spectral geometry.
  Moreover, this result implies the upper bound of higher Laplacian eigenvalues given by Kelner, Lee, Price and Teng (Geom. Funct. Anal., 2011).</description>

      <title>A Morse-Bott unification of the Grassmannians of a symplectic vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a quadratic Morse-Bott function on the real Grassmannian of a symplectic vector space from a compatible linear complex structure. We show that its critical loci consist of linear subspaces that split into isotropic and complex parts and that its stable manifolds coincide with the orbits of the linear symplectomorphism group. These orbits generalize the Lagrangian, symplectic, isotropic, and coisotropic Grassmannians to include the Grassmannians of linear subspaces that are neither isotropic, coisotropic, nor symplectic. The negative gradient flow deformation retracts these spaces onto compact homogeneous spaces for the unitary group.</description>
