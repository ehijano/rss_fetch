      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>The existence of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,11,8,1,2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,11,8,1,2)$. We show that there are exactly two non-isomorphic directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,11,8,1,2)$ on which $PSL(2,8)$ acts as and automorphism group, transitively on the vertices of the digraphs. Both directed strongly regular graphs have $PSL(2,8):Z_3$ as the full automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Matching-star size Ramsey numbers under connectivity constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Caro, Patk\'os, and Tuza (2022) introduced the concept of connected Tur\'an number. We study a similar parameter in Ramsey theory. Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the size Ramsey number $\hat{r}(G_1,G_2)$ refers to the smallest number of edges in a graph $G$ such that for any red-blue edge-coloring of $G$, either a red subgraph $G_1$ or a blue subgraph $G_2$ is present in $G$. If we further restrict the host graph $G$ to be connected, we obtain the connected size Ramsey number, denoted as $\hat{r}_c(G_1,G_2)$. Erd\H{o}s and Faudree (1984) proved that $\hat r(nK_2,K_{1,m})=mn$ for all positive integers $m,n$. In this paper, we concentrate on the connected analog of this result. Rahadjeng, Baskoro, and Assiyatun (2016) provided the exact values of $\hat r_c(nK_2,K_{1,m})$ for $n=2,3$. We establish a more general result: for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m\ge (n^2+2pn+n-3)/2$, we have $\hat r_c(nK_{1,p},K_{1,m})=n(m+p)-1$. As a corollary, $\hat r_c(nK_2,K_{1,m})=nm+n-1$ for $m\ge (n^2+3n-3)/2$. We also propose a conjecture for the interested reader.</description>

      <title>A classification of well-behaved graph clustering schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.
  We study the class of all clustering methods that are monotone under addition of vertices and edges, phrasing this as a functoriality notion. We show that if additionally we require the methods to have no resolution limit in a strong sense, this is equivalent to a notion of representability, which requires them to be explainable and determined by a representing set of graphs. We show that representable clustering methods are always computable in polynomial time, and in any nowhere dense class they are computable in roughly quadratic time.
  Finally, we extend our definitions to the case of hierarchical clustering, and give a notion of representability for hierarchical clustering schemes.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal graphs for fan graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Nosal states that a graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $\lambda(G) &gt; \sqrt{m}$ contains a triangle. Nikiforov [Combin. Probab. Comput. 11 (2002)] extended this result to cliques by showing that if $\lambda (G) &gt; \sqrt{2m(1-1/r)}$, then $G$ contains a copy of $K_{r+1}$. Let $C_k^+$ be the graph obtained from a cycle $C_k$ by adding an edge to two vertices with distance two, and let $F_k$ be the friendship graph consisting of $k$ triangles that share a common vertex. Recently, Zhai, Lin and Shu [European J. Combin. 95 (2021)], Sun, Li and Wei [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)], and Li, Lu and Peng [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)] proved that if $ m\ge 8$ and $\lambda (G) \ge \frac{1}{2} (1+\sqrt{4m-3})$, then $G$ contains a copy of $C_5,C_5^+$ and $F_2$, respectively, unless $G=K_2\vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1$. In this paper, we give a unified extension by showing that such a graph contains a copy of $V_5$, where $V_5=K_1\vee P_4$ is the join of a vertex and a path on four vertices. Our result extends the aforementioned results since $C_5,C_5^+$ and $F_2$ are proper subgraphs of $V_5$. In addition, we prove that if $m\ge 33$ and $\lambda (G) \ge 1+ \sqrt{m-2}$, then $G$ contains a copy of $F_3$, unless $G=K_3\vee \frac{m-3}{3}K_1$. This confirms a conjecture on the friendship graph $F_k$ in the case $k=3$. Finally, we conclude some spectral extremal graph problems concerning the large fan graphs and wheel graphs.</description>

      <title>Total positivity and two inequalities by Athanasiadis and Tzanaki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be a (d-1)-dimensional simplicial complex and h^\Delta = (h_0^ ,.. , h_d) its h-vector. For a face uniform subdivision operation \F we write \Delta_\F for the subdivided complex and H_\F for the matrix such that h^{\Delta_\F} = H_\F h^\Delta.
  In connection with the real rootedness of symmetric decompositions Athanasiadis and Tzanaki studied for strictly positive h-vectors the inequalities
  h_0 / h_1 \leq h_1 / h_{d-1} \leq .... \leq h_d / h_0 and h_1 / h_{d-1} \geq ... \geq h_{d-2} / h_2 \geq h_{d-1} / h_1.
  In this paper we show that if the inequalities holds for a simplicial complex $\Delta$ and H_\F is TP_2 (all entries and two minors are non-negative) then the inequalities hold for \Delta_\F.
  We prove that if \F is the barycentric subdivision then H_\F is TP_2. If \F is the rth-edgewise subdivision then work of Diaconis and Fulman shows H_\F is TP_2. Indeed in this case by work of Mao and Wang H_\F is even TP.</description>

      <title>Toric Promotion with Reflections and Refractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on refraction billiards in dynamics, we introduce a notion of refraction for combinatorial billiards. This allows us to define a generalization of toric promotion that we call toric promotion with reflections and refractions, which is a dynamical system defined via a graph $G$ whose edges are partitioned into a set of reflection edges and a set of refraction edges. This system is a discretization of a billiards system in which a beam of light can pass through, reflect off of, or refract through each toric hyperplane in a toric arrangement. Vastly generalizing the main theorem known about toric promotion, we give a simple formula for the orbit structure of toric promotion with reflections and refractions when $G$ is a forest. We also completely describe the orbit sizes when $G$ is a cycle with an even number of refraction edges; this result is new even for ordinary toric promotion (i.e., when there are no refraction edges). When $G$ is a cycle of even size with no reflection edges, we obtain an interesting instance of the cyclic sieving phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Affine Demazure Weight Polytopes and Twisted Bruhat Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan and Borel subalgebras $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{g}$, affine Demazure modules are certain $U(\mathfrak{b})$-submodules of the irreducible highest-weight representations of $\mathfrak{g}$. We introduce here the associated affine Demazure weight polytopes, given by the convex hull of the $\mathfrak{h}$-weights of such a module. Using methods of geometric invariant theory, we determine inequalities which define these polytopes; these inequalities come in three distinct flavors, specified by the standard, opposite, or semi-infinite Bruhat orders. We also give a combinatorial characterization of the vertices of these polytopes lying on an arbitrary face, utilizing the more general class of twisted Bruhat orders.</description>

      <title>Average Nodal Count and the Nodal Count Condition for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nodal edge count of an eigenvector of the Laplacian of a graph is the number of edges on which it changes sign. This quantity extends to any real symmetric $n\times n$ matrix supported on a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. The average nodal count, averaged over all eigenvectors of a given matrix, is known to be bounded between $\frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)$, where $\beta(G)$ is the first Betti number of $G$ (a topological quantity), and it was believed that generically the average should be around $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)/2$. We prove that this is not the case: the average is bounded between $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)/n$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)-\beta(G)/n$, and we provide graphs and matrices that attain the upper and lower bounds for any possible choice of $n$ and $\beta$.
  A natural condition on a matrix for defining the nodal count is that it has simple eigenvalues and non-vanishing eigenvectors. For any connected graph $G$, a generic real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ satisfies this nodal count condition. However, the situation for constant diagonal matrices is far more subtle. We completely characterize the graphs $G$ for which this condition is generically true, and show that if this is not the case, then any real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ with constant diagonal has a multiple eigenvalue or an eigenvector that vanishes somewhere. Finally, we discuss what can be said when this nodal count condition fails, and provide examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combinatorially characterize the number $\mathrm{cc}_2$ of conjugacy classes of involutions in any Coxeter group in terms of higher rank odd graphs. This notion naturally generalizes the concept of odd graphs, used previously to count the number of conjugacy classes of reflections. We provide uniform bounds and discuss some extremal cases, where the number $\mathrm{cc}_2$ is smallest or largest possible. Moreover, we provide formulae for $\mathrm{cc}_2$ in free and direct products as well as for some finite and affine types, besides computing $\mathrm{cc}_2$ for all triangle groups, and all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank up to eleven.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue probability density function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble permits a $q$-extension related to the discrete $q$-Hermite weight and corresponding $q$-orthogonal polynomials. A combinatorial counting method is used to specify a positive sum formula for the spectral moments of this model. The leading two terms of the scaled $1/N^2$ genus-type expansion of the moments are evaluated explicitly in terms of the incomplete beta function. Knowledge of these functional forms allows for the smoothed leading eigenvalue density and its first correction to be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for graph reconstruction with maximal independent set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number of maximal independent set queries required to reconstruct the edges of a hidden graph. We show that randomised adaptive algorithms need at least $\Omega(\Delta^2 \log(n / \Delta) / \log \Delta)$ queries to reconstruct $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ with success probability at least $1/2$, and we further improve this lower bound to $\Omega(\Delta^2 \log(n / \Delta))$ for randomised non-adaptive algorithms. We also prove that deterministic non-adaptive algorithms require at least $\Omega(\Delta^3 \log n / \log \Delta)$ queries.
  This improves bounds of Konrad, O'Sullivan, and Traistaru, and answers one of their questions. The proof of the lower bound for deterministic non-adaptive algorithms relies on a connection to cover-free families, for which we also improve known bounds.</description>

      <title>Improved Total Domination and Total Roman Domination in Unit Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph with no isolated vertex. A set $D_t\subseteq V$ is a total dominating set of $G$ if $(i)$ $D_t$ is a dominating set, and $(ii)$ the set $D_t$ induces a subgraph with no isolated vertex. The total dominating set of minimum cardinality is called the minimum total dominating set, and the size of the minimum total dominating set is called the total domination number ($\gamma_t(G)$). Given a graph $G$, the total dominating set (TDS) problem is to find a total dominating set of minimum cardinality. A Roman dominating function (RDF) on a graph $G$ is a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that each vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $u\in V$ with $f(u)=2$. A RDF $f$ of a graph $G$ is said to be a total Roman dominating function (TRDF) if the induced subgraph of $V_1\cup V_2$ does not contain any isolated vertex, where $V_i=\{u\in V|f(u)=i\}$. Given a graph $G$, the total Roman dominating set (TRDS) problem is to minimize the weight, $W(f)=\sum_{u\in V} f(u)$, called the total Roman domination number ($\gamma_{tR}(G)$). In this paper, we are the first to show that the TRDS problem is NP-complete in unit disk graphs (UDGs). Furthermore, we propose a $7.17\operatorname{-}$ factor approximation algorithm for the TDS problem and a $6.03\operatorname{-}$ factor approximation algorithm for the TRDS problem in geometric unit disk graphs. The running time for both algorithms is notably bounded by $O(n\log{k})$, where $n$ represents the number of vertices in the given UDG and $k$ represents the size of the independent set in (i.e., $D$ and $V_2$ in TDS and TRDS problems, respectively) the given UDG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study arrangements of geodesic arcs on a sphere, where all arcs are internally disjoint and each arc has its endpoints located within the interior of other arcs. We establish fundamental results concerning the minimum number of arcs in such arrangements, depending on local geometric constraints such as "one-sidedness" and "k-orientation".
  En route to these results, we generalize and settle an open problem from CCCG 2022, proving that any such arrangement has at least two "clockwise swirls" and at least two "counterclockwise swirls".</description>

      <title>Connected Dominating Sets in Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex triangulation has a connected dominating set of size at most $10n/21$. Equivalently, every $n$ vertex triangulation has a spanning tree with at least $11n/21$ leaves. Prior to the current work, the best known bounds were $n/2$, which follows from work of Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson, and Thomassen (J. Graph Theory \textbf{14}(2):247--258). One immediate consequence of this result is an improved bound for the SEFENOMAP graph drawing problem of Angelini, Evans, Frati, and Gudmundsson (J. Graph Theory \textbf{82}(1):45--64). As a second application, we show that for every set $P$ of $\lceil 11n/21\rceil$ points in $\R^2$ every $n$-vertex planar graph has a one-bend non-crossing drawing in which some set of $11n/21$ vertices is drawn on the points of $P$. The main result extends to $n$-vertex triangulations of genus-$g$ surfaces, and implies that these have connected dominating sets of size at most $10n/21+O(\sqrt{gn})$.</description>

      <title>Mapping fiber, loop and suspension graphs in naive discrete homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete homotopy theory or A-homotopy theory is a combinatorial homotopy theory defined on graphs, simplicial complexes and metric spaces, reflecting information about their connectivity. The purpose of the present paper is to further understanding of the similarities between the A-homotopy and ordinary homotopy theories. More precisely, we define the notion of a mapping fiber in the category of graphs and study its basic properties, providing non-compatibility with projection.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative frieze patterns with coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on Berenstein and Retakh's notion of noncommutative polygons we introduce and study noncommutative frieze patterns. We generalize several notions and fundamental properties from the classic (commutative) frieze patterns to noncommutative frieze patterns, e.g. propagation formulae and $\mu$-matrices, quiddity cycles and reduction formulae, and we show that local noncommutative exchange relations and local triangle relations imply all noncommutative exchange relations and triangle relations. Throughout, we allow coefficients, so we obtain generalizations of results from our earlier paper on frieze patterns with coefficients from the commutative to the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric figure is a reptile if it can be dissected into at least two similar copies congruent to each other. We prove that if a trapezoid is a reptile and not a parallelogram, then the length of each base is a linear combination of the lengths of its legs with rational coefficients. We then rule out isosceles trapezoids and right trapezoids which are not reptile. In particular, we prove that, up to similarity, there are at most six reptile right trapezoids, not a parallelogram, whose acute internal angle is a rational multiple of $\pi$. Finally, we present a rep-25 right trapezoid that is not a parallelogram and is not similar to any of the known reptile trapezoids.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal Gr\"unbaum partition problem in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gr\"unbaum's equipartition problem asked if for any measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ there are always $d$ hyperplanes which divide $\mathbb{R}^d$ into $2^d$ $\mu$-equal parts. This problem is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 3$ and a negative one for $d\ge 5$. A variant of this question is to require the hyperplanes to be mutually orthogonal. This variant is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 2$ and there is reason to expect it to have a negative answer for $d\ge 3$. In this note we exhibit measures that prove this. Additionally, we describe an algorithm that checks if a set of $8n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be split evenly by $3$ mutually orthogonal planes. To our surprise, it seems the probability that a random set of $8$ points chosen uniformly and independently in the unit cube does not admit such a partition is less than $0.001$.</description>

      <title>Rays of the deformation cones of graphical zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a triangulation of certain faces of the submodular cone. More precisely, graphical zonotopes are generalized permutahedra, and hence are associated to faces of the submodular cone. We give a triangulation of these faces for graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 4 vertices. This grants us access to the rays of these faces: Minkowski indecomposable deformations of these graphical zonotopes are segments and triangles. Besides, computer experiments lead to examples of graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 5 vertices, whose graphical zonotopes have high dimensional Minkowski indecomposable deformations.</description>

      <title>Two variable logic with ultimately periodic counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the extension of two variable logic with quantifiers that state that the number of elements where a formula holds should belong to a given ultimately periodic set. We show that both satisfiability and finite satisfiability of the logic are decidable. We also show that the spectrum of any sentence is definable in Presburger arithmetic. In the process we present several refinements to the ``biregular graph method''. In this method, decidability issues concerning two-variable logics are reduced to questions about Presburger definability of integer vectors associated with partitioned graphs, where nodes in a partition satisfy certain constraints on their in- and out-degrees.</description>

      <title>Scattering Diagrams from Holomorphic Discs in Log Calabi-Yau Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.15234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct special Lagrangian fibrations for log Calabi-Yau surfaces, and scattering diagrams from Lagrangian Floer theory of the fibres. Then we prove that the scattering diagrams recover the scattering diagrams of Gross-Pandharipande-Siebert and the canonical scattering diagrams of Gross-Hacking-Keel. With an additional assumption on the non-negativity of boundary divisors, we compute the disc potentials of the Lagrangian torus fibres via a holomorphic/tropical correspondence. As an application, we provide a version of mirror symmetry for rank two cluster varieties.</description>

      <title>The complex genera, symmetric functions and multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the coefficients in front of Chern numbers for complex genera, and pay special attention to the $\text{Td}^{\frac{1}{2}}$-genus, the $\Gamma$-genus as well as the Todd genus. Some related geometric applications to hyper-K\"{a}hler and Calabi-Yau manifolds are discussed. Along this line and building on the work of Doubilet in 1970s, various Hoffman-type formulas for multiple-(star) zeta values and transition matrices among canonical bases of the ring of symmetric functions can be uniformly treated in a more general framework.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor methods for nonuniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multilinear algebra appears natural for studying the multiway interactions modeled by hypergraphs, tensor methods for general hypergraphs have been stymied by theoretical and practical barriers. A recently proposed adjacency tensor is applicable to nonuniform hypergraphs, but is prohibitively costly to form and analyze in practice. We develop tensor times same vector (TTSV) algorithms for this tensor which improve complexity from $O(n^r)$ to a low-degree polynomial in $r$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms. We also show these tensor measures offer complementary information to analogous graph-reduction approaches on data, and are also able to detect higher-order structure that many existing matrix-based approaches provably cannot.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the orbit space of a saturated fusion system after Steinberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Steinberg used discrete Morse theory to give a new proof of a theorem of Symonds that the orbit space of the poset of nontrivial $p$-subgroups of a finite group is contractible. We extend Steinberg's argument in two ways, covering more general versions of the theorem that were already known. In particular, following a strategy of Libman, we give a discrete Morse theoretic argument for the contractibility of the orbit space of a saturated fusion system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes are List Recoverable with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with random evaluation points are list recoverable up to capacity with optimal output list size, for any input list size.
  Namely, given an input list size $\ell$, a designated rate $R$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that a random RS code is list recoverable from $1-R-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with output list size $L = O(\ell/\varepsilon)$, for field size $q=\exp(\ell,1/\varepsilon) \cdot n^2$. In particular, this shows that random RS codes are list recoverable beyond the "list recovery Johnson bound". Such a result was not even known for arbitrary random linear codes. Our technique follows and extends the recent line of work on list decoding of random RS codes, specifically the works of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023), and of Guo and Zhang (FOCS 2023).</description>
