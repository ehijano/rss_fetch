      <title>On the Complexity of the Secret Protection Problem for Discrete-Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secret protection problem (SPP) seeks to synthesize a minimum-cost policy ensuring that every execution from an initial state to a secret state includes a sufficient number of protected events. Previous work showed that the problem is solvable in polynomial time under the assumptions that transitions are uniquely labeled and that the clearance level for every event is uniformly set to one. When these assumptions are relaxed, the problem was shown to be weakly NP-hard, leaving the complexity of the uniform variant open. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the uniform secret protection problem is NP-hard, even if all parameters are restricted to binary values. Moreover, we strengthen the existing results by showing that the general problem becomes NP-hard as soon as the uniqueness constraint on event labels is removed. We further propose a formulation of SPP as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of the ILP-based approach on relatively large systems. Finally, we examine a variant of SPP in which only distinct protected events contribute to clearance and show that its decision version is $\Sigma_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Symbolic Mealy Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose $\Lambda^*_M$-an active learning algorithm that learns symbolic Mealy automata, which support infinite input alphabets and multiple output characters. Each of these two features has been addressed separately in prior work. Combining these two features poses a challenge in learning the outputs corresponding to potentially infinite sets of input characters at each state. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of essential input characters, a finite set of input characters that is sufficient for learning the output function of a symbolic Mealy automaton. $\Lambda^*_M$ maintains an underapproximation of the essential input characters and refines this set during learning. We prove that $\Lambda^*_M$ terminates under certain assumptions. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds for the query complexity. Their similarity suggests the tightness of the bounds. We empirically demonstrate that $\Lambda^*_M$ is i) efficient regarding the number of queries on practical benchmarks and ii) scalable according to evaluations with randomly generated benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Characterization of deterministically recognizable weighted tree languages over commutative semifields by finitely generated and cancellative scalar algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the works of S. Bozapalidis and A. Alexandrakis, there is a well-known characterization of recognizable weighted tree languages over fields in terms of finite-dimensionality of syntactic vector spaces. Here we prove a characterization of bottom-up deterministically recognizable weighted tree languages over commutative semifields in terms of the requirement that the respective m-syntactic scalar algebras are finitely generated. The concept of scalar algebra is introduced in this paper; it is obtained from the concept of vector space by disregarding the addition of vectors. Moreover, we prove a minimization theorem for bottom-up-deterministic weighted tree automata and we construct the minimal automaton.</description>

      <title>Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</description>

      <title>Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata: Surjectivity, Reversibility and Cyclic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCAs), a variant of non-uniform cellular automata, which temporally use two rules in a sequence during their evolution. The one-dimensional t-NUCAs, under finite as well as infinite lattices, are considered in this work. Surjectivity and injectivity of the t-NUCAs are studied. The reversibility of the t-NUCAs is also explored here. Finally, a study on the cyclic behavior of finite t-NUCAs is presented.</description>

      <title>Learning Conservative Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms for such filters, however, suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we add to this set of approaches an algorithm for training neural control barrier functions from offline datasets. Such functions can be used to design constraints for quadratic programs that are then used as safety filters. Our algorithm trains these functions so that the system is not only prevented from reaching unsafe states but is also disincentivized from reaching out-of-distribution ones, at which they would be less reliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety while minimally affecting task performance.
