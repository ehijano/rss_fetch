      <title>A Different Demonstration for Integral Identity Across Distinct Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of time scales, given $\mathbb{T}$ a time scale with at least two distinct elements, an integration theory is developed using ideas already well known as Riemann sums. Another, more daring, approach is to treat an integration theory on this scale from the point of view of the Lebesgue integral, which generalizes the previous perspective. A great tool obtained when studying the integral of a scale $\mathbb{T}$ as a Lebesgue integral is the possibility of converting the ``$\Delta$-integral of $\mathbb{T}$'' to a classical integral of $\mathbb{R}$. In this way, we are able to migrate from a calculation that is sometimes not so intuitive to a more friendly calculation. A question that arises, then, is whether the same result can be obtained just using the ideas of integration via Riemann sums, without the need to develop the Lebesgue integral for $\mathbb{T}$. And, in this article, we answer this question affirmatively: In fact, for integrable functions an analogous result is valid by converting a $\Delta$-integral over $\mathbb{T}$ to a riemannian integral of $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Landesman-Lazer conditions for systems involving twist and positively homogeneous Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiplicity results for the periodic and Neumann-type boundary value problems associated with coupled Hamiltonian systems. For the periodic problem, we couple a system having twist condition with another one whose nonlinearity lies between the gradients of two positive and positively 2-homogeneous Hamiltonain functions. Concerning the Neumann-type problem, we treat the same system without any twist assumption. We examine the cases of nonresonance, simple resonance, and double resonance by imposing some kind of Landesman--Lazer conditions.</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear functional and integrodifferential Volterra convolution equations: Ces\`aro limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the requirements needed in order to characterise the solution space of perturbed linear integrodifferential Volterra convolution equations. We highlight how integrodifferential equations react far better under perturbations than their integral equation counterparts in regards to stability of solutions. To illustrate this idea we give a characterisation of when the Ces\`aro mean of solutions converge to a limit, which is explicitly identified and given in terms of the problem data. Additionally we note how all results can also be applied to functional differential equations.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier transform plays a central role in many geometric and combinatorial problems cast in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform are less structured, more `random', and can often be analysed more easily. In many cases obtaining good \emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good pointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a more nuanced approach where one seeks to bound the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform instead of only the maximum. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that a rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this new approach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance conjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set.</description>

      <title>Balayage of measures: behavior near a corner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the balayage of a measure $\mu$ defined on a domain $\Omega$ onto its boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assuming that $\Omega$ has a corner of opening $\pi \alpha$ at a point $z_0 \in \partial \Omega$ for some $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$ and that $d\mu(z) \asymp |z-z_{0}|^{2b-2}d^{2}z$ as $z\to z_0$ for some $b &gt; 0$, we obtain the precise rate of vanishing of the balayage of $\mu$ near $z_{0}$. The rate of vanishing is universal in the sense that it only depends on $\alpha$ and $b$. We also treat the case when the domain has multiple corners at the same point. Moreover, when $2b\leq \frac{1}{\alpha}$, we provide explicit constants for the upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>A phase-space approach to weighted Fourier extension inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to expose and investigate natural phase-space formulations of two longstanding problems in the restriction theory of the Fourier transform. These problems, often referred to as the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, assert that Fourier extension operators associated with rather general (codimension 1) submanifolds of euclidean space, may be effectively controlled by the classical X-ray transform via weighted $L^2$ inequalities. Our phase-space formulations, which have their origins in recent work of Dendrinos, Mustata and Vitturi, expose close connections with a conjecture of Flandrin from time-frequency analysis, and rest on the identification of an explicit "geometric" Wigner transform associated with an arbitrary (smooth strictly convex) submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main results are certain natural "Sobolev variants" of the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, and involve estimating the Sobolev norms of such Wigner transforms by geometric forms of classical bilinear fractional integrals. Our broad geometric framework allows us to explore the role of the curvature of the submanifold in these problems, and in particular we obtain bounds that are independent of any lower bound on the curvature; a feature that is uncommon in the wider restriction theory of the Fourier transform. Finally, we provide a further illustration of the effectiveness of our analysis by establishing a form of Flandrin's conjecture in the plane with an $\varepsilon$-loss. While our perspective comes primarily from euclidean harmonic analysis, the procedure used for constructing phase-space representations of extension operators is well-known in optics.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of an Extremal Function for the Delsarte Extremal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group $G$, the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions $f: G \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(0) = 1$ and having $\mathrm{supp} f_{+} \subset \Omega$ for some measurable subset $\Omega$ of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when $\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <title>Assouad spectrum of Gatzouras-Lalley carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine local scaling properties of a class of self-affine fractal sets called Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. More precisely, we establish a formula for the Assouad spectrum of all Gatzouras-Lalley carpets as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function combined with a simple parameter change. Our formula implies a number of novel properties for the Assouad spectrum not previously observed for dynamically invariant sets; in particular, the Assouad spectrum can be a non-trivial differentiable function on the entire domain $(0,1)$ and can be strictly concave on open intervals. Our proof introduces a general framework for covering arguments using techniques developed in the context of multifractal analysis, including the method of types from large deviations theory and Lagrange duality from optimisation theory.</description>
