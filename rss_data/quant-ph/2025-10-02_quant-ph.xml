      <title>Velocity effects slightly mitigating the quantumness degradation of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</description>

      <title>A robust phase of continuous transversal gates in quantum stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum error correcting code protects encoded logical information against errors. Transversal gates are a naturally fault-tolerant way to manipulate logical qubits but cannot be universal themselves. Protocols such as magic state distillation are needed to achieve universality via measurements and postselection. A phase is a region of parameter space with smoothly varying large-scale statistical properties except at its boundaries. Here, we find a phase of continuously tunable logical unitaries for the surface code implemented by transversal operations and decoding that is robust against dephasing errors. The logical unitaries in this phase have an infidelity that is exponentially suppressed in the code distance compared to their rotation angles. We exploit this to design a simple fault-tolerant protocol for continuous-angle logical rotations. This lowers the overhead for applications requiring many small-angle rotations such as quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Derandomised tensor product gap amplification for quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum PCP conjecture asks whether it is QMA-hard to distinguish between high- and low-energy Hamiltonians even when the gap between "high" and "low" energy is large (constant). A natural proof strategy is gap amplification: start from the fact that high- and low-energy Hamiltonians are hard to distinguish if the gap is small (inverse polynomial) and amplify the Hamiltonians to increase the energy gap while preserving hardness. Such a gap amplification procedure is at the heart of Dinur's proof of the classical PCP theorem. In this work, following Dinur's model, we introduce a new quantum gap amplification procedure for Hamiltonians which uses random walks on expander graphs to derandomise (subsample the terms of) the tensor product amplification of a Hamiltonian. Curiously, our analysis relies on a new technique inspired by quantum de Finetti theorems, which have previously been used to rule out certain approaches to the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization with Classical Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a powerful tool in solving various combinatorial problems such as Maximum Satisfiability and Maximum Cut. Hard computational problems, however, require deep circuits that place high demands on classical variational parameter optimization. Ultimately, this has necessitated investigations into alternative methods for effective QAOA parameterizations. Here, we study a parameterization scheme based on classical chaotic recursive mapping, which enables significant reductions in the scaling of the variational parameter space. Through numerical investigations of hard Maximum Satisfiability problems, we demonstrate that the chaotic mapping can effectively match the performance of standard QAOA when subject to a limited number of classical optimization iterations and short-depth circuits. Insight into this behavior is elucidated through the lens of classical dynamical systems and used to inform hybridized schemes that leverage both standard and chaotic parameterizations. It is shown that these hybridized approaches can boost QAOA performance beyond that of the standard approach alone, especially for deep circuits. Through this study, we provide a new perspective that introduces a generalized framework for specifying performant, dynamical-map-based QAOA parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Information Transmission Under a Continuous-Variable Erasure Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum capacity gives the fundamental limit of information transmission through a channel. However, evaluating the quantum capacities of a continuous-variable bosonic quantum channel, as well as finding an optimal code to achieve the optimal information transmission rate, is in general challenging. In this work, we derive the quantum capacity and entanglement-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic continuous-variable erasure channel when subject to energy constraints. We then construct random codes based on scrambling information within the typical subspace of the encoding state and prove that these codes are asymptotically optimal up to a constant gap. Finally, using our random coding scheme we design a bosonic variation of the Hayden-Preskill protocol and find that information recovery depends on the ratio between the input and output modes. This is in contrast with the conventional discrete-variable scenario which requires only a fixed number of additional output qudits.</description>

      <title>Isogeny Graphs in Superposition and Quantum Onion Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onion routing provides anonymity by layering encryption so that no relay can link sender to destination. A quantum analogue faces a core obstacle: layered quantum encryption generally requires symmetric encryption schemes, whereas classically one would rely on public-key encryption. We propose a symmetric-encryption-based quantum onion routing (QOR) scheme by instantiating each layer with the abelian ideal class group action from the Theory of Complex Multiplication. Session keys are established locally via a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between neighbors in the chain of communication. Furthermore, we propose a novel ''non-local'' key exchange between the sender and receiver. The underlying problem remains hard even for quantum adversaries and underpins the security of current post-quantum schemes. We connect our construction to isogeny graphs and their association schemes, using the Bose-Mesner algebra to formalize commutativity and guide implementation. We give two implementation paths: (i) a universal quantum oracle evaluating the class group action with polynomially many quantum resources, and (ii) an intrinsically quantum approach via continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs), outlined here and developed in a companion paper. A small Qiskit example illustrates the mechanics (by design, not the efficiency) of the QOR.</description>

      <title>Robust Rydberg facilitation via rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of a Cryogenic Vacuum Chamber for Ion Trapping Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a cryogenic vacuum chamber incorporating mechanical isolation from vibrations, a high numerical-aperture in-vacuum imaging objective, in-vacuum magnetic shielding, and an antenna for global radio-frequency manipulation of trapped ions. The cold shield near 4 K is mechanically referenced to an underlying optical table via thermally insulating supports and exhibits root-mean-square vibrations less than 7.61(4) nm. Using the in-vacuum objective, we can detect 397 nm photons from a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$ ion with 1.77% efficiency and achieve 99.9963(4)% single-shot state-detection fidelity in 50 $\mu$s. To characterize the efficacy of the magnetic shields, we perform Ramsey experiments on the ground state qubit and obtain a coherence time of 24(2) ms, which extends to 0.25(1) s with a single spin-echo pulse. XY4 and XY32 dynamical decoupling sequences driven via the radio-frequency antenna extend the coherence to 0.72(2) s and 0.81(3) s, respectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any quantum Hamiltonian with an inverse-polynomial gap, the ground state can be prepared in a polynomial circuit depth to inverse-polynomial precision, if the system size is sufficiently large. The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Directionality and quantum backfire in continuous-time quantum walks from delocalized states: Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3) an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase.</description>

      <title>Limitations of strong coupling in non-Markovian quantum thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01596</link>

Abstract: We investigate quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe embedded in a non-Markovian environment, employing the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) to overcome the limitations of Born-Markov approximations. Through a systematic analysis of the dynamical and steady-state behavior of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) for temperature estimation, we identify several key findings that challenge the conventional expectation that strong coupling necessarily enhances thermometric performance. In non-equilibrium dynamical thermometry, weak system-environment coupling generally yields the optimal QSNR, whereas in the steady-state regime, strong coupling enhances sensitivity only in the ultra-low-temperature limit, while weak coupling significantly improves precision at moderately low temperatures. To optimize performance across coupling regimes, we develop a hybrid computational framework that integrates HEOM with quantum-enhanced particle swarm optimization, enabling precise quantum dynamical control under varying coupling strengths. Our results reveal fundamental constraints and opportunities in quantum thermometry, offering practical strategies for the design of high-performance quantum thermometers operating in realistic open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample- and time-efficient algorithm to learn any bosonic Fock state acted upon by an arbitrary Gaussian unitary. As a special case, this algorithm efficiently learns states produced in Fock state BosonSampling, thus resolving an open question put forth by Aaronson and Grewal (Aaronson, Grewal 2023). We further study a hierarchy of classes of states beyond Gaussian states that are specified by a finite number of their higher moments. Using the higher moments, we find a full spectrum of invariants under Gaussian unitaries, thereby providing necessary conditions for two states to be related by an arbitrary (including active, e.g. beyond linear optics) Gaussian unitary.</description>

      <title>Entanglement distribution via satellite: an evaluation of competing protocols assuming realistic free-space optical channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key technical requirement of any future quantum network is the ability to distribute quantum-entangled resources between two spatially separated points at a high rate and high fidelity. Entanglement distribution protocols based on satellite platforms, which transmit and receive quantum resources directly via free-space optical propagation, are therefore excellent candidates for quantum networking, since the geometry and loss characteristics of satellite networks feasibly allow for up to continental-scale ($\sim10^3$ km) over-the-horizon communication without the infrastructure, cost, or losses associated with equivalent fibre-optic networks. In this work, we explore two network topologies commonly associated with quantum networks - entanglement distribution between two satellites in low-Earth orbit mediated by a third satellite and entanglement distribution between two ground stations mediated by a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and two entanglement distribution schemes - one where the central satellite is used as a relay, and the other where the central satellite is used to generate and distribute the entangled resource directly. We compute a bound on the rate of distribution of distillable entanglement achieved by each protocol in each network topology as a function of the network channels for both single-rail discrete- (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) resources and use or non-use of probabilistic noiseless linear quantum amplification (NLA). In the case of atmospheric channels we take into account the turbulent and optical properties of the free-space propagation. We determine that for the triple-satellite network configuration, the optimal strategy is to perform a distributed NLA scheme in either CV or DV, and for the ground-satellite-ground network the optimal strategy is to distribute a DV resource via the central satellite.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Advantage for Message Complexity in Distributed Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how much quantum distributed algorithms can outperform classical distributed algorithms with respect to the message complexity (the overall amount of communication used by the algorithm). Recently, Dufoulon, Magniez and Pandurangan (PODC 2025) have shown a polynomial quantum advantage for several tasks such as leader election and agreement. In this paper, we show an exponential quantum advantage for a fundamental task: routing information between two specified nodes of a network. We prove that for the family of ``welded trees" introduced in the seminal work by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003), there exists a quantum distributed algorithm that transfers messages from the entrance of the graph to the exit with message complexity exponentially smaller than any classical algorithm. Our quantum algorithm is based on the recent "succinct" implementation of quantum walks over the welded trees by Li, Li and Luo (SODA 2024). Our classical lower bound is obtained by ``lifting'' the lower bound from Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003) from query complexity to message complexity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Simulation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for electronic structure calculations of chemical systems. To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under these different parameter choices.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to extract the photon indistinguishability error from Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements, accounting for the combined effects of loss and multiphoton noise that contaminate the single-photon Hilbert space. Our analysis resolves apparent inconsistencies in previous interpretations of such measurements. The reported method applies to a wide range of single-photon sources, including quantum dots.</description>

Abstract: The most elementary non-Hermitian quantum square-well problem with real spectrum is considered. The Schroedinger equation is required discrete and endowed with PT-symmetric Robin (i.e., two-parametric) boundary conditions. Some of the rather enigmatic aspects of impact of the variability of the parameters on the emergence of the Kato's exceptional-point (EP) singularities is clarified. In particular, the current puzzle of the apparent absence of the EP degeneracies at the odd-matrix dimensions in certain simplified one-parametric cases is explained. A not quite expected existence of a multi-band spectral structure in another simplified one-parametric family of models is also revealed.</description>

      <title>Self-Sustained Oscillations of a Nonlinear Optomechanical System in the Low-Excitation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifesting across all time, mass and length scales, nonlinearities lie at the core of numerous physical phenomena. Next-generation quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, require the combination of nonlinearity with non-classical correlations. This necessitates the search for an experimental platform which enables a nonlinear response at ultra-low excitation levels in a system with practical sensing potential and quantum compatibility. Here, we report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes.</description>

Abstract: We explore the interplay between two emerging paradigms: reservoir computing and quantum computing. We observe how quantum systems featuring beyond-classical correlations and vast computational spaces can serve as non-trivial, experimentally viable reservoirs for typical tasks in machine learning. With a focus on neutral atom quantum processing units, we describe and exemplify a novel quantum reservoir computing (QRC) workflow. We conclude exploratively discussing the main challenges ahead, whilst arguing how QRC can offer a natural candidate to push forward reservoir computing applications.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid biphoton spectrometer for time-resolved quantum spectroscopy across visible and near-infrared regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning plays a crucial role in exploring hypothetical scenarios, by comparing some consequent under conditions identical except as results from a differing antecedent. David Lewis' well-known analysis evaluates counterfactuals using a hierarchy of desiderata. These were, however, built upon a deterministic classical framework, and whether it could be generalized to indeterministic quantum theory has been an open question. In this Letter, we propose a formalism for quantum counterfactuals in which antecedents are measurement settings. Unlike other approaches, it non-trivially answers questions like: "Given that my photon-detector, observing an atom's fluorescence, clicked at a certain time, what would I have seen using a field-quadrature detector instead?"</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steric clashes pose a challenge when exploring dense protein systems using conventional explicit-chain methods. A minimal example is a single lattice protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems. It can be recast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem amenable to classical and quantum approaches. We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure enumeration, at a high computational cost.</description>

      <title>Temporal Pulse Origins in Atom Interferometric Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based upon atom interferometry typically rely on radio-frequency or optical pulses to coherently manipulate atomic states and make precise measurements of inertial and gravitational effects. An advantage of these sensors over their classical counterparts is often said to be that their measurement scale factor is precisely known and highly stable. However, in practice the finite pulse duration makes the sensor scale factor dependent upon the pulse shape and sensitive to variations in control field intensity, frequency, and atomic velocity. Here, we explore the concept of a temporal pulse origin in atom interferometry, where the inertial phase response of any pulse can be parameterized using a single point in time. We show that the temporal origin permits a simple determination of the measurement scale factor and its stability against environmental perturbations. Moreover, the temporal origin can be treated as a tunable parameter in the design of tailored sequences of shaped pulses to enhance scale factor stability and minimize systematic errors. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach to pulse design can reduce overall sequence durations while increasing robustness to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude. Our results show that the temporal pulse origin explains a broad class of systematic errors in existing devices and enables the design of short, robust pulses which we expect will improve the performance of current and next-generation interferometric quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks for Graph Representation Learning in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has emerged as a cornerstone technique for analysing complex, networked data across diverse domains, including biological systems, social networks, and data analysis. Traditional GRL methods often struggle to capture intricate relationships within complex graphs, particularly those exhibiting non-trivial structural properties such as power-law distributions or hierarchical structures. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for GRL, utilizing hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks to overcome these limitations. Our approach combines the benefits of both quantum and classical dynamics, allowing the walker to simultaneously explore both highly local and far-reaching connections within the graph. Preliminary results for a case study in network community detection shows that this hybrid dynamic enables the algorithm to adapt effectively to complex graph topologies, offering a robust and versatile solution for GRL tasks.</description>

      <title>The Constant Speed Schedule for Adiabatic State Preparation: Towards Quadratic Speedup without Prior Spectral Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of adiabatic quantum evolution is governed by the adiabatic evolution time, \(T\), which depends on the minimum energy gap, \(\Delta\). For a generic schedule, \(T\) typically scales as \(\Delta^{-2}\), whereas the rigorous lower bound is \(\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-1})\). This indicates the potential for a quadratic speedup through the adiabatic schedule construction. Here, we introduce the constant speed schedule, which traverses the adiabatic path of the eigenstate at a uniform rate. We first show that this approach reduces the scaling of the upper bound of the required evolution time by one order in \(1/\Delta\). We then provide a segmented constant speed schedule protocol, in which path segment lengths are computed from eigenstate overlaps along the adiabatic evolution. By relying on the overlaps on the fly, our method eliminates the need for prior spectral knowledge. We test our algorithm numerically on the adiabatic unstructured search, the N$_2$ molecule, and the [2Fe-2S] cluster. In our numerical experiments, the method achieves the optimal \(1/\Delta\) scaling in a small gap region, thereby demonstrating a quadratic speedup over the standard linear schedule.</description>

      <title>Maximum heralding probabilities of non-classical state generation from two-mode Gaussian state via photon counting measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly non-classical states of light - such as the approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states or cat-like states - can be generated from experimentally accessible Gaussian states via photon counting measurements on selected modes, conditioned on specific outcomes of these heralding events. A simplest yet important example of this approach involves performing photon number measurements on one mode of a two-mode entangled Gaussian state. The heralding probability of this scheme is a key figure of merit, as it determines the generation rate of the targeted non-classical state. In this work we show that the maximum heralding probability for the two-mode setting can be calculated analytically, and we investigate its dependence on the number of detected photons n. Our results show that the number of required experimental trials scales only polynomially with n. Generation of highly complex optical quantum states with high stellar rank is thus practically feasible in this setting, given access to sufficiently strong squeezing.</description>

      <title>Formal Framework for Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by notions of quantum heuristics and by average-case rather than worst-case algorithmic analysis, we define quantum computational advantage in terms of individual problem instances. Inspired by the classical notions of Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity, we define their quantum versions. This allows us to define queasy instances of computational problems, like e.g. Satisfiability and Factoring, as those whose quantum instance complexity is significantly smaller than their classical instance complexity. These instances indicate quantum advantage: they are easy to solve on a quantum computer, but classical algorithms struggle (they feel queasy). Via a reduction from Factoring, we prove the existence of queasy Satisfiability instances; specifically, these instances are maximally queasy (under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions). Further, we show that there is exponential algorithmic utility in the queasiness of a quantum algorithm. This formal framework serves as a beacon that guides the hunt for quantum advantage in practice, and moreover, because its focus lies on single instances, it can lead to new ways of designing quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</description>

      <title>HIV-1 protease cleavage sites detection with a Quantum convolutional neural network algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)-based framework with the neural quantum embedding (NQE) to predict HIV-1 protease cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from viral and human proteins. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of our framework, we compared the classification performance against classical neural networks under both noiseless and noisy simulations. Among experimental conditions, the QCNN with the angle and amplitude encoding NQE conditions consistently outperformed classical counterparts in both the similar trainable parameter scale and the different number of qubits (the averaged performance of the 4-qubits and 8-qubits QCNN: 0.9146 and 0.8929 / the averaged performance of the classical neural network: 0.6125 and 0.8278). The QCNN with the NQE showed stable performance under the quantum hardware noise, confirming its applicability to biomedical data analysis with the noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. This study presents the first application of NQE-augmented QCNNs for HIV-1 cleavage site classification, providing new insights into scalable and noise-resilient quantum machine learning for biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Fiber-integrated NV Magnetometer with Microcontroller-based Software Lock-in Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-integrated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometers possess high sensitivity, integration, and flexibility, and thus have been explored extensively for industrial applications. While most studies have focused on the optimization of the quantum sensing head, less attention has been paid to the frequently employed professional, expensive, and bulky electronics, which hinder their practical applications. In this article, we fabricate a fiber-integrated NV magnetometer and develop a low-cost microcontroller-based software lock-in technique. In this technique, a microcontroller coordinates efficiently a microwave source chip and an analog-to-digital converter, and a program mimicking the lock-in mechanism realizes microwave frequency-modulated optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. As a result, with our setup and technique, we have realized the detection of weak magnetic field with a sensitivity of 93 nT/Hz^{1/2}, which is comparable to what obtained with bulky and professional devices. Furthermore, we demonstrated real-time magnetic field detection, achieving a standard deviation of 488 nT. Our work provides a novel and cost-effective technique for electronic miniaturization, thereby potentially accelerating the industrial application of NV magnetometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many computationally hard problems can be encoded in quantum Hamiltonians. The solution to these problems is given by the ground states of these Hamiltonians. A state-of-the-art algorithm for finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian is the so-called Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) which approximates imaginary time evolution by a unitary evolution that can be implemented in quantum hardware. In this paper, we review the original algorithm together with a comprehensive computer program, as well as, the variational version of it.</description>

      <title>Critical Quantum Sensing: a tutorial on parameter estimation near quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is \emph{critical quantum metrology} -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system and dissipative regimes, and outline both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have introduced the worst-case quantum divergence as a key measure in quantum information. Here we show that such divergences can be understood from the perspective of the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability, which utilizes the asymmetric distinguishability between a pair of quantum states as resource. In our work, we extend this framework to settings with partial information, where the goal is to distinguish between sets of quantum states rather than individual states. Within this setting, we characterize optimal rates for resource distillation and dilution using (smoothed) one-shot divergences and regularized divergences. Our framework further exhibits a reversibility property: resource interconversions can be achieved without loss at rates determined entirely by regularized divergences. These results offer a broad operational interpretation of divergences between state sets and generalize existing resource theories to encompass incomplete information scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing fermionic Hamiltonians with classical interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimization problem (ground energy search) for fermionic Hamiltonians with classical interactions. This QMA-hard problem is motivated by the Coulomb electron-electron interaction being diagonal in the position basis, a fundamental fact that underpins electronic-structure Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We prove that fermionic Gaussian states achieve an approximation ratio of at least 1/3 for such Hamiltonians, independent of sparsity. This shows that classical interactions are sufficient to prevent the vanishing Gaussian approximation ratio observed in SYK-type models. We also give efficient semi-definite programming algorithms for Gaussian approximations to several families of traceless and positive-semidefinite classically interacting Hamiltonians, with the ability to enforce a fixed particle number. The technical core of our results is the concept of a Gaussian blend, a construction for Gaussian states via mixtures of covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Realism and the Inequivalence of the Two Quantum Pictures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard claim that the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics are equivalent rests on the fact that they yield identical empirical predictions. This equivalence therefore assumes the instrumentalist worldview in which theories serve only as tools for prediction. Under scientific realism, by contrast, theories aim to describe reality. Whereas the Schr\"odinger picture posits a time-evolving wave function, the Heisenberg picture posits so-called descriptors, time-evolving generators of the algebra of observables. These two structures are non-isomorphic: descriptors surject onto but do not reduce to the Schr\"odinger state. Hence, under realism, the pictures are inequivalent. I argue that this inequivalence marks an opening toward a richer, separable ontology for quantum theory. On explanatory grounds, descriptors provide genuinely local accounts of superdense coding, teleportation, branching, and Bell inequality violations -- phenomena that the Schr\"odinger framework does not explain fully locally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for most part of the last century. This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations.</description>

      <title>A quantum analogue of convex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex optimization is the powerhouse behind the theory and practice of optimization. We introduce a quantum analogue of unconstrained convex optimization: computing the minimum eigenvalue of a Schr\"odinger operator $h = -\Delta + V $ with convex potential $V:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ such that $V(x)\rightarrow\infty $ as $\|x\|\rightarrow\infty$. For this problem, we present an efficient quantum algorithm, called the Fundamental Gap Algorithm (FGA), that computes the minimum eigenvalue of $h$ up to error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time in $n$, $1/\epsilon$, and parameters that depend on $V$. Adiabatic evolution of the ground state is used as a key subroutine, which we analyze with novel techniques that allow us to focus on the low-energy space. We apply the FGA to give the first known polynomial-time algorithm for finding the lowest frequency of an $n$-dimensional convex drum, or mathematically, the minimum eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an $n$-dimensional region that is defined by $m$ linear constraints in polynomial time in $n$, $m$, $1/\epsilon$ and the radius $R$ of a ball encompassing the region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to much-studied quantum circuits, and is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrices from R\'enyi relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\'eel-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Builds for Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that establish an independently verifiable path from source code to binary artifacts, helping to detect and mitigate certain classes of supply chain attacks. Although quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of research, it can already benefit from adopting reproducible builds. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the quantum computing and reproducible builds communities. We propose a generalization of the definition of reproducible builds in the quantum setting, motivated by two threat models: one targeting the confidentiality of end users' data during circuit preparation and submission to a quantum computer, and another compromising the integrity of quantum computation results. This work presents three examples that show how classical information can be hidden in transpiled quantum circuits, and two cases illustrating how even minimal modifications to these circuits can lead to incorrect quantum computation results. Our work provides initial steps towards a framework for reproducibility in quantum software toolchains.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the complexity of preparing mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the correlations in a many-qubit mixed state and the minimum circuit depth needed for its preparation. If the mutual information between two subsystems exceeds the mutual information between one of those subsystems and the environment, which purifies the mixed state of the system, then the past lightcones of the subsystems must intersect one another. This results in a lower bound on the circuit depth of any ensemble of geometrically local unitaries that prepares the state to some specified degree of approximation. As an application, we derive lower bounds on the circuit depth needed to prepare thermal states of one-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory, showing that the depth diverges as temperature is decreased up to a cutoff set by the preparation error.</description>

      <title>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spacings in the superposed spectra of random matrices with comparison to spacing ratios and application to complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between random matrices and the spectral fluctuations of complex quantum systems in a suitable limit can be explained by using the setup of random matrix theory. Higher-order spacing statistics in the $m$ superposed spectra of circular random matrices are studied numerically. We tabulated the modified Dyson index $\beta'$ for a given $m$, $k$, and $\beta$, for which the nearest neighbor spacing distribution is the same as that of the $k$-th order spacing distribution corresponding to the $\beta$ and $m$. Here, we conjecture that for given $m(k)$ and $\beta$, the obtained sequence of $\beta'$ as a function of $k(m)$ is unique. This result can be used as a tool for the characterization of the system and to determine the symmetry structure of the system without desymmetrization of the spectra. We verify the results of the $m=2$ case of COE with the quantum kicked top model corresponding to various Hilbert space dimensions. From the comparative study of the higher-order spacings and ratios in both $m=1$ and $m=2$ cases of COE and GOE by varying dimension, keeping the number of realizations constant and vice-versa, we find that both COE and GOE have the same asymptotic behavior in terms of a given higher-order statistics. But, we found from our numerical study that within a given ensemble of COE or GOE, the results of spacings and ratios agree with each other only up to some lower $k$, and beyond that, they start deviating from each other. It is observed that for the $k=1$ case, the convergence towards the Poisson distribution is faster in the case of ratios than the corresponding spacings as we increase $m$ for a given $\beta$. Further, the spectral fluctuations of the intermediate map of various dimensions are studied. There, we find that the effect of random numbers used to generate the matrix corresponding to the map is reflected in the higher-order statistics.</description>

Abstract: The effective deployment and application of advanced methodologies for quantum chemistry is inherently linked to the optimal usage of emerging and highly diversified computational resources. This paper examines the synergistic utilization of Micron memory technologies and Azure Quantum Element cloud computing in Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations leveraging coupled-cluster (CC) downfolded/effective Hamiltonians based on the double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) Ansatz. We analyze the performance of the DMRG-DUCC workflow, emphasizing the proper choice of hardware that reflects the numerical overheads associated with specific components of the workflow. We report a hybrid approach that takes advantage of Micron CXL hardware for the memory capacity intensive CC downfolding phase while employing AQE cloud computing for the less resource-intensive DMRG simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the scalable ExaChem suite of electronic simulations conducted on Micron prototype systems.</description>

      <title>BIFROST: A First-Principles Model of Polarization Mode Dispersion in Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BIFROST, a first-principles model of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers. Unlike conventional models, BIFROST employs physically motivated representations of the PMD properties of fibers, allowing users to computationally investigate real-world fibers in ways that are connected to physical parameters such as environmental temperature and external stresses. Our model, implemented in an open-source Python module, incorporates birefringence from core geometry, material properties, environmental stress, and fiber spinning. We validate our model by examining commercial fiber specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more applications across fiber technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping supersymmetric (matrix) quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and (zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim \kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the coefficient $\kappa &gt; .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point $g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g = \sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations, and discuss possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Emission of pairs of Minkowski photons through the lens of the Unruh effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic and non-additive interactions of a Rydberg impurity in a quantum bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the Fr\"ohlich paradigm.</description>

      <title>Classification of Thouless pumps with non-invertible symmetries and implications for Floquet phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry preserving adiabatic and Floquet dynamics of one-dimensional systems. Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a correspondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by spatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of gapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are classified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then explicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with $\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless pump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump operators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used to construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram characterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an Onsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between distinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge \hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices in [10].</description>

      <title>Tunable Wigner Molecules in a Germanium Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.</description>

      <title>Background Suppression in Quantum Sensing of Dark Matter via $W$ State Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors' state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors' decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in nonlinear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of \emph{topological} Hall-effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear optical process via spatial symmetry-breaking in pseudo-spin textures created by a spatially-structured pump laser beam. The experimental configuration consists of a moderately-focused pump laser beam undergoing a parametric interaction with an organic solvent (toluene) and an off-resonant laser beam probes the non-trivial spatial magnetization textures created by the pump beam. The phase-profile of the transmitted probe beam is extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms for ascertaining the topological charge which is shown to be consistent with the estimation of Berry's curvature that we obtain via paraxial approximation-based modeling of third-order nonlinear interaction.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation from CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots in in-situ selected Laguerre-Gaussian modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: We study dissipative effects for a system consisting of a massless real scalar field satisfying Neumann boundary conditions on a space and time-dependent surface, in d+1 dimensions. We focus on the comparison of the results for this system with the ones corresponding to Dirichlet conditions, and the same surface space-time geometry. We show that, in d=1, the effects are equal up to second order for rather arbitrary surfaces, and up to fourth order for wavelike surfaces. For d&gt;1, we find general expressions for their difference.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots (DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal ones.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a unitary quantum cellular automaton (QCA) that, in the continuum limit, converges to the (1+1)-dimensional Generalized Dirac Equation (GDE). We outline the construction of the unitary, discrete-time evolution and derive the model's exact dispersion relation from its eigenvalue spectrum, showing it possesses the correct relativistic limit. We then explore its dynamics through numerical simulations. While the total probability density is shown to be insensitive to the chiral angle parameter $(\rho)$ of the GDE, we demonstrate that this parameter has a profound and directly observable effect on the particle's local spin polarization. By measuring this quantity, we reveal the hidden internal dynamics of the spinor, providing a clear, visual confirmation of the physical consequences of the chiral mass term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, a trade off of sharing of entanglement between subsystems of a higher dimensional quantum state is derived. It is presented in terms of an inequality which is analogous to the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality that succinctly describes monogamy of entanglement in $\mathcal{C}^2\otimes \mathcal{C}^2\otimes \mathcal{C}^2$ dimensional pure state. To derive the monogamy inequality in $\mathcal{C}^d\otimes \mathcal{C}^d\otimes \mathcal{C}^d$ dimension, G-concurrence measure of entanglement is considered as a measure of entanglement of maximal dimension. The approach of the present paper incidentally points towards a rigorous framework which enables us to obtain an upper bound of G-concurrence of a bipartite qudit mixed state. Obtained upper bound of G-concurrence is then shown to satisfy a monogamy relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05450v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the ancient Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox to the recent Sorkin-type impossible measurements problem, the contradictions between relativistic causality, quantum non-locality, and quantum measurement have persisted. Based on quantum field theory, our work provides a framework that harmoniously integrates these three aspects. This framework consists of causality expressed by reduced density matrices and an interpretation of quantum mechanics that considers quantum mechanics to be complete.
  Specifically, we use reduced density matrices to represent the local information of the quantum state and show that the reduced density matrices cannot evolve superluminally.
  Unlike recent approaches that address causality by introducing new operators to represent detectors, our perspective is that everything--including detectors, the environment, and even humans--is made up of the same fundamental fields. This viewpoint leads us to question the validity of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and motivates us to propose an interpretation of quantum mechanics that requires no extra assumptions and remains fully compatible with relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the implementation of high-fidelity, phonon-mediated gate operations and quantum simulation schemes for spin qubits associated with silicon vacancy centers in diamond. Specifically, we show how the application of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques can substantially boost the coherence of the qubit states while increasing at the same time the variety of effective spin models that can be implemented in this way. Based on realistic models and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this decoupling technique can suppress gate errors by more than two orders of magnitude and enable gate infidelities below $\sim 10^{-4}$ for experimentally relevant noise parameters. Therefore, when generalized to phononic lattices with arrays of implanted defect centers, this approach offers a realistic path toward moderate- and large-scale quantum devices with spins and phonons, at a level of control that is competitive with other leading quantum-technology platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research has been dedicated to the asymptotic theory of quantum metrology, where the goal is to determine the ultimate precision limit of quantum channel estimation when many accesses to the channel are allowed. The ultimate limit has been well established, but in general a noiseless and controllable ancilla is required for attaining it. Little is known about the metrological performance without noiseless ancillae, which is more relevant in practical circumstances. In this Letter, we present a novel theoretical framework to address this problem, bridging quantum metrology and the asymptotic theory of quantum channels. Leveraging this framework, we prove sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated applications of the channel to be estimated, both with and without applying interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an algorithm to identify the control operation explicitly.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can qualitatively mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Effective eigenvalue approximation from moments for self-adjoint trace-class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions. Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it approximates the spectrum well without diagonalization.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$ tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.
  Numerical examples demonstrate the relevance of our approximation in estimating entropy and negativity, which is useful, among others, in quantum optical and in open quantum system models. The results can be directly applicable to problems in quantum information, statistical mechanics, and quantum thermodynamics, where using traditional techniques based on diagonalization is impractical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterising large-scale quantum systems is central to fundamental physics and essential for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterisation requires exponentially increasing resources, focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly simplified analysis. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits of this approach remain elusive. We present protocols for overlapping tomography that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. First, by providing algorithmic approaches based on graph theory we find the minimal number of Pauli settings, relating overlapping tomography to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics. This significantly reduces the number of measurement settings, showing for instance that two-body overlapping tomography of nearest neighbours in qubit systems with planar topologies can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we prove that using general projective measurements, all $k$-body marginals can be reconstructed with only $3^k$ settings, independently of the system size. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in a six-photon experiment. Our results will find applications in learning noise and interaction patterns in quantum computers as well as characterising fermionic systems in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Multimode Phonon-Polaritons in Lead-Halide Perovskites in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime</title>

Abstract: Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: Tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is a fundamental primitive of fault-tolerant quantum computing. But in order for error correction to proceed, one must first prepare the codespace of the underlying error-correcting code. A popular method for encoding quantum low-density parity-check codes is transversal initialization, where one begins in a product state and measures a set of stabilizer generators. In the presence of measurement errors however, this procedure is generically not fault-tolerant, and so one typically needs to repeat the measurements many times, resulting in a deep initialization circuit. We present a protocol that prepares the codespace of constant-rate hypergraph product codes in constant depth with $O(\sqrt{n})$ spatial overhead, and we show that the protocol is robust even in the presence of measurement errors. Our construction is inspired by dimension-jumping in topological codes and leverages two properties that arise from the homological product of codes. We provide some improvements to lower the spatial overhead and discuss applications to fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to address a specific aspect of the Quantum Marginal Problem: reconstructing a global density matrix compatible with a given set of quantum marginals. Our method integrates a quantum marginal imposition technique with convolutional denoising autoencoders. The loss function is carefully designed to enforce essential physical constraints, including Hermiticity, positivity, and normalization. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high success rates and accuracy. Furthermore, we show that, in many cases, our model offers a faster alternative to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers without compromising solution quality. These results highlight the potential of machine learning techniques for solving complex problems in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study relaxations of entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding and establish that non-signaling assistance and a natural semi-definite programming relaxation\, -- \,termed meta-converse\, -- \,are equivalent in terms of success probabilities. We then present a rounding procedure that transforms any non-signaling-assisted strategy into an entanglement-assisted one and prove an approximation ratio of $(1 - e^{-1})$ in success probabilities for the special case of measurement channels. For fully quantum channels, we give a weaker (dimension dependent) approximation ratio, that is nevertheless still tight to characterize the strong converse exponent of entanglement-assisted channel coding [Li and Yao, IEEE Tran.~Inf.~Theory (2024)]. Our derivations leverage ideas from position-based coding, quantum decoupling theorems, the matrix Chernoff inequality, and input flattening techniques.</description>

      <title>Intensity correlations in decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbour correlations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction for large-scale electronic structure calculations with a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is an approach for quantum chemical calculations using current quantum computers. In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM Quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.18\% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1\% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for dealing with symmetries in quantum systems and which define the gauge theory analog of encodings. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRF setups within the perspective-neutral framework for gauge systems. Concepts from QECCs like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from error-generated QRF degrees of freedom. Relative to this split, errors corrupt only redundant frame data, leading to a novel characterization of correctability. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors behave as electric excitations that are dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. This gives rise to a new class of correctable errors and a systematic error duality. We illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. Our exploratory investigations pave the way for foundational applications to gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to nonchaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of nonchaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale eigenvalue problems pose a significant challenge to classical computers. While there are efficient quantum algorithms for unitary or Hermitian matrices, eigenvalue problems for non-normal matrices remain open in quantum computing. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm that given a non-normal matrix, outputs an estimate of an eigenvalue to within additive error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $1-p_{\rm fail}$. Our estimation strategy is to sample points on the complex plane and examine the distance between the sampled point and the eigenvalues. We show that the distance is related to the smallest singular value of the shifted matrix, hence reducing the problem to ground state energy estimation via Hermitianization. With the knowledge of an eigenvalue, we are able to prepare the associated eigenvector using ground state preparation. Our estimating scheme can also be modified to approximate the extreme eigenvalue, and in particular the spectral gap. The algorithm is implemented based on the block encoding input model and requires $O(\kappa^2\epsilon^{-(2m-1)}\log(1/p_{\rm fail}))$ queries to the block encoding oracle. Our algorithm is the first general eigenvalue algorithm that achieves this scaling. We also perform numerical simulation to validate the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Succinct Perfect Zero-knowledge for MIP*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their recent breakthrough result, Slofstra and the second author show that there is a two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE (STOC'24). We build on their result to show that there exists a succinct two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE against dishonest verifiers with polylog question size and O(1) answer size, or with O(1) question size and polylog answer size. To prove our result, we study the three central compression techniques underlying the MIP*=RE proof (Ji et al. '20): question reduction, oracularization, and answer reduction. We show that question reduction preserves the perfect (as well as statistical and computational) zero-knowledge properties of the original protocol against dishonest verifiers, and oracularization and answer reduction preserve the perfect (as well as statistical and computational) zero-knowledge properties of the original protocol against honest verifiers. Secondly, we show that every constraint-constraint binary constraint system (BCS) nonlocal game, which provides a quantum information characterization of MIP*, can be converted to a synchronous constraint-variable BCS game to preserve perfect completeness for our compression. Lastly, we present a parametrized perfect-zero-knowledge transformation of MIP* protocols, which generalizes the transformation in (Slofstra and Kieran STOC'24) . This transformation allows us to preserve the zero-knowledge property against dishonest verifiers in the recursively oracularized protocols in our compression.</description>

      <title>On Speedups for Convex Optimization via Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential for quantum speedups in convex optimization using discrete simulations of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) framework, as proposed by Leng et al., and establish the first rigorous query complexity bounds. We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\"odinger operators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing explicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These bounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our findings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In continuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve arbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely from the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical dynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz convex function can be optimized to an error of $\epsilon$ with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under reasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation, $\widetilde{\Omega}(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Thus, QHD does not offer a speedup over classical zeroth order methods with exact oracles. However, we demonstrate that the QHD algorithm tolerates $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^3/d^{1.5}G^2 R^2)$ noise in function evaluation. We show that QHD offers a super-quadratic query advantage over all known classical algorithms tolerating this level of evaluation noise in the high-dimension regime. Additionally, we design a quantum algorithm for stochastic convex optimization that provides a super-quadratic speedup over all known classical algorithms in the high-dimension regime. To our knowledge, these results represent the first rigorous quantum speedups for convex optimization achieved through a dynamical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Overhead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</description>

      <title>Dynamical decoupling of interacting spins through group factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a well-known open-loop protocol for suppressing unwanted interactions in a quantum system, thereby drastically extending the coherence time of useful quantum states. In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales, using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR, including the classical Lee-Goldburg protocol, and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Noise-adaptive Transpilation in Quantum Computing: How Much Impact Does it Have?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transpilation, particularly noise-aware optimization, is widely regarded as essential for maximizing the performance of quantum circuits on superconducting quantum computers. The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16 diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights: (1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing fidelity -- offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the noiseless case, in contrast to the dynamics of entanglement in anisotropic XY chains, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. In contrast, when noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change qualitatively: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with the time scale of a ramp quench, with an exponent determined by the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Reasoning with Control as a Constructor, Applications to Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control is a predominant concept in quantum and reversible computational models. It allows to apply or not a transformation on a system, depending on the state of another system. We introduce a general framework for diagrammatic reasoning featuring control as a constructor. To do so, we provide an elementary axiomatisation of control functors, extending the standard formalism of props (symmetric monoidal categories with the natural numbers as objects) to controlled props. As an application, we show that controlled props ease diagrammatic reasoning for quantum circuits by allowing a simple complete set of relations that only involves relations acting on at most three qubits, whereas it is known that in the standard prop setting any complete axiomatisation requires relations acting on arbitrarily many qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for Uhlmann transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem is a central result in quantum information theory, associating the closeness of two quantum states with that of their purifications. This theorem well characterizes the fundamental task of transforming a quantum state into another state via local operations on its subsystem. The optimal transformation for this task is called the Uhlmann transformation, which has broad applications in various fields; however, its quantum circuit implementation and computational cost have remained unclear. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing quantum query and sample algorithms that realize the Uhlmann transformation in the form of quantum circuits. As part of our approach, we employ a quantum sample algorithm that performs the so-called canonical purification when necessary. These Uhlmann transformation algorithms achieve exponential improvements in computational costs, including query and sample complexities, over naive approaches based on state measurements such as quantum state tomography, under certain computational models. We apply our algorithms to the square root fidelity estimation task and particularly show that our approach attains a better query complexity than the prior state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we discuss applications to several information-theoretic tasks, specifically, entanglement transmission, quantum state merging, and algorithmic implementation of the Petz recovery map, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the computational costs.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Recovery via Direct Sum Formalism Without Measurement Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a new approach to quantum state recovery following measurement. Specifically, we introduce a special operation that transfers the probability amplitude of the quantum state into its orthogonal complement. This operation is followed by a measurement performed on this orthogonal subspace, enabling the undisturbed original quantum state to be regained. Remarkably, this recovery is achieved without dependence of the post-measurement operation on the measurement outcome, thus allowing the recovery without historical dependence. This constitutes a highly nontrivial phenomenon. From the operational perspective, as the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and probabilistic cloning of arbitrary quantum states, and traditional post-measurement reversal methods typically rely on operations contingent on the measurement outcomes, it questions fundamental assumptions regarding the necessity of historic dependence. From an informational perspective, since this recovery method erases the information about the measurement outcome, it's intriguing that the information can be erased without accessing the measurement outcome. These results imply the operational and informational non-triviality formulated in a direct-sum Hilbert space framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using extensive numerical analysis of 20,000 randomly generated two-qubit states, we provide a quantitative analysis of the connection between entanglement measures and Maximized Quantum Fisher Information (MQFI). Our systematic study shows strong empirical relationships between the metrological capacity of quantum states and three different entanglement measures: concurrence, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. We show that optimization over local unitary transformations produces substantially more predictable relationships than fixed-generator quantum Fisher information approaches using sophisticated statistical analysis, such as bootstrap resampling, systematic data binning, and multiple model comparisons. With exponential fits reaching $R^2 &gt; 0.99$ and polynomial models reaching $R^2 = 0.999$, we offer thorough empirical support for saturation behavior in quantum metrological advantage. With immediate applications to realworld quantum sensing protocols, our findings directly empirically validate important predictions from quantum resource theory and set fundamental bounds for quantum sensor optimization and resource allocation. These intricate relationships are quantitatively described by the polynomial and exponential fit equations, which offer crucial real-world direction for the design of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Learning Hamiltonians from Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Hamiltonians from time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-iHt}$ for an unknown Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover the parameters of $H$. This is a well-studied problem in quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing, device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning to error $\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \epsilon$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to be $k$-local, we show that learning to constant error requires $n^{\Omega (k)}$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Tang. These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where the goal is to detect the presence of a single coefficient which is super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian, as well as for average case instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <title>Encoder Circuit Optimization for Non-Binary Quantum Error Correction Codes in Prime Dimensions: An Algorithmic Framework</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers are a revolutionary class of computational platforms with applications in combinatorial and global optimization, machine learning, and other domains involving computationally hard problems. While these machines typically operate on qubits, which are quantum information elements that can occupy superpositions of the basis states 0 and 1, recent advances have demonstrated the practical implementation of higher-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) across various hardware platforms. In these hardware realizations, the higher-order states are less stable and thus remain coherent for a shorter duration than the basis 0 and 1 states. Moreover, formal methods for designing efficient encoder circuits for these systems remain underexplored. This limitation motivates the development of efficient circuit techniques for qudit systems (d-level quantum systems). Previous works have typically established generating gate sets for higher-dimensional codes by generalizing the methods used for qubits. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework for optimizing encoder circuits for prime-dimension stabilizer codes. This framework is based on novel generating gate sets whose elements map directly to efficient Clifford gate sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on key codes, achieving a 13-44 percent reduction in encoder circuit gate count for the qutrit (d = 3) codes [[9,5,3]], [[5,1,3]], and [[7,1,3]], and a 9-21 percent reduction for the ququint (d = 5) code [[10,6,3]] when compared to prior work. We also achieved circuit depth reductions up to 42 percent.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum State Preparation with Tree-Based Bayesian Optimization Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximate state preparation on near-term quantum computers, where the goal is to construct a parameterized circuit that reproduces the output distribution of a target quantum state while minimizing resource overhead. This task is especially relevant for near-term algorithms where distributional matching suffices, but it is challenging due to stochastic outputs, limited circuit depth, and a high-dimensional, non-smooth parameter space. We propose CircuitTree, a surrogate-guided optimization framework based on Bayesian Optimization with tree-based models, which avoids the scalability and smoothness assumptions of Gaussian Process surrogates. Our framework introduces a structured layerwise decomposition strategy that partitions parameters into blocks aligned with variational circuit architecture, enabling distributed and sample-efficient optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and variational tasks validate our theoretical insights, showing that CircuitTree achieves low total variation distance and high fidelity while requiring significantly shallower circuits than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A hypersphere-like non-Abelian Yang monopole and its topological characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic monopoles, which correspond to degeneracies of Hamiltonians, play a central role in understanding exotic topological phenomena. Dissipation-induced non-Herminicity (NH), extending the eigenspectra of Hamiltonians from the real to complex domain, largely enriches the topological physics associated with synthetic monopoles. We here investigate exceptional points (EPs) in a four-dimensional NH system, finding a hypersphere-like non-Abelian Yang monopole in a five-dimensional parameter space, formed by EP2 pairs. Such an exotic structure enables the NH Yang monopole to exhibit a unique topological transition, which is inaccessible with the point-like counterpart. We characterize such a topological phenomenon with the second Chern number.</description>

      <title>Two-level adiabatic transition probability for small avoided crossings generated by tangential intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <title>Emergent multi-loop nested point gap in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</description>

      <title>Photonic crystal cavities based on suspended yttrium iron garnet nanobeams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the $R$-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bootstrap program is presented for algebraically solving the $R$-matrix of a generic integrable quantum spin chain from its Hamiltonian. The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test. However in all known examples they all turn out to be satisfied whenever the lowest order condition is. It remains to be understood whether they are all implied by the Reshetikhin condition.</description>

      <title>Recovering Einstein's equation from local correlations with quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An observable spacetime can be viewed as a "continuum" of worldline coincidences (events) between a particle system and the observers of an ideal extended reference frame (RF). When this frame is absent, the metric encodes the infinitesimal proper intervals between those events that the ideal RF would assign if it were present. Extending this idea to the quantum domain -- where events arise from interactions that generate correlations -- we propose that, within a small spacelike region, the metric encodes local correlations with a quantum RF, thereby dispensing with its physical presence. This framework yields the full nonlinear Einstein equation in two scenarios: either recovering the maximal vacuum entanglement hypothesis in the first-order limit of state perturbations or producing a reference spacetime whose scalar curvature equals the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</description>
