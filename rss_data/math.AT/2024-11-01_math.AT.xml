      <description>arXiv:2410.23520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enumerate complex rank $n$ topological vector bundles on $\mathbb CP^{n+1}$ with prescribed Chern classes. This extends work of Atiyah and Rees in the case $n=2$ and work of Hu in the case that all Chern classes are zero.</description>

      <title>The Tangle Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an $(\infty,1)$-category ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the morphisms in which are framed tangles in $\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{D}^1$. We prove that ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ has the universal mapping out property of the 1-dimensional Tangle Hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Hopkins--Lurie: it is the rigid $\mathcal{E}_n$-monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category freely generated by a single object. Applying this theorem to a dualizable object of a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category gives link invariants, generalizing the Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants.</description>

      <title>Derived Stone Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result, the Stone embedding, characterizes profinite sets as totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff spaces. Building on "Pyknotic objects, I. Basic notions", which introduced a derived Stone embedding of the pro-category of $\pi$-finite spaces into pyknotic spaces, this thesis uses the $\infty$-topoi machinery to partially characterize the essential image of this embedding, extending the classical characterization to the derived setting.</description>

      <title>The Atiyah-Sutcliffe conjecture and $E_n$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a certain conjecture by Atiyah and Sutcliffe implies the existence of an E3-algebra (respectively E2-algebra) structure on the disjoint union of all complex (respectively real) full flag manifolds modulo symmetric groups. Moreover, we show that these structures are liftings of exotic E3 (respectively E2) structures on the free infinite loop spaces on BU(1)+ (respectively BO(1)+), that do not extend to E4 (respectively E3) structures. We also provide some (co=homological calculations supporting the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The mod p cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group at large primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the cohomology of the extended Morava stabilizer group of height $n$, with trivial mod $p$ coefficients, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p&gt;&gt;n$. The result is an exterior algebra on $n$ generators. A brief sketch of the method: we introduce a family of deformations of Ravenel's Lie algebra model $L(n,n)$ for the Morava stabilizer group scheme. This yields a family of DGAs, parameterized over an affine line and smooth except at a single point. The singular fiber is the Chevalley-Eilenberg DGA of Ravenel's Lie algebra. Consequently the cohomology of the singular fiber is the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group, at large primes. We prove a derived version of the invariant cycles theorem from Hodge theory, which allows us to compare the cohomology of the singular fiber to the fixed-points of the Picard-Lefschetz (monodromy) operator on the cohomology of a smooth fiber. Finally, we use some new methods for constructing small models for cohomology of reductive Lie algebras to show that the cohomology of the Picard-Lefschetz fixed-points on a smooth fiber agrees with the singular cohomology $H^*(U(n);\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the unitary group, which is the desired exterior algebra.</description>

      <title>Modular vector fields in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a non-commutative analogue of the modular vector field on a Poisson manifold for a given pair of a double bracket and a connection on a space of 1-forms. As an application, we give an algebraic description of the framed, groupoid version of Turaev's loop operation $\mu$ similar to the one obtained by Alekseev--Kawazumi--Kuno--Naef and the author. The key ingredient for the modular vector field, the triple divergence map, is directly constructed from a connection on a linear category to deal with multiple base points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1956 Hirzebruch found an explicit formula for the denominators of the Todd polynomials, which was proved later in his joint work with Atiyah. We present a new formula for the Todd polynomials in terms of the ``forgotten symmetric functions", which follows from our previous work on complex cobordisms. In particular, this leads to a simpler proof of the Hirzebruch formula and provides new interpretations for the Hirzebruch numbers.</description>

      <title>Model structures for diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets admit a notion of internal equivalence in the sense of coinductive weak invertibility, with similar properties to its analogue in strict $\omega$-categories. We construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are diagrammatic sets in which every round pasting diagram is equivalent to a single cell -- its weak composite -- and propose them as a model of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories. For each $n &lt; \infty$, we then construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are those $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; n$ are all weakly invertible. We show that weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely morphisms that are essentially surjective on cells of all dimensions. On the way to this result, we also construct model structures for $(\infty, n)$-categories on marked diagrammatic sets, which split into a coinductive and an inductive case when $n = \infty$, and prove that they are Quillen equivalent to the unmarked model structures when $n &lt; \infty$ and in the coinductive case of $n = \infty$. Finally, we prove that the $(\infty, 0)$-model structure is Quillen equivalent to the classical model structure on simplicial sets. This establishes the first proof of the homotopy hypothesis for a model of $\infty$-groupoids defined as $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; 0$ are all weakly invertible.</description>

      <title>Derived $q$-Hodge complexes and refined $\operatorname{TC}^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a consequence of Efimov's proof of rigidity of the $\infty$-category of localising motives, Scholze and Efimov have constructed refinements of localising invariants such as $\operatorname{TC}^-$. In this article we compute the homotopy groups of the refined invariants $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{ku})$ and $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{KU})$. The computation involves a surprising connection to $q$-de Rham cohomology. In particular, it suggests a construction of a $q$-Hodge filtration on $q$-de Rham complexes in certain situations, which can be used to construct a functorial derived $q$-Hodge complex for many rings. This is in contrast to a no-go result by the second author, who showed that such a $q$-Hodge complex (and thus also a $q$-Hodge filtration) cannot exist in full generality.</description>

Abstract: We build a unified framework for the study of monodromy operators and weight filtrations of cohomology theories for varieties over a local field. As an application, we give a streamlined definition of Hyodo-Kato cohomology without recourse to log-geometry, as predicted by Fontaine, and we produce an induced Clemens-Schmid chain complex.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for High-dimensional Data Based on Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for analyzing the topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the k-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.</description>

      <title>Dominance complexes, neighborhood complexes and combinatorial Alexander duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the dominance complex $\mathcal{D}(G)$ of a graph $G$ coincides with the combinatorial Alexander dual of the neighborhood complex $\mathcal{N}(\overline{G})$ of the complement of $G$. Using this, we obtain a relation between the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ and the homology group of $\mathcal{D}(G)$. We also obtain several known results related to dominance complexes from well-known facts of neighborhood complexes. After that, we suggest a new method for computing the homology groups of the dominance complexes, using independence complexes of simple graphs. We show that several known computations of homology groups of dominance complexes can be reduced to known computations of independence complexes. Finally, we determine the homology group of $\mathcal{D}(P_n \times P_3)$ by determining the homotopy types of the independence complex of $P_n \times P_3 \times P_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the epimorphisms in homotopy type theory (HoTT) as the fiberwise acyclic maps and develop a type-theoretic treatment of acyclic maps and types in the context of synthetic homotopy theory as developed in univalent foundations. We present examples and applications in group theory, such as the acyclicity of the Higman group, through the identification of groups with 0-connected, pointed 1-types. Many of our results are formalized as part of the agda-unimath library.</description>
