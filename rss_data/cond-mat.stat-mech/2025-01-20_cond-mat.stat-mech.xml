      <title>Hydrodynamic Equations for a system with translational and rotational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for many-particle systems whose microscopic units have both translational and rotational motion. The orientational dynamics of each element are studied in terms of the rotational Brownian motion of a corresponding fixed-length director ${\bf u}$. The time evolution of a set of collective densities $\{\hat{\psi}\}$ is obtained as an exact representation of the corresponding microscopic dynamics. For the Smoluchowski dynamics, noise in the Langevin equation for the director ${\bf u}$ is multiplicative. We obtain that the equation of motion for the collective number-density has two different forms, respectively, for the I\"{t}o and Stratonvich interpretation of the multiplicative noise in the ${\bf u}$-equation. Without the ${\bf u}$ variable, both reduce to the Standard Dean-Kawasaki form. Next, we average the microscopic equations for the collective densities $\{\hat{\psi}\}$ (which are, at this stage, a collection of Dirac delta functions) over phase space variables and obtain a corresponding set of stochastic partial differential equations for the coarse-grained densities $\{\psi\}$ with smooth spatial and temporal dependence. The coarse-grained equations of motion for the collective densities $\{\psi\}$ constitute the fluctuating non-linear hydrodynamics for the fluid with both rotational and translational dynamics. From the stationary solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, we obtain a free energy functional ${\cal F}[\psi]$ and demonstrate the relation between the ${\cal F}[\psi]$s for different levels of the FNH descriptions with its corresponding set of $\{\psi\}$.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model along critical relaxational flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model, and in particular the critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches to the critical point, driven by purely relaxational (single-spin-flip Metropolis) upgradings of the link ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge variables. We monitor the critical relaxational dynamics by computing the energy density, which is the simplest local gauge-invariant quantity that can be measured in a lattice gauge theory. The critical relaxational flow of the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model is analyzed within an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling framework, which allows us to compute the dynamic critical exponent $z$ associated with the purely relaxational dynamics of the three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge universality class. We obtain $z=2.610(15)$, which significantly improves earlier results obtained by other methods, in particular those obtained by analyzing the equilibrium critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of transitions between quantum nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a transition between nonequilibrium steady states, the entropic cost associated with the maintenance of steady-state currents can be distinguished from that arising from the transition itself through the concepts of excess/housekeeping entropy flux and adiabatic/nonadiabatic entropy production. The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes.</description>

      <title>Generation of entanglement and non-stationary states via competing coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent non-stationary behavior.</description>

      <title>Motorized Chromosome Models of Mitosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During mitosis, near-spherical chromosomes reconfigure into rod-like structures to ensure their accurate segregation to daughter cells. We explore here, the interplay between the nonequilibrium activity of molecular motors in determining the chromosomal organization in mitosis and its characteristic symmetry-breaking events. We present a hybrid motorized chromosome model that highlights the distinct roles of condensin I and II in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Guided by experimental observations, the simulations suggest that condensin II facilitates large-scale scaffold formation, while condensin I is paramount in local helical loop arrangement. Together, these two distinct grappling motors establish the hierarchical helical structure characteristic of mitotic chromosomes, which exhibit striking local and, sometimes global, chirality and contribute to the robust mechanical properties of mitotic chromosomes. Accompanying the emergence of rigidity, the model provides mechanisms of forming defects, including perversions and entanglements, and shows how these may be partially resolved through condensin activity and topoisomerase action. This framework bridges coarse-grained energy landscape models of chromosome dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, advancing the understanding of chromosome organization during cell division and beyond.</description>

      <title>Irreversible swap algorithms for soft sphere glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend to soft repulsive interaction potentials a recently proposed irreversible swap algorithm originally designed for polydisperse hard spheres. The original algorithm performs rejection-free, irreversible, collective swap moves. We show that event-driven cluster updates of particle diameters can also be performed in continuous potentials by introducing a factorised Metropolis probability. However, the Metropolis factorisation needed to deal with continuous potentials decreases the efficiency of the algorithm and mitigates the benefits of breaking detailed balance. This leads us to propose another irreversible swap algorithm using the standard Metropolis probability that accelerates the relaxation of soft sphere glasses at low temperatures, compared to the original swap algorithm. We apply these efficient swap algorithms to produce very stable inherent structures with vibrational density of states lacking the quasi-localised excitations observed in conventional glasses.</description>

      <title>Topological-to-Topological Transition Induced by On-Site Nonlinearity in a One-Dimensional Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the notion of band topology to nonlinear systems by defining nonlinear counterparts of eigenvalue problems. They have found the nonlinearity-induced topological transition, while it has required complicated nonlinearity such as off-diagonal one. Thus, the existence of nonlinearity-induced transitions has been unclear under homogeneous on-site nonlinearity, which is ubiquitously found in nature. We here reveal that such on-site nonlinearity can induce transitions of topological modes, where topological modes converging to zero begin to converge to nonzero values. Since such nonlinearity-induced transition remains the bulk band topology unchanged, we can regard it as a transition from a conventional topological mode to one unique to nonlinear systems. We analyze a nonlinear eigenvalue problem by rewriting it to a dynamical system in the spatial direction and clarify that the nonlinearity-induced transition is a result of the bifurcation in the spatial dynamics. We also propose a possible setup to observe the nonlinearity-induced transition that uses a gradual amplification of nonlinear waves. These results provide a general designing principle of topological insulators controlled by nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Mosaic-skeleton approximation is all you need for Smoluchowski equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a surprising way of exploitation of the mosaic--skeleton approximations for efficient numerical solving of aggregation equations with many applied kinetic kernels. The complexity of the evaluation of the right-hand side with $M$ nonlinear differential equations basing on the use of the mosaic-skeleton approximations is $\mathcal{O}(M \log^2 M)$ operations instead of $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$ for the straightforward computation. The class of kernels allowing to make fast and accurate computations via our approach is wider than analogous set of kinetic coefficients for effective calculations with previously developed algorithms. This class covers the aggregation problems arising in modelling of sedimentation, supersonic effects, turbulent flows, etc. We show that our approach makes it possible to study the systems with $M=2^{20}$ nonlinear equations within a modest computing time.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces in various fields of sciences. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization methods impose limitations on the interpretation and reproducibility of the resulting plots. Here, we propose using principal component analysis (PCA) for projecting hypercubes, which offers an automated, interpretable, and reproducible solution. We reveal analytically and numerically that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions in the state space. The resulting distribution of projected vertices is shown to be asymptotically the standard Gaussian, a characteristic of high-dimensional orthogonal projections. This method is applied to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, where the biplots reveal the pathways involving correlated spin flips. Our work demonstrates the potential of PCA for discovering hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To learn such models from data, a common approach involves decomposing the SDE into a linear combination of basis functions. However, this can induce overfitting due to the proliferation of parameters. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method that removes superfluous parameters from SDE models by combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory. We benchmark it against existing methods and show that it reliably selects the exact minimal models from large libraries of functions, even with a low sampling rate or measurement error. We show that it extends to stochastic partial differential equations and demonstrate applications to the inference of ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Truncated Wigner Approximation for Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) enables us to investigate bosonic quantum many-body dynamics, including open quantum systems described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In the TWA, the Weyl-Wigner transformation, a way of mapping from quantum-mechanical operators to $c$-numbers, of the GKSL equation leads to the Fokker-Planck equation, which we calculate by reducing it to the corresponding stochastic differential equations. However, the Fokker-Planck equation is not always reduced to the stochastic differential equations depending on details of jump operators. In this work, we clarify the condition for obtaining the stochastic differential equations from the Fokker-Planck equation and derive analytical expressions of these equations for a system with an arbitrary Hamiltonian with jump operators that do not couple different states. This result enables us to shortcut the conventional complicated calculations in applying the TWA. In the course of the derivation, we formulate the GKSL equation by using the path-integral representation based on the Weyl-Wigner transformation, which gives us a clear interpretation of the relation between the TWA and quantum fluctuations and allows us to calculate the non-equal time correlation functions in the TWA. In the benchmark calculations, we numerically confirm that the relaxation dynamics of physical quantities including the non-equal time correlation functions obtained in our formulation agrees well with the exact ones in the numerically solvable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy increase is fundamentally related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. By adding the 'extra dimension' associated with thermodynamic forces, we extend that discrete symmetry to a continuous symmetry for the dynamical fluctuations around (nonlinear) gradient flow. The latter connects macroscopic equilibrium conditions upon introducing a quasistatic protocol of control parameters. The entropy state function becomes the Noether charge. As a result, and following ideas expressed by Shin-ichi Sasa and co-workers, the adiabatic invariance of the entropy, part of the Clausius heat theorem, gets connected with the Noether theorem.</description>

      <title>A toy model solved by statistical mechanics for teaching reaction kinetics beyond ideality</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical equilibrium is fully characterized by thermodynamics, while the rates of chemical reactions can be calculated for ideal solutions by using mass-action equations. The evaluation of the rates of reactions in a non-ideal system is instead much more complex, even at equilibrium, being dependent on the microscopic features of the interactions: no universal theory exist. Here we propose a toy model to help students understand such complexity. It is formulated by means of statistical mechanics and aims at the evaluation of the exchange reaction rate at equilibrium. The toy model can be solved by the students, with various types of interactions, as an exercise. The results prove that no general rule connects the reaction rates to the thermodynamic quantities, such as the activity coefficients, dramatically proving the complexity and richness of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-field theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models is developed by considering the Fredrickson-Andersen model on the Bethe lattice. Using certain properties of the dynamics observed in actual numerical experiments we derive asymptotic dynamical equations equal to those of Mode-Coupling-Theory. Analytical predictions obtained for the dynamical exponents are successfully compared with numerical simulations in a wide range of models, including the case of generic values of the connectivity and the facilitation, random pinning and fluctuating facilitation. The theory is thus validated for both continuous and discontinuous transitions and also in the case of higher order critical points characterized by logarithmic decays.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions induced by quantum-data collection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entanglement transition in an array of qubits, induced by the transfer of quantum information from a system to a quantum computer. This quantum-data collection is an essential protocol in quantum machine learning algorithms that promise exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. In this and an accompanying work [Phys. Rev. A 111, 012425 (2025)], we identify sufficient conditions for an entanglement transition to occur in the late time state of the system and quantum computer. In this letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a 1D chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction $p$ of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate $p$ is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries</title>

Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00197</link>

Abstract: Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization: theory and experimentation</title>

Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Correlations, Spectra and Entanglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we analyze the spectra of the MPS transfer matrices and relate them to the spreading of mutual information in the MPS state. We demonstrate how different features of the spectral density correspond to distinct types of circuits, revealing that these MPS ensembles retain crucial physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. Notably, in the presence of quantum monitoring, we show the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.</description>
