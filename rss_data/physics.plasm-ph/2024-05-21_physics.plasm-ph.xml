      <title>Progress in Electron Energy Modeling for Hypersonic Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the electron energy relaxation terms is presented here, which is applicable to high-speed plasma flows and discharges wherein the electron temperature could be higher or lower than the gas temperature. It is demonstrated that the electron energy losses due to inelastic collisions can be expressed as a function of only two species-dependent parameters: the reduced electric field and the reduced electron mobility. This formulation is advantageous over previous ones, being simpler to implement and more accurate when experimental data of the reduced electric field and reduced mobility are available. Curve fits to empirical data of these two properties are outlined here for all important air molecular species. The approach accounts for all inelastic electron energy relaxation processes without needing individual cross-sections or rates, reducing potential errors associated with independently handling each process. Several test cases are presented to validate the proposed electron energy source terms including hypersonic plasma flows for which the electron temperature is less than the gas temperature, as well as discharges in which the electron temperature reaches values in excess of 30 eV. In all cases, the agreement with experimental data is observed to be very good to excellent, significantly surpassing prior electron energy models for high-speed flows.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the ELM-free Negative Triangularity Edge on DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokamak plasmas with strong negative triangularity (NT) shaping typically exhibit fundamentally different edge behavior than conventional L-mode or H-mode plasmas. Over the entire DIII-D database, plasmas with sufficiently negative triangularity are found to be inherently free of edge localized modes (ELMs), even at injected powers well above the predicted L-H power threshold. A critical triangularly ($\delta_\mathrm{crit}\simeq-0.15$), consistent with inherently ELM-free operation is identified, beyond which access to the second stability region for infinite-$n$ ballooning modes closes on DIII-D. It is also possible to close access to this region, and thereby prevent an H-mode transition, at weaker average triangularities ($\delta\lesssim\delta_\mathrm{crit}$) provided that at least one of the two x-points is still sufficiently negative. Enhanced low field side magnetic fluctuations during ELM-free operation are consistent with additional turbulence limiting the NT edge gradient. Despite the reduced upper limit on the pressure gradient imposed by ballooning stability, NT plasmas are able to support small pedestals and are typically characterized by an enhancement of edge pressure gradients beyond those found in traditional L-mode plasmas. Further, the pressure gradient inside of this small pedestal is unusually steep, allowing access to high core performance that is competitive with other ELM-free regimes previously achieved on DIII-D. Since ELM-free operation in NT is linked directly to the magnetic geometry, NT fusion pilot plants are predicted to maintain advantageous edge conditions even in burning plasma regimes, potentially eliminating reactor core-integration issues caused by ELMs.</description>

      <title>Compact Spin-Polarized Positron Acceleration in Multi-Layer Microhole Array Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact spin-polarized positron accelerators play a major role in promoting significant positron application research, which typically require high acceleration gradients and polarization degree, both of which, however, are still great challenging. Here, we put forward a novel spin-polarized positron acceleration method which employs an ultrarelativistic high-density electron beam passing through any hole of multi-layer microhole array films to excite strong electrostatic and transition radiation fields. Positrons in the polarized electron-positron pair plasma, filled in the front of the multi-layer films, can be captured, accelerated, and focused by the electrostatic and transition radiation fields, while maintaining high polarization of above 90% and high acceleration gradient of about TeV/m. Multi-layer design allows for capturing more positrons and achieving cascade acceleration. Our method offers a promising solution for accelerator miniaturization, positron injection, and polarization maintaining, and also can be used to accelerate other charged particles.</description>

      <title>Real-time equilibrium reconstruction by neural network based on HL-3 tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural network model, EFITNN, has been developed capable of real-time magnetic equilibrium reconstruction based on HL-3 tokamak magnetic measurement signals. The model processes inputs from 68 channels of magnetic measurement data gathered from 1159 HL-3 experimental discharges, including plasma current, loop voltage, and the poloidal magnetic fields measured by equilibrium probes. The outputs of the model feature eight key plasma parameters, alongside high-resolution ($129\times129$) reconstructions of the toroidal current density $J_{\text P}$ and poloidal magnetic flux profiles $\Psi_{rz}$. Moreover, the network's architecture employs a multi-task learning structure, which enables the sharing of weights and mutual correction among different outputs, and lead to increase the model's accuracy by up to 32%. The performance of EFITNN demonstrates remarkable consistency with the offline EFIT, achieving average $R^2 = 0.941, 0.997$ and $0.959$ for eight plasma parameters, $\Psi_{rz}$ and $J_{\text P}$, respectively. The model's robust generalization capabilities are particularly evident in its successful predictions of quasi-snowflake (QSF) divertor configurations and its adept handling of data from shot numbers or plasma current intervals not previously encountered during training. Compared to numerical methods, EFITNN significantly enhances computational efficiency with average computation time ranging from 0.08ms to 0.45ms, indicating its potential utility in real-time isoflux control and plasma profile management.</description>

      <title>Collisional damping of wave modes in ion-electron plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To expand on recent work, we introduce collisional terms in the analysis of the warm ion-electron, two-fluid equations for a homogeneous plasma at rest. Consequently, the plasma is now described by six variables: the magnetisation, the ratio of masses over charges, the electron and ion sound speeds, the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field, and a new parameter describing the electron-ion collision frequency. This additional parameter does not introduce new wave modes compared to the collisionless case, but does result in complex mode frequencies. Both for the backward and forward propagating modes the imaginary components are negative and thus quantify collisional damping. We provide convenient (polynomial) expressions to quantify frequencies and damping rates in all short and long wavelength limits, including the cut-off and resonance limits, whilst the one-fluid magnetohydrodynamic limit is retained with the familiar undamped slow, Alfv\'en and fast (SAF) waves. As collisions only introduce a damping, the previously introduced labelling of the wave modes S, A, F, M, O and X can be kept and assigned based on their long and short wavelength behaviour. The obtained damping at cut-off and resonance limits is parametrised with the collision frequency, and can be tailored to match known kinetic damping expressions. It is demonstrated that varying the angle can introduce crossings between the wave modes, as was already present in the ideal ion-electron case, but also a collision frequency exceeding a critical collision frequency can lead to crossings at angles where previously only avoided crossings were found.</description>

      <title>Plasma water treatment for PFAS: Study of degradation of perfluorinated substances and their byproducts by using cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure (NTP APPJ) for treating PFAS - contaminated water in different matrices. Successful removal of several perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C6 to C4), perfluroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (C8 to C4) and perfluropolyethers (PFPEs) (GenX and ADONA) PFAS compounds was achieved in laboratory scale experiments. Complex matrix effects influence degradation rates. Byproducts from the plasma treatment were investigated, revealing distinct degradation mechanisms for various PFAS compounds. For PFSAs and PFCAs, degradation involved electron transfer, bond breaking and subsequent reactions. Conversely, ADONA and GenX degradation initiated with ether-group cleavage, followed by additional transformation processes. Plasmabased technology shows potential for degradation of PFAS, especially for newer substitute compounds like ADONA and GenX. However, further research is needed to optimize plasma performance for complete mineralization of PFAS. This study also proposes a degradation mechanism for ADONA, marking a novel investigation into ether-group PFAS degradation with potential implications for further research and understanding toxicological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex gas is an approximation used to study 2D flow using statistical mechanics methodologies. We investigate low positive Onsager temperature states for the vortex gas on an annular domain. Using mean field theory, microcanonical sampling of the point gas model, and canonical sampling of a lattice model, we find evidence for edge modes at low energy states.</description>

      <title>Dust-ion-acoustic damped solitary waves and shocks in laboratory and Saturn's E-ring magnetized nonthermal dusty plasmas with anisotropic ion pressure and dust-charge fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the oblique propagation of weakly nonlinear dust-ion-acoustic (DIA) solitary waves (SWs) and shocks in collisional magnetized nonthermal dusty plasmas that are relevant in laboratory and space (Saturn's E-ring) environments. We consider plasmas to be composed of $q$-nonextensive hot electrons, thermal positive ions, and immobile negatively charged dust grains immersed in a static magnetic field and take into account the effects of ion creation (source), and ion loss (sink), ion-neutral and ion-dust collisions, anisotropic ion pressure and dust-charge fluctuations on the evolution of small-amplitude SWs and shocks. The ion-neutral collision enhancement equilibrium dust-charge number is self-consistently determined using Newton's Raphson method. We found that in laboratory dusty plasmas with adiabatic dust-charge variation [i.e., when the dust charging frequency ($\nu_{\rm{ch}}$) is much higher than the dust-plasma oscillation frequency ($\omega_{\rm{pd}}$)], the DIA solitary waves (DIASWs) get damped by the effects of the ion-dust and ion-neutral collisions, whereas the ion creation and ion loss leads to the amplification of solitary waves, and they appear as only compressive types with positive potential. On the other hand, in Saturn's E-ring plasmas, where the collisional and ion creation or ion loss effects are insignificant, the non-adiabaticity of dust-charge variation can give rise to the evolution of either damped DIASWs or DIA shocks, depending on the smallness of the ratios $\nu_{\rm{ch}}/\omega_{\rm{pd}}$ or $\omega_{\rm{pd}}/\nu_{\rm{ch}}$, respectively. Furthermore, two critical values of the nonextensive parameter $q$ exist, below (or above) which, the DIASWs and shocks can appear as rarefactive (or compressive) types. The characteristics of DIASWs and shocks are also analyzed numerically for parameters relevant to the laboratory and Saturn's E-ring plasmas.</description>

      <title>Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Reduced Order Modeling of Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering complex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.</description>

      <title>Electron root optimisation for stellarator reactor designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method of optimising stellarator devices to favour the presence of an electron root solution of the radial electric field. Such a solution can help avoid heavy impurity accumulation, improve neoclassical thermal ion confinement and helium ash exhaust and possibly reduce turbulence. This study shows that an optimisation for such a root is possible in quasi-isodynamic stellarators. Examples are shown for both vacuum and finite plasma pressure configurations.</description>

      <title>On the importance of parallel magnetic-field fluctuations for electromagnetic instabilities in STEP</title>

Abstract: [ABRIDGED] This paper discusses the importance of parallel perturbations of the magnetic-field in gyrokinetic simulations of electromagnetic instabilities and turbulence at mid-radius in the burning plasma phase of the conceptual high-$\beta$, reactor-scale, tight-aspect-ratio tokamak STEP. Previous studies have revealed the presence of unstable hybrid kinetic ballooning modes (hKBMs) at binormal scales approaching the ion Larmor radius. In this STEP plasma it was found that the hKBM requires the inclusion of parallel magnetic-field perturbations to be linearly unstable. Here, the extent to which the inclusion of fluctuations in the parallel magnetic-field can be relaxed is explored through gyrokinetic simulations. In particular, the frequently used MHD approximation (dropping $\delta \! B_{\parallel}$ and setting the $\nabla B$ drift frequency equal to the curvature drift frequency) is discussed and simulations explore whether this approximation is useful for modelling STEP plasmas. It is shown that the MHD approximation can reproduce some of the linear properties of the full STEP gyrokinetic system, but is too stable at low $k_y$ and nonlinear simulations using the MHD approximation result in very different transport states. It is demonstrated that the MHD approximation is challenged by the high $\beta^{\prime}$ values in STEP, and that the approximation improves considerably at lower $\beta^{\prime}$. Furthermore, it is shown that the sensitivity of STEP to $\delta \! B_{\parallel}$ fluctuations is primarily because the plasma sits close to marginality and it is shown that in slightly more strongly driven conditions the hKBM is unstable without $\delta \! B_{\parallel}.$ Crucially, it is demonstrated that the state of large transport typically predicted by local electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations of STEP plasmas is not solely due to $\delta \! B_{\parallel}$ physics.</description>

      <title>On the importance of slow ions in the kinetic Bohm criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between a plasma and a solid target lies a positively charged sheath of several Debye lengths $\lambda_{\rm D}$ in width, typically much smaller than the characteristic length scale $L$ of the main plasma. This scale separation implies that the asymptotic limit $\epsilon = \lambda_{\rm D} / L \rightarrow 0$ is useful to solve for the plasma-sheath system. In this limit, the Bohm criterion must be satisfied at the sheath entrance. A new derivation of the kinetic criterion, admitting a general ion velocity distribution, is presented. It is proven that for $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ the distribution of the velocity component normal to the target, $v_x$, and its first derivative must vanish for $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ at the sheath entrance. These two conditions can be subsumed into a third integral one after it is integrated by parts twice. A subsequent interchange of the limits $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ is invalid, leading to a divergence which underlies the misconception that the criterion gives undue importance to slow ions.</description>

      <title>Diag2Diag: Multimodal super-resolution diagnostics for physics discovery with application to fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a groundbreaking multimodal neural network model designed for resolution enhancement, which innovatively leverages inter-diagnostic correlations within a system. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on unimodal enhancement strategies, such as pixel-based image enhancement or heuristic signal interpolation. In contrast, our model employs a novel methodology by harnessing the diagnostic relationships within the physics of fusion plasma. Initially, we establish the correlation among diagnostics within the tokamak. Subsequently, we utilize these correlations to substantially enhance the temporal resolution of the Thomson Scattering (TS) diagnostic, which assesses plasma density and temperature. This enhancement goes beyond simple interpolation, offering a super resolution that preserves the underlying physics inherent in inter-diagnostic correlation. Increasing the resolution of TS from conventional 0.2 kHz to 500 kHz could show the diagnostic capability of capturing the structural evolution of plasma instabilities and the response to external field perturbations, that were challenging with conventional diagnostics. This physics-preserving super-resolution technique may enable the discovery of new physics that were previously undetectable due to resolution limitations or allow for the experimental verification of phenomena that had only been predicted through computationally intensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Driver at 10 MJ and 1 shot/30min for inertial confinement fusion at high gain: efficient, compact, low laser-plasma instabilities, multi-color, low-cost, applicable to multiple fusion schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) set off a global wave of research on the inertial fusion energy (IFE). However, IFE requires a necessary target gain G of 30-100, while it is hard to achieve the fusions at such high gain with the energy, configuration, and technical route of the NIF. We will present a conceptual design for the next generation laser driver of 10 MJ, 2~3 PW at the laser wavelength of 0.353 micrometer (or 0.353 micrometer, then the energy and power can be higher), and 1 shot per 30 minutes, which is efficient, compact, low-cost, low laser-plasma instabilities, applicable to multiple laser fusion schemes, and aiming for G &gt; 30.</description>
