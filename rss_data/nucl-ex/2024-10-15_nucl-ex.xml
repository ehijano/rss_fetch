      <title>Cluster production in Xe + Sn collisions between 65-150 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of the participant-zone (PZ) in the $^{129,124}$Xe + $^{112,124}$Sn reaction at the energy range 65-150 MeV/nucleon reveals copious cluster production. A detailed study of the chemical composition as a function of the impact parameter shows that heavier clusters ($^6$He, $^{6-8}$Li, $^{7-10}$Be...) are most likely produced for central collisions. A hierarchy of the cluster production with the neutron-richness of the total system is observed, suggesting a full mixing of the projectile and target in the PZ. An estimate of the maximum density in central collisions has been deduced from the kinetic energy of the emitted fragments, reaching almost 2 time the normal density (2$\rho_0$) at 150 MeV/nucleon.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future neutrino research program will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for Charge-Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) scattering, on the combination of "nucleon physics" expressed by form factors and "nuclear physics" expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. This talk presents a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas (CFG) Model for CCQE electron-nuclei and neutrino-nuclei scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Meson Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Search for Pauli Exclusion Principle Violations with Gator at LNGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of $\beta^2/2 &lt; 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}$ (90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>
