      <title>Computational Complexity of Envy-free and Exchange-stable Seat Arrangement Problems on Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seat Arrangement Problem is a problem of finding a desirable seat arrangement for given preferences of agents and a seat graph that represents a configuration of seats. In this paper, we consider decision problems of determining if an envy-free arrangement exists and an exchange-stable arrangement exists, when a seat graph is an $\ell \times m$ grid graph. When $\ell=1$, the seat graph is a path of length $m$ and both problems have been known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend it and show that both problems are NP-complete for any integer $\ell \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fixed-Price Mechanism with Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a trade market with one seller and multiple buyers. The seller aims to sell an indivisible item and maximize their revenue. This paper focuses on a simple and popular mechanism--the fixed-price mechanism. Unlike the standard setting, we assume there is information asymmetry between buyers and the seller. Specifically, we allow the seller to design information before setting the fixed price, which implies that we study the mechanism design problem in a broader space. We call this mechanism space the fixed-price signaling mechanism.
  We assume that buyers' valuation of the item depends on the quality of the item. The seller can privately observe the item's quality, whereas buyers only see its distribution. In this case, the seller can influence buyers' valuations by strategically disclosing information about the item's quality, thereby adjusting the fixed price. We consider two types of buyers with different levels of rationality: ex-post individual rational (IR) and ex-interim individual rational. We show that when the market has only one buyer, the optimal revenue generated by the fixed-price signaling mechanism is identical to that of the fixed-price mechanism, regardless of the level of rationality. Furthermore, when there are multiple buyers in the market and all of them are ex-post IR, we show that there is no fixed-price mechanism that is obedient for all buyers. However, if all buyers are ex-interim IR, we show that the optimal fixed-price signaling mechanism will generate more revenue for the seller than the fixed-price mechanism.</description>

      <title>Detecting collusion in procurement auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aimed at detecting cartel collusion involved analyzing decisions of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service and data on auctions. As a result, a machine learning model was developed that predicts with 91% accuracy the signs of collusion between bidders based on their history after dividing 40 auctions into test and training samples in a 30/70 ratio. Decomposition of the model using the Shepley vector allowed the interpretation of the decision-making process. The behavior of honest companies in auctions was also studied, confirmed by independent simulation validation.</description>

      <title>The Competition Complexity of Prophet Secretary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classic single-choice prophet secretary problem through a resource augmentation lens. Our goal is to bound the $(1-\epsilon)$-competition complexity for different classes of online algorithms. This metric asks for the smallest $k$ such that the expected value of the online algorithm on $k$ copies of the original instance, is at least a $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation to the expected offline optimum on the original instance (without added copies).
  We consider four natural classes of online algorithms: single-threshold, time-based threshold, activation-based, and general algorithms. We show that for single-threshold algorithms the $(1-\epsilon)$-competition complexity is $\Theta(\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ (as in the i.i.d. case). Additionally, we demonstrate that time-based threshold and activation-based algorithms (which cover all previous approaches for obtaining competitive-ratios for the classic prophet secretary problem) yield a sub-optimal $(1-\epsilon)$-competition complexity of $\Theta\left(\frac{\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}{\ln\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}\right)$, which is strictly better than the class of single-threshold algorithms. Finally, we find that the $(1-\epsilon)$-competition complexity of general adaptive algorithms is $\Theta(\sqrt{\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})})$, which is in sharp contrast to $\Theta(\ln\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ in the i.i.d. case.</description>

      <title>On Truthful Mechanisms without Pareto-efficiency: Characterizations and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating heterogeneous and indivisible goods among strategic agents, with preferences over subsets of goods, when there is no medium of exchange. This model captures the well studied problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods. Serial-quota mechanisms are allocation mechanisms where there is a predefined order over agents, and each agent in her turn picks a predefined number of goods from the remaining goods. These mechanisms are clearly strategy-proof, non-bossy, and neutral. Are there other mechanisms with these properties? We show that for important classes of strict ordinal preferences (as lexicographic preferences, and as the class of all strict preferences), these are the only mechanisms with these properties. Importantly, unlike previous work, we can prove the claim even for mechanisms that are not Pareto-efficient. Moreover, we generalize these results to preferences that are cardinal, including any valuation class that contains additive valuations. We then derive strong negative implications of this result on truthful mechanisms for fair allocation of indivisible goods to agents with additive valuations.</description>

      <title>Sound Value Iteration for Simple Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic analysis of Markov decision processes (MDP) and stochastic games (SG) in practice relies on value-iteration (VI) algorithms. Since the basic version of VI does not provide guarantees on the precision of the result, variants of VI have been proposed that offer such guarantees. In particular, sound value iteration (SVI) not only provides precise lower and upper bounds on the result, but also converges faster in the presence of probabilistic cycles. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable to SG, nor to MDP with end components. In this paper, we extend SVI and cover both cases. The technical challenge consists mainly in proper treatment of end components, which require different handling than in the literature. Moreover, we provide several optimizations of SVI. Finally, we also evaluate our prototype implementation experimentally to confirm its advantages on systems with probabilistic cycles.</description>

      <title>Resonance: Transaction Fees for Heterogeneous Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11789v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain networks are facing increasingly heterogeneous computational demands, and in response, protocol designers have started building specialized infrastructure to supply that demand. This paper introduces Resonance: a new kind of transaction fee mechanism for the general two-sided market setting (with users on one side and nodes on the other), where both sides of the market exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. We allow users submitting transactions to have arbitrary valuations for inclusion, nodes responsible for executing transactions to incur arbitrary costs for running any bundle of transactions, and further allow for arbitrary additional constraints on what allocations are valid. These constraints can, for example, be used to prevent state conflicts by requiring transactions that utilize the same part of the network's state to not be executed in parallel. They also enable support for new transaction types, such as transactions that require multiple nodes for execution (e.g. to run multi-party computation for better transaction privacy).
  Resonance's design utilizes competition among sophisticated brokers to find individualized prices for each transaction and node. We show that at pure Nash equilibria, Resonance finds an efficient outcome and minimizes the need for strategization by users and nodes. It is also budget-balanced, individually rational for all parties, and computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Path Finding for Timed Tasks using Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems such as hospital robots and package delivery drones often operate in highly uncertain environments and are expected to achieve complex temporal task objectives while ensuring safety. While learning-based methods such as reinforcement learning are popular methods to train single and multi-agent autonomous systems under user-specified and state-based reward functions, applying these methods to satisfy trajectory-level task objectives is a challenging problem. Our first contribution is the use of weighted automata to specify trajectory-level objectives, such that, maximal paths induced in the weighted automaton correspond to desired trajectory-level behaviors. We show how weighted automata-based specifications go beyond timeliness properties focused on deadlines to performance properties such as expeditiousness. Our second contribution is the use of evolutionary game theory (EGT) principles to train homogeneous multi-agent teams targeting homogeneous task objectives. We show how shared experiences of agents and EGT-based policy updates allow us to outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods in minimizing path length by nearly 30\% in large spaces. We also show that our algorithm is computationally faster than deep RL methods by at least an order of magnitude. Additionally our results indicate that it scales better with an increase in the number of agents as compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Addressing Bias in Online Selection with Limited Budget of Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a hiring process with candidates coming from different universities. It is easy to order candidates with the same background, yet it can be challenging to compare them otherwise. The latter case requires additional costly assessments, leading to a potentially high total cost for the hiring organization. Given an assigned budget, what would be an optimal strategy to select the most qualified candidate? We model the above problem as a multicolor secretary problem, allowing comparisons between candidates from distinct groups at a fixed cost. Our study explores how the allocated budget enhances the success probability of online selection algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibria in Standard First-Price and All-Pay Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium (BCCE) of continuous and discretised first-price and all-pay auctions under the standard symmetric independent private-values model. Our study is motivated by the question of how the canonical Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) of the auction relates to the outcomes learned by buyers utilising no-regret algorithms. Numerical experiments show that in two buyer first-price auctions the Wasserstein-$2$ distance of buyers' marginal bid distributions decline as $O(1/n)$ in the discretisation size in instances where the prior distribution is concave, whereas all-pay auctions exhibit similar behaviour without prior dependence. To explain this convergence to a near-equilibrium, we study uniqueness of the BCCE of the continuous auction. Our uniqueness results translate to provable convergence of deterministic self-play to a near equilibrium outcome in these auctions. In the all-pay auction, we show that independent of the prior distribution there is a unique BCCE with symmetric, differentiable, and increasing bidding strategies, which is equivalent to the unique strict BNE. In the first-price auction, we need stronger conditions. Either the prior is strictly concave or the learning algorithm has to be restricted to strictly increasing strategies. Without such strong assumptions, no-regret algorithms can end up in low-price pooling strategies. This is important because it proves that in repeated first-price auctions such as in display ad actions, algorithmic collusion cannot be ruled out without further assumptions even if all bidders rely on no-regret algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Game-theoretic Approach to Urban Evacuation Routing and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evacuation planning is an essential part of disaster management where the goal is to relocate people under imminent danger to safety. However, finding jointly optimal evacuation routes and schedule that minimizes the average evacuation time or evacuation completion time, is a computationally hard problem. As a result, large-scale evacuation routing and scheduling continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach to tackle this problem. We start by formulating a strategic routing and scheduling game, named the Evacuation Game: Routing and Scheduling (EGRES), where players choose their route and time of departure. We show that: (i) every instance of EGRES has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium, and (ii) an optimal outcome in an instance will always be an equilibrium in that instance. We then provide bounds on how bad an equilibrium can be compared to an optimal outcome. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time algorithm, the Sequential Action Algorithm (SAA), for finding equilibria in a given instance under a special condition. We use Virginia Beach City in Virginia, and Harris County in Houston, Texas as study areas and construct two EGRES instances. Our results show that, by utilizing SAA, we can efficiently find equilibria in these instances that have social objective close to the optimal value.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Learning for Dynamic Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today mobile users learn and share their traffic observations via crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Waze). Yet such platforms simply cater to selfish users' myopic interests to recommend the shortest path, and do not encourage enough users to travel and learn other paths for future others. Prior studies focus on one-shot congestion games without considering users' information learning, while our work studies how users learn and alter traffic conditions on stochastic paths in a human-in-the-loop manner. Our analysis shows that the myopic routing policy leads to severe under-exploration of stochastic paths. This results in a price of anarchy (PoA) greater than $2$, as compared to the socially optimal policy in minimizing the long-term social cost. Besides, the myopic policy fails to ensure the correct learning convergence about users' traffic hazard beliefs. To address this, we focus on informational (non-monetary) mechanisms as they are easier to implement than pricing. We first show that existing information-hiding mechanisms and deterministic path-recommendation mechanisms in Bayesian persuasion literature do not work with even (\text{PoA}=\infty). Accordingly, we propose a new combined hiding and probabilistic recommendation (CHAR) mechanism to hide all information from a selected user group and provide state-dependent probabilistic recommendations to the other user group. Our CHAR successfully ensures PoA less than (\frac{5}{4}), which cannot be further reduced by any other informational (non-monetary) mechanism. Besides the parallel network, we further extend our analysis and CHAR to more general linear path graphs with multiple intermediate nodes, and we prove that the PoA results remain unchanged. Additionally, we carry out experiments with real-world datasets to further extend our routing graphs and verify the close-to-optimal performance of our CHAR.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Neyman-Pearson Detection to Combat Strategic Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents receive private signals about an unknown state. The resulting joint belief distributions are complex and lack a simple characterization. Our key insight is that, when conditioned on the state, the structure of belief distributions simplifies: feasibility constrains only the marginal distributions of individual agents across states, with no joint constraints within a state. We apply this insight to multi-receiver persuasion, identifying new tractable cases and introducing optimal transportation and duality tools.</description>

      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an auction, a seller may masquerade as one or more bidders in order to manipulate the clearing price. We characterize single-item auction formats that are shill-proof in the sense that a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is nonpositive. The Dutch auction (with a suitable reserve) is the unique (revenue-)optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Moreover, the Dutch auction (with no reserve) is the unique prior-independent auction that is both efficient and weakly shill-proof. While there are multiple ex-post incentive compatible, weakly shill-proof, and optimal auctions; any optimal auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, ex-post incentive compatible, weakly shill-proof}.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed shares of benefits and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the self-ownership viewpoint to regulate the utilisation of common property resources. Allocating to each agent "the fruit of their own labor" is typically ill-depned, so we look for tight approximations of this decentralised ideal. For each agent i two guarantees limit, from above and below, the impact of other agents on i's allocation. They limit the range of unscripted negotiations, or the choice of a full sharing rule. Our context-free model of the commons is a mapping W from profiles of "types" to a freely transferable amount of benefit or cost. If W is super (resp. sub) modular there is a single tight upper (resp. lower) guarantee, and an infinite menu of tight lower (resp. upper) guarantees, each one conveying a precise normative viewpoint. We describe the menu for essentially all modular two person problems, and familiar examples like the allocation of an indivisible item, cooperative production, and facility location.</description>

      <title>Loss Aversion and State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, that incorporates the possibility of loss-aversion. Our results relate to first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Envy-Free Permanency in Child Welfare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Caseworkers in foster care systems seek to place waiting children in the most suitable homes. Furthermore, social work guidelines prioritize heterogeneous attributes of children and homes when deliberating placements. We use insights from market design and dynamic matching to characterize a class of dynamically envy-free mechanisms that incentivize expedient placements when children and homes arrive to the market over time and homes may accept or decline placements. The mechanisms have robustness against justified envy and costly patience. We analyze strategic incentives and efficiency properties of dynamic envy-freeness. Finally, we conduct empirical simulations that affirm that our mechanisms drastically increase placements and reduce waiting costs while maintaining robustness to prediction error versus a naive mechanism that always sequentially runs Deferred Acceptance. Practitioners can implement our mechanisms through assigning priority to child-home matches.</description>
