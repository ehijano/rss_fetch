      <title>Future 21cm constraints on dark matter energy injection: Application to ALPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we briefly summarize how decaying dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint on the 21cm power spectrum. We discuss the first Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array telescope (HERA) and argue that HERA can improve by up to three orders of magnitude previous cosmology constraints. In these proceedings, we project these future bounds in the plane of the Axion like particles (ALP) coupling to photons as a function of the ALP mass. We focus on the ALP mass range between $\sim$ 10 keV and 1 MeV where the 21cm signal power spectrum probes are expected to improve on any other current dark matter searches. This illustrates how 21cm cosmology can be expected to help in probing uncharted regions of the dark matter parameter space beyond the reach of existing astro-particle and cosmology experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological test of an ultraviolet origin of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe is impressively well described by a cosmological constant. However, the observed value of the cosmological constant is much smaller than expected based on quantum field theories. Recent efforts to achieve consistency in these theories have proposed a relationship between Dark Energy and the most compact objects, such as black holes (BH). However, experimental tests are very challenging to devise and perform. In this article, we present a testable model with no cosmological constant, in which the accelerated expansion can be driven by black holes. The model couples the expansion of the Universe (the Friedmann equation) with the mass-function of cosmological haloes (using the Press-Schechter formalism). Through the observed link between halo-masses and BH-masses one thus gets a coupling between the expansion rate of the Universe and the BHs. We compare the predictions of this simple BH model with SN1a data and find a poor agreement with observations. Our method is sufficiently general that it allows us to also test a fundamentally different model, also without a cosmological constant, where the accelerated expansion is driven by a new force proportional to the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies. Surprisingly enough this model cannot be excluded using the SN1a data.</description>

      <title>A DHOST model of inflation: CMB constraints from the power spectrum and the bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build an inflationary model based on Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories in a de Sitter background. We determine the scale-dependent power spectrum of curvature perturbations in these theories and we show that such a model can be compatible with the latest Planck measurements on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We calculate the bispectrum of curvature perturbations in DHOST models and we directly constrain them using the Planck results on non-Gaussianities. We show that the bispectrum consists of a contribution depending only on the power spectrum parameters and a linear combination of terms depending on new parameters. The former peaks in the squeezed limit, while the latter in the equilateral limit. We use the publicly available CMB-BEST code to directly compare the model predictions to the CMB bispectrum statistics and to marginalise over the free parameters, explicitly showing that there are viable DHOST inflationary models that satisfy both the power spectrum and bispectrum constraints from Planck.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of matter bounce cosmology in Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bouncing cosmologies within the framework of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity. Here, $Q$ represents the non-metricity of the space-time, is determined by the vector field $w_\mu$, while $T$ represents the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our objective is to explore the feasibility of avoiding the Big Bang singularity by implementing a matter-bounce cosmology. To achieve this, we consider a specific model with the functional form $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+\frac{\beta }{6\kappa ^2}T$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters. We analyze the dynamical parameters associated with this model and examine the influence of the Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ theory on these parameters. Moreover, we assess the stability of the proposed model to ensure its viability as a cosmological scenario. Through our analysis, we aim to gain insights into the potential implications and consequences of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity for bouncing scenarios, contributing to our understanding of alternative gravitational theories in the context of cosmology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I briefly review some of the most common map-making strategies for experiments targeting the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in light of the anticipated volumes of data collected by next generation observatories such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4. Then, I focus on the pair-differencing approach, used for example in the POLARBEAR and BICEP collaborations. Using simulations including a number of systematic effects, I evaluate the impact of correlated and unpolarized signals such as coming from the atmosphere, which is a major contaminant for ground-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Using conditional GANs for convergence map reconstruction with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and unravelling the mysteries of dark matter are fundamental challenges in contemporary cosmology. Reconstruction of the cosmological matter distribution from lensing observables, referred to as 'mass-mapping' is an important aspect of this quest. Mass-mapping is an ill-posed problem, meaning there is inherent uncertainty in any convergence map reconstruction. The demand for fast and efficient reconstruction techniques is rising as we prepare for upcoming surveys. We present a novel approach which utilises deep learning, in particular a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), to approximate samples from a Bayesian posterior distribution, meaning they can be interpreted in a statistically robust manner. By combining data-driven priors with recent regularisation techniques, we introduce an approach that facilitates the swift generation of high-fidelity, mass maps. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our approach, we train the model on mock COSMOS-style data, generated using Colombia Lensing's kappaTNG mock weak lensing suite. These preliminary results showcase compelling convergence map reconstructions and ongoing refinement efforts are underway to enhance the robustness of our method further.</description>

      <title>Optimizing blind reconstruction of CMB B-modes for future experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial polarization $B$ modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) requires exquisite control of Galactic foreground contamination. The Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method has proven effective in reconstructing CMB $B$ modes without suffering from mis-modeling errors of Galactic emission. However, with the most complex foreground models, residual Galactic contamination from NILC is proved to bias, especially at large angular scales, the recovered CMB $B$ modes from simulated data of future CMB experiments. We therefore present two new extensions of NILC, Multi-Clustering NILC (MC-NILC) and optimized constrained Moment ILC (ocMILC), which allow to enhance foreground subtraction in the reconstructed CMB signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we interpret the dark energy as an effect caused by small scale inhomogeneities of the universe with the use of the spatial averaged approach of Buchert. The model considered here adopts the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder(CPL) parameterizations of the equation of state of the effective perfect fluid from the backreaction effect. Thanks to the effective geometry introduced by Larena et. al.\cite{larena2009testing} in their previous work, we confront such backreaction model with latest type Ia supernova and Hubble parameter observations, coming out with results that reveal the difference between the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker model and backreaction model.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Non-Gaussian Primordial Tails on Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst current observational evidence favors a close-to-Gaussian spectrum of primordial perturbations, there exist many models of the early Universe that predict this distribution to have exponentially enhanced or suppressed tails. In this work, we generate realizations of the primordial potential with non-Gaussian tails via a phenomenological model; these are then evolved numerically to obtain maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). In the CMB maps, our added non-Gaussianity manifests as a localized enhancement of hot and cold spots, which would be expected to contribute to $N$-point functions up to large $N$. Such models are indirectly constrained by \textit{Planck} trispectrum bounds, which restrict the changes in the temperature fluctuations to $O(10\mu\mathrm{K})$. In the late-time Universe, we find that tailed cosmologies lead to a halo mass function enhanced at high masses, as expected. Furthermore, significant scale-dependent bias in the halo-halo and halo-matter power spectrum is also sourced, which arises from the squeezed limit of large $N$-point functions that are implicitly generated through the enhancement of the tails. These results underscore that a detection of scale-dependent bias alone cannot be used to rule out single field inflation, but can be used together with other statistics to probe a wide range of primordial processes.</description>

      <title>Parity-Odd Power Spectra: Concise Statistics for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Parity-Odd Power (POP) spectra, a novel set of observables for probing parity violation in cosmological $N$-point statistics. POP spectra are derived from composite fields obtained by applying nonlinear transformations, involving also gradients, curls, and filtering functions, to a scalar field. This compresses the parity-odd trispectrum into a power spectrum. These new statistics offer several advantages: they are computationally fast to construct, estimating their covariance is less demanding compared to estimating that of the full parity-odd trispectrum, and they are simple to model theoretically. We measure the POP spectra on simulations of a scalar field with a specific parity-odd trispectrum shape. We compare these measurements to semi-analytic theoretical calculations and find agreement. We also explore extensions and generalizations of these parity-odd observables.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter particles were suggested to have an electric charge smaller than the elementary charge unit $e$. The behavior of such a medium is similar to a collisionless plasma. In this paper, we set new stringent constraints on the charge and mass of the millicharged dark matter particle based on observational data on the Bullet X-ray Cluster.</description>

      <title>Two-Field Quintessential Higgs model and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-field model where a quintessence field with an exponential potential $e^{-\beta\phi/M_P}$ is coupled to the Higgs field. It is claimed that this model is consistent with the proposed Swampland conjecture. We check this claim by calculating its inflationary observables. Although, these observables are in good agreement with the latest CMB data, but we find an upper bound $\beta \lesssim 8\times 10^{-3}$ that strongly disfavors the Swampland conjecture.</description>

      <title>The shape of dark matter halos: a new fundamental cosmological invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the complex relationship between the shape of dark matter halos and the cosmological models underlying their formation. We used three realistic cosmological models from the Dark Energy Universe Simulation suite. They have significantly distinct cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$) but quasi-indistinguishable cosmic matter fields beyond the scale of DM halos. Firstly, we developed a robust method to measure the FoF halos shape, while avoiding numerical artifacts on shape measurements. These artifacts are generally induced by the presence of substructures (resolution-dependent) or by any spherical a priori in contradiction with the halos triaxiality. We obtain a marked dependence of the halos shape, both on their mass and on the cosmological model. However, when re-expressing the halos shape parameters in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field, the cosmological dependence disappears. This new fundamental cosmological invariance is a direct consequence of the matter field non-linear dynamics: as the universe evolves, the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic field increase, driving the halos towards sphericity. The deviation from sphericity, measured by the prolaticity, triaxiality, and ellipticity of the dark matter halos, is therefore entirely encapsulated in the non-linear power spectrum. From this fundamental invariant relation, we can reconstruct with remarkable accuracy the non-linear variance of the cosmic matter field and, consequently, the non-linear power spectrum. We also re-find the $\sigma_8$ amplitude of the cosmological model. Our results highlight, not only the nuanced relationship between dark matter halo formation and the underlying cosmology, but also the potential of dark matter halo shape analysis as a powerful tool for probing the non-linear dynamics of the cosmic matter field.</description>

      <title>Does the Amati Correlation Exhibit Redshift-Driven Heterogeneity in Long GRBs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer significant insights into cosmology due to their high energy emissions and the potential to probe the early universe. The Amati relation, which links the intrinsic peak energy to the isotropic energy, is crucial for understanding their cosmological applications. This study investigates the redshift-driven heterogeneity of the Amati correlation in long GRBs. Analyzing 221 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.034 to 8.2 we divided the dataset based on redshift thresholds of 1.5 and 2. Using Bayesian marginalization and Reichart's likelihood approach, we found significant differences in the Amati parameters between low and high redshift subgroups. These variations, differing by approximately $2\sigma$ at $z = 1.5$ and more than $1\sigma$ at $z = 2$, suggest an evolution in the GRB population with redshift, possibly reflecting changes in host galaxy properties. However, selection effects and instrumental biases may also contribute. Our results challenge the assumption of the Amati relation's universality and underscore the need for larger datasets and more precise measurements from upcoming missions like THESEUS and eXTP to refine our understanding of GRB physics.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Thermal Evolution of the IGM due to Lyman-{\alpha} photons during the Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first star-forming objects which formed at high redshifts during the cosmic dawn (CD) also emitted photons between Lyman-$\alpha$ and Lyman-limit frequencies. These photons are instrumental in coupling the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen (HI) atoms with the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Along with this coupling effect, these photons also impact the kinetic temperature by exchanging energy with the HI atoms. The injected Lyman-$\alpha$ photons in general cool the medium, while the continuum photons heat the medium. While studying this effect in the literature, quasi-static profile around the Lyman-$\alpha$ frequency is assumed. In this paper, we solve the time-dependent coupled dynamics of the photon intensity profile along with the evolution of the thermal state of the IGM and HI spin temperature. It is expected that, during the CD era, the IGM has a mix of continuum photons with 10-20% of injected photons. For this case, we show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium in around 1 Myr, with final temperature in the range 50-100 K. This time scale is comparable to the source lifetime of PopIII stars at high redshifts. One impact of switching off short-lived sources is that it can keep the system heated above the temperature of the quasi-static state. We also show that the quasi-static equilibrium for the continuum photons is only achieved on time scales of 100 Myr at $z\simeq 20$, comparable to the age of the Universe. We also briefly discuss how the Lyman-$\alpha$ induced heating can impact the 21 cm signal from CD.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the matter fluctuations in the Local Universe with the ALFALFA catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology describes the matter fluctuations through the matter power spectrum, where $\sigma_{8} \equiv \sigma_{8,0} \equiv \sigma_{8}(z = 0)$, defined at the scale of $8\,h^{-1}$\,Mpc, acts as a normalisation parameter. Currently, there is a notable discrepancy in the reported values of $\sigma_{8}$ obtained from cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data analyses, which indicates a $\sim 3\,\sigma$ tension between these measurements. This study quantifies matter fluctuations in the Local Universe using HI extragalactic sources mapped by the ALFALFA survey to test the standard cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, $z \approx 0$, quantifying the amplitude of the matter fluctuations there, $\sigma_8$. Our work directly measures $\sigma_{8}$ using the ALFALFA data, where 3D distances were obtained without assuming $H_0$, resulting in a robust model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural network for Lyman break galaxies classification and redshift regression in DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESI is a groundbreaking international project to observe more than 40 million quasars and galaxies over a 5-year period to create a 3D map of the sky. This map will enable us to probe multiple aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to neutrino mass. We are focusing here on one type of object observed by DESI, the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The aim is to use their spectra to determine whether they are indeed LBGs, and if so, to determine their distance from the Earth using a phenomenon called redshift. This will enable us to place these galaxies on the DESI 3D map.
  The aim is therefore to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by QuasarNET (See arXiv:1808.09955), performing simultaneously a classification (LBG type or not) and a regression task (determine the redshift of the LBGs). Initially, data augmentation techniques such as shifting the spectra in wavelengths, adding noise to the spectra, or adding synthetic spectra were used to increase the model training dataset from 3,019 data to over 66,000. In a second phase, modifications to the QuasarNET architecture, notably through transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, boosted model performance.
  Gains of up to 26% were achieved on the Purity/Efficiency curve, which is used to evaluate model performance, particularly in areas with interesting redshifts, at low (around 2) and high (around 4) redshifts. The best model obtained an average score of 94%, compared with 75% for the initial model.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Needlet Internal Linear Combination Maps II: Likelihood-Free Inference on NILC Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard cosmic microwave background (CMB) analyses constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters by fitting parametric models to multifrequency power spectra (MFPS). However, such methods do not optimally weight maps in power spectrum (PS) measurements for non-Gaussian CMB foregrounds. We propose needlet internal linear combination (NILC), operating on wavelets with compact support in pixel and harmonic space, as a weighting scheme to yield more optimal parameter constraints. In a companion paper, we derived an analytic formula for NILC map PS, which is physically insightful but computationally difficult to use in parameter inference pipelines. In this work, we analytically show that fitting parametric templates to MFPS and harmonic ILC PS yields identical parameter constraints when the number of sky components equals or exceeds the number of frequency channels. We numerically show that, for Gaussian random fields, the same holds for NILC PS. This suggests that NILC can reduce parameter error bars in the presence of non-Gaussian fields since it uses non-Gaussian information. As Gaussian likelihoods may be inaccurate, we use likelihood-free inference (LFI) with neural posterior estimation. We show that performing inference with auto- and cross-PS of NILC component maps as summary statistics yields smaller parameter error bars than inference with MFPS. For a model with CMB, an amplified thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal, and noise, we find a 60% reduction in the area of the 2D 68% confidence region for component amplitude parameters inferred from NILC PS, as compared to inference from MFPS. Primordial $B$-mode searches are a promising application for our new method, as the amplitude of the non-Gaussian dust foreground is known to be larger than a potential signal. Our code is available in https://github.com/kmsurrao/NILC-Inference-Pipeline.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics of quantum fluctuations in field theory: with applications to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16295v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for describing quantum fluctuations in field theory, with a focus on cosmological applications. Our method uniquely circumvents the use of operator/Hilbert-space formalism, instead relying on a systematic treatment of classical variables, quantum fluctuations, and an effective Hamiltonian. Our framework not only aligns with standard formalisms in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, which assumes no backreaction, demonstrated through the $\varphi^3$-model, but also adeptly handles time-dependent backreaction in more general cases. The uncertainty principle and spatial symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and understanding effective potentials. We discover that modes inside the Hubble horizon \emph{do not} necessarily feel an initial Minkowski vacuum, as is commonly assumed. Our findings offer fresh insights into the early universe's quantum fluctuations and potential explanations to large-scale CMB anomalies.</description>

      <title>On a Generating Function for the Isotropic Basis Functions and Other Connected Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- i.e. that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

      <title>cp3-bench: A tool for benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms tested with cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmark study of ten symbolic regression algorithms applied to cosmological datasets. We find that the dimension of the feature space as well as precision of datasets are highly important for symbolic regression tasks to be successful. We find no indication that inter-dependence of features in datasets are particularly important, meaning that it is not an issue if datasets e.g. contain both $z$ and $H(z)$ as features. We find no indication that performance of algorithms on standardized datasets are good indications of performance on cosmological datasets. This suggests that it is not necessarily prudent to choose which symbolic regressions algorithm to use based on their performance on standardized data. Instead, a more prudent approach is to consider a variety of algorithms. Overall, we find that most of the benched algorithms do rather poorly in the benchmark and suggest possible ways to proceed with developing algorithms that will be better at identifying ground truth expressions for cosmological datasets. As part of this publication we introduce our benchmark algorithm cp3-bench which we make publicly available at https://github.com/CP3-Origins/cp3-bench. The philosophy behind cp3-bench is that is should be as user-friendly as possible, available in a ready-to-use format, and allow for easy additions of new algorithms and datasets.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the deflection of light rays due to the gravity of intervening masses. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of scales and configurations, involving any non-uniform mass such as planets, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even the large scale structure of the universe. Strong lensing occurs when the distortions are significant and multiple images of the background source are observed. The lens objects must align on the sky of order ~1 arcsecond for galaxy-galaxy lensing, or 10's of arcseonds for cluster-galaxy lensing. As the discovery of lens systems has grown to the low thousands, these systems have become pivotal for precision measurements and addressing critical questions in astrophysics. Notably, they facilitate the measurement of the Universe's expansion rate, dark matter, supernovae, quasars, and the first stars among other topics. With future surveys expected to discover hundreds of thousands of lensing systems, the modelling and simulation of such systems must occur at orders of magnitude larger scale then ever before. Here we present `caustics`, a Python package designed to handle the extensive computational demands of modeling such a vast number of lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Early Galaxies and Early Dark Energy: A Unified Solution to the Hubble Tension and Puzzles of Massive Bright Galaxies revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of ultra-violet (UV)-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ and possibly overly massive galaxies at $z\gtrsim 7$, challenging standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use an empirical galaxy formation model to explore the potential of alleviating these tensions through an Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, originally proposed to solve the Hubble tension. Our benchmark model demonstrates excellent agreement with the UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) at $4\lesssim z \lesssim10$ in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. In the EDE cosmology, the UVLF measurements at $z\simeq 12$ based on spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit no tension with the benchmark model. Photometric constraints at $12 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$ can be fully explained within EDE via either moderately increased star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon_{\ast}\sim 3-10\%$ at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) or enhanced UV variabilities ($\sigma_{\rm UV}\sim 0.8-1.3$ mag at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) that are within the scatter of hydrodynamical simulation predictions. A similar agreement is difficult to achieve in $\Lambda$CDM, especially at $z\gtrsim 14$, where the required $\sigma_{\rm UV}$ exceeds the maximum value seen in simulations. Furthermore, the implausibly large cosmic stellar mass densities inferred from some JWST observations are no longer in tension with cosmology when the EDE is considered. Our findings highlight EDE as an intriguing unified solution to a fundamental problem in cosmology and the recent tensions raised by JWST observations. Data at the highest redshifts reached by JWST ($z \sim 14-16$) will be crucial for differentiating modified galaxy formation physics from new cosmological physics.</description>

      <title>Finding cosmic anisotropy with networks of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model involves the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity, a principle that is generally well-motivated but is now in conflict with various anisotropies found using independent astrophysical probes. These anisotropies tend to take the form of dipoles; while some can be explained by simple kinematic effects, many others are not fully understood. Thus, generic phenomenological models are being considered, such as a dipole in the luminosity distance. We demonstrate how such a dipole could be measured using gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers observed by six different networks of gravitational-wave detectors, ranging from upgraded LIGO detectors to anticipated next-generation ground-based observatories. We find that, for example, a network of three next-generation detectors would produce strong constraints on a dipole's amplitude ($\sim 13\%$) and location ($\sim 84$ deg$^2$) after just one year of observing. We demonstrate that the constraints scale with the number of detections, enabling projections for multiple years of observing. Our findings indicate that future observations of binary neutron star mergers would improve upon existing dipole constraints, provided that at least one next-generation detector is built. We also assess directional sensitivity of the dipole measurements by varying the dipole's location on a grid across the sky. We find that for a network of three next-generation detectors, the range of the constraints is only $\lesssim 1.2\%$ for the amplitude and $\lesssim 4\%$ for the location, indicating that the location of the dipole will not greatly impact our ability to measure its effects.</description>

      <title>CONCERTO at APEX -- On-sky performance in continuum</title>

Abstract: We present the data-processing algorithms and the performance of CONCERTO (CarbON CII line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch) in continuum by analysing the data from the commissioning and scientific observations. The beam pattern is characterized by an effective FWHM of 31.9 $\pm$ 0.6" and 34.4 $\pm$ 1.0" for high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands. The main beam is slightly elongated with a mean eccentricity of 0.46. Two error beams of $\sim$65" and $\sim$130" are characterized, enabling the estimate of a main beam efficiency of $\sim$0.52. The field of view is accurately reconstructed and presents coherent distortions between the HF and LF arrays. LEKID parameters were robustly determined for 80% of the read tones. Cross-talks between LEKIDs are the first cause of flagging, followed by an excess of eccentricity for $\sim$10% of the LEKIDs, all located in a given region of the field of view. On the 44 scans of Uranus selected for the absolute photometric calibration, 72.5% and 78.2% of the LEKIDs are selected as valid detectors with a probability &gt;70%. By comparing Uranus measurements with a model, we obtain calibration factors of 19.5$\pm$0.6 [Hz/Jy] and 25.6$\pm$0.9 [Hz/Jy] for HF and LF. The point-source continuum measurement uncertainties are 3.0% and 3.4% for HF and LF bands. The RMS of CONCERTO maps is verified to evolve as proportional to the inverse square root of integration time. The measured NEFDs for HF and LF are 115$\pm$2 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$ and 95$\pm$1 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$, obtained using CONCERTO data on the COSMOS field for a mean precipitable water vapour and elevation of 0.81 mm and 55.7 deg. CONCERTO demonstrates unique capabilities in fast dual-band spectral mapping with a $\sim$18.5' instantaneous field-of-view. CONCERTO's performance in continuum is perfectly in line with expectations.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparing sampling techniques to chart parameter space of 21 cm Global signal with Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the first billion years of the universe requires studying two critical epochs: the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). However, due to limited data, the properties of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) during these periods remain poorly understood, leading to a vast parameter space for the global 21cm signal. Training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a narrowly defined parameter space can result in biased inferences. To mitigate this, the training dataset must be uniformly drawn from the entire parameter space to cover all possible signal realizations. However, drawing all possible realizations is computationally challenging, necessitating the sampling of a representative subset of this space. This study aims to identify optimal sampling techniques for the extensive dimensionality and volume of the 21cm signal parameter space. The optimally sampled training set will be used to train the ANN to infer from the global signal experiment. We investigate three sampling techniques: random, Latin Hypercube (stratified), and Hammersley Sequence (quasi-Monte Carlo) sampling, and compare their outcomes. Our findings reveal that sufficient samples must be drawn for robust and accurate ANN model training, regardless of the sampling technique employed. The required sample size depends primarily on two factors: the complexity of the data and the number of free parameters. More free parameters necessitate drawing more realizations. Among the sampling techniques utilized, we find that ANN models trained with Hammersley Sequence sampling demonstrate greater robustness compared to those trained with Latin Hypercube and Random sampling.</description>

      <title>The delayed radio emission in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the coupling between the accretion flow and the jet in black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630 by analyzing the X-ray and radio observations during its 2019 outburst. We measure the time delay between the radio and Comptonization fluxes with the interpolated cross-correlation function. For the first time, we find that the radio emission lags behind the X-ray Comptonization emission by about 3 days during the rising phase covering the rising hard state and the following soft state. Such a long radio delay indicates that the Comptonization emission most likely originates from the advection-dominated accretion flow rather than the jet in this source. The Comptonization luminosity $L_{\rm C}$ in 0.1-100 keV and the radio luminosity $L_{\rm R}$ at 5.5 GHz, after considering the radio delay of $\sim 3$ days, follow the correlation with a slope $\beta = 3.04 \pm 0.93$, which is much steeper than the previously reported $\beta = 0.6$ or 1.40 using the total luminosity in the limited band (e.g., 1-10 keV) in the literature. This highlights the necessity of considering (1) the time delay, (2) the spectral decomposition, and (3) the broad energy band, in the radio-X-ray correlation analysis. As the jet reappears during the decaying phase (covering the soft state and the following decaying hard state) and the mini-outburst, the Componization and the radio emission appear to be almost simultaneous. And, the radio-Compton correlation during the mini-outburst becomes shallow with the correlation slope $\beta = 1.11 \pm 0.15$. These indicate an intrinsic difference in the accretion-jet coupling physics between the main outburst and the mini-outburst.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Theoretical and experimental constraints on early-universe models in $F(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates Early Dark Energy (EDE) scenarios as a potential precombination solution to the Hubble tension problem in the $F(R)$ gravity theory. We first develop a dimensionless quantity to visualize the density ratio between the EDE field and matter. Following existing scenarios, we then discuss conditions under which the Hubble tension could be alleviated by introducing a temporary injection of $10\%$ fractional energy around the time of matter-radiation equality between $z=10^{3}-10^{4}$. We further confront these models with local gravity tests and find inconsistencies with observations. Taking a broader view, we convert constraints from local gravity tests into constraints for general EDE in $F(R)$ gravity. We eventually arrive at a no-go theorem for $F(R)$ gravity, which restricts nontrivial modifications to General Relativity in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The host of GRB 171205A in 3D -- A resolved multiwavelength study of a rare grand-design spiral GRB host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long GRB hosts at z&lt;1 are usually low-mass, low metallicity star-forming galaxies. Here we present the until now most detailed, spatially resolved study of the host of GRB 171205A, a grand-design barred spiral galaxy at z=0.036. Our analysis includes MUSE integral field spectroscopy, complemented by high spatial resolution UV/VIS HST imaging and CO(1-0) and HI 21cm data. The GRB is located in a small star-forming region in a spiral arm of the galaxy at a deprojected distance of ~ 8 kpc from the center. The galaxy shows a smooth negative metallicity gradient and the metallicity at the GRB site is half solar, slightly below the mean metallicity at the corresponding distance from the center. Star formation in this galaxy is concentrated in a few HII regions between 5-7 kpc from the center and at the end of the bar, inwards of the GRB region, however, the HII region hosting the GRB is in the top 10% of regions with highest specific star-formation rate. The stellar population at the GRB site has a very young component (&lt; 5 Myr) contributing a significant part of the light. Ionized and molecular gas show only minor deviations at the end of the bar. A parallel study found an asymmetric HI distribution and some additional gas near the position of the GRB, which might explain the star-forming region of the GRB site. Our study shows that long GRBs can occur in many types of star-forming galaxies, however, the actual GRB sites consistently have low metallicity, high star formation and a young population. Furthermore, gas inflow or interactions triggering the star formation producing the GRB progenitor might not be evident in ionized or even molecular gas but only in HI.</description>

      <title>HI and CO spectroscopy of the unusual host of GRB 171205A: A grand design spiral galaxy with a distorted HI field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRBs produced by the collapse of massive stars are usually found near the most prominent star-forming regions of star-forming galaxies. GRB 171205A happened in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy, a peculiar location in an atypical GRB host. In this paper we present a highly-resolved study of the molecular gas of this host, with CO(1-0) observations from ALMA. We compare with GMRT atomic HI observations, and with data at other wavelengths to provide a broad-band view of the galaxy. The ALMA observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 10 km/s, observed when the afterglow had a flux density of ~53 mJy. This allowed a molecular study both in emission and absorption. The HI observations allowed to study the host galaxy and its extended environment. The CO emission shows an undisturbed spiral structure with a central bar, and no significant emission at the location of the GRB. Our CO spectrum does not reveal any CO absorption, with a column density limit of &lt; 10^15 cm^-2. This argues against the progenitor forming in a massive molecular cloud. The molecular gas traces the galaxy arms with higher concentration in the regions dominated by dust. The HI gas does not follow the stellar light or the molecular gas and is concentrated in two blobs, with no emission towards the centre of the galaxy, and is slightly displaced towards the southwest of the galaxy, where the GRB exploded. Within the extended neighbourhood of the host galaxy, we identify another prominent HI source at the same redshift, at a projected distance of 188 kpc. Our observations show that the progenitor of this GRB is not associated to a massive molecular cloud, but more likely related to low-metallicity atomic gas. The distortion in the HI gas field is indicator of an odd environment that could have triggered star formation and could be linked to a past interaction with the companion galaxy.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use angular clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$. Our sample comprises over 12 million targets, covering 14,000 square degrees of the sky, with redshifts in the range $0.2&lt; z &lt; 1.35$. We identify Galactic extinction, survey depth, and astronomical seeing as the primary sources of systematic error, and employ linear regression and artificial neural networks to alleviate non-cosmological excess clustering on large scales. Our methods are tested against simulations with and without $\fnl$ and systematics, showing superior performance of the neural network treatment. The neural network with a set of nine imaging property maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the fiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\fnl = 34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\%(95\%) confidence. We apply a series of robustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show consistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method biases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\fnl$ constraining power. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to using only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate the development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect large-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power. Additionally, our results encourage further studies of $\fnl$ with DESI spectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help separate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\fnl$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A multitracer analysis for the eBOSS galaxy sample based on the effective field theory of large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a multitracer full-shape analysis in Fourier space based on the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS) using the complete Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) DR16 luminous red galaxy (LRG) and emission line galaxy (ELG) samples. We study in detail the impact of the volume projection effect and different prior choices when doing the full-shape analysis based on the EFTofLSS model. We show that adopting a combination of Jeffreys prior and Gaussian prior can mitigate the volume effect and avoid exploring unphysical regions in the parameter space at the same time, which is crucial when jointly analysing the eBOSS LRG and ELG samples. We validate our pipeline using 1000 eBOSS EZmocks. By performing a multitracer analysis on mocks with comparable footprints, we find that cosmological constraints can be improved by $\sim10-35$ per cent depending on whether we assume zero stochastic terms in the cross power spectrum, which breaks the degeneracy and boosts the constraints on the standard deviation of matter density fluctuation $\sigma_8$. Combining with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior and fixing the spectral tilt $n_s$ to Planck value, our multitracer full-shape analysis measures $H_0=70.0\pm2.3~{\mathrm{km}}~{\mathrm{s}}^{-1}{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, $\Omega_m=0.317^{+0.017}_{-0.021}$, $\sigma_8=0.787_{-0.062}^{+0.055}$ and $S_8=0.809_{-0.078}^{+0.064}$, consistent with the Planck~2018 results. In particular, the constraint on $\sigma_8$ is improved beyond that obtained from the single tracer analysis by $18$ per cent, or by $27$ per cent when assuming zero stochastic terms in the cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>CMB constraints on inflection-point inflation with a pseudo-scalar dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the physical aspects of the inflection-point inflation scenario and assess its observational viability in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The model we consider encapsulates the inflaton with a pseudo-scalar (the dark matter candidate) in a complex neutral scalar singlet. The cosmological constraints on the parameters of inflation derived at a high energy scale are translated to a low energy scale by running these parameters. Ensuring the entire Lagrangian to be invariant under a $Z_3$ symmetry with the adequate transformation of the fields, the imaginary part of the singlet decouples from the other scalars of the model. We then investigate if the observational viability of inflation is also compatible with this pseudo-scalar being the dark matter component.We show that the CMB constraints on the inflationary parameters assure that the pseudo-scalar is stable and provides the correct relic dark matter abundance only when the pseudo-scalar is thermally produced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present initial results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Complete Calibration of the Color-Redshift Relation (DC3R2) secondary target survey. Our analysis uses 230k galaxies that overlap with KiDS-VIKING $ugriZYJHK_s$ photometry to calibrate the color-redshift relation and to inform photometric redshift (photo-z) inference methods of future weak lensing surveys. Together with Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), and the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) that provide samples of complementary color, the DC3R2 targets help DESI to span 56% of the color space visible to Euclid and LSST with high confidence spectroscopic redshifts. The effects of spectroscopic completeness and quality are explored, as well as systematic uncertainties introduced with the use of common Self Organizing Maps trained on different photometry than the analysis sample. We further examine the dependence of redshift on magnitude at fixed color, important for the use of bright galaxy spectra to calibrate redshifts in a fainter photometric galaxy sample. We find that noise in the KiDS-VIKING photometry introduces a dominant, apparent magnitude dependence of redshift at fixed color, which indicates a need for carefully chosen deep drilling fields, and survey simulation to model this effect for future weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Recovering 21cm Monopole Signals Without Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect the monopole signal at the lowest frequencies below $100\,$MHz to be composed of two components: the deep Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background and two distinct features: the dark ages trough at $\sim 17\,$MHz and the cosmic dawn trough at $\sim 75\,$Mhz. These are hidden under orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds whose emission is approximately a power-law with a spectral index $\approx -2.5$. It is usually assumed that monopole signals of interest are separable from foregrounds based on spectral smoothness. We argue that this is a difficult approach and likely impossible for the Dark Ages trough. Instead, we suggest that the fluctuations in the foreground emission around the sky should be used to build a model distribution of possible shapes of foregrounds, which can be used to constrain the presence of a monopole signal. We implement this idea using normalizing flows and show that this technique allows for efficient unsupervised detection of the amplitude, width, and center of the Dark Ages trough as well as the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background for a sufficiently sensitive experiment. We show that achromatic and smooth response significantly helps with foreground separation. We discuss the limitations of the inherent assumptions in this method and the impact on the design of future low-frequency experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically Cosmic strings, Magnetic fields, Domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter, and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, cold dark matter (CDM), and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., which has a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. The latest compilation of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data from Pantheon+SH0ES collaboration is used in our analysis to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters and any preferred axis for our universe. In our analysis, we found mild evidence for a cosmic preferred axis. It is interesting to note that this preferred axis lies broadly in the vicinity of other prominent cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature from diverse data sets. Also we find some evidence for non-zero (negative) cosmic shear and eccentricity that characterize different expansion rates in different directions and deviation from an isotropic scale factor respectively. The energy density fractions of two of the sources considered are found to be non-zero at a $2\sigma$ confidence level. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which are expected to be available from the future JWST observations and others.</description>

      <title>Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog (AKRA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is an invaluable tool for understanding fundamental cosmological physics. An unresolved issue in weak lensing cosmology is to accurately reconstruct the lensing convergence $\kappa$ maps from discrete shear catalog with survey masks, which the seminal Kaiser-Squire (KS) method is not designed to address. We present the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog (AKRA) to address the issue of mask. AKRA is built upon the prior-free maximum likelihood mapmaking method (or the unbiased minimum variance linear estimator). It is mathematically robust in dealing with mask, numerically stable to implement, and practically effective in improving the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulated maps with mask fractions ranging from 10\% to 50\% and various mask shapes, we demonstrate that AKRA outperforms KS at both the map level and summary statistics such as the auto power spectrum $C_\kappa$ of the reconstructed map, its cross-correlation coefficient $r_\ell$ with the true $\kappa $ map, the scatter plot and the localization measure. Unlike the Wiener filter method, it adopts no priors on the signal power spectrum, and therefore avoids the Wiener filter related biases at both the map level and cross-correlation statistics. If we only use the reconstructed map in the unmasked regions, the reconstructed $C_\kappa$ is accurate to $1\%$ or better and $1-r_\ell \lesssim 1\%$ (excluding $\ell$ at the smallest scales investigated), even for extreme cases of mask fraction and shape. As the first step, the current version of AKRA only addresses the mask issue and therefore ignores complexities such as curved sky and inhomogeneous shape measurement noise. AKRA is capable of dealing with these issues straightfowrardly, and will be addressed in the next version.</description>

      <title>Possible Impact of non-Gaussianities on cosmological constraints in neutrino physics</title>

Abstract: The search for non-Gaussian signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is crucial for understanding the physics of the early Universe. Given the possibility of non-Gaussian fluctuations in the CMB, a recent revision to the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been proposed, dubbed "Super-$\Lambda$CDM". This model introduces additional free parameters to account for the potential effects of a trispectrum in the primordial fluctuations. In this study, we explore the impact of the Super-$\Lambda$CDM model on current constraints on neutrino physics. In agreement with previous research, our analysis reveals that for most of the datasets, the Super-$\Lambda$CDM parameter $A_0$ significantly deviates from zero at over a $95\%$ confidence level. We then demonstrate that this signal might influence current constraints in the neutrino sector. Specifically, we find that the current constraints on neutrino masses may be relaxed by over a factor of two within the Super-$\Lambda$CDM framework, thanks to the correlation present with $A_0$. Consequently, locking $A_0=0$ might introduce a bias, leading to overly stringent constraints on the total neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation Techniques to Mitigate the Interloper Contamination for Line Intensity Mapping Experiments</title>

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) serves as a potent probe in astrophysics, relying on the statistical analysis of integrated spectral line emissions originating from distant star-forming galaxies. While LIM observations hold the promise of achieving a broad spectrum of scientific objectives, a significant hurdle for future experiments lies in distinguishing the targeted spectral line emitted at a specific redshift from undesired line emissions originating at different redshifts. The presence of these interloping lines poses a challenge to the accuracy of cosmological analyses. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantify line-line cross-correlations (LIM-LLX), enabling us to investigate the true signal amidst instrumental noise and interloping emissions. For example, at a redshift of approximately $z\sim3.7$, we observed that the measured auto-power spectrum of [CII] exhibited substantial bias, from interloping line emission. However, cross-correlating [CII] with CO(6-5) lines using a FYST-like experiment yielded a promising result, with a Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim 10$. This measurement is notably unbiased. Additionally, we explore the extensive capabilities of cross-correlation by leveraging various CO transitions to probe the tomographic Universe at lower redshifts through LIM-LLX. We further demonstrate that incorporating low-frequency channels, such as 90 GHz and 150 GHz, into FYST's EoR-Spec-like experiment can maximize the potential for cross-correlation studies, effectively reducing the bias introduced by instrumental noise and interlopers.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation XLVI. The Near-IR Background Dipole Experiment with Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the fully kinematic nature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole is of fundamental importance in cosmology. In the standard cosmological model with the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric from the inflationary expansion the CMB dipole should be entirely kinematic. Any non-kinematic CMB dipole component would thus reflect the preinflationary structure of spacetime probing the extent of the FLRW applicability. Cosmic backgrounds from galaxies after the matter-radiation decoupling, should have kinematic dipole component identical in velocity with the CMB kinematic dipole. Comparing the two can lead to isolating the CMB non-kinematic dipole. It was recently proposed that such measurement can be done using the near-IR cosmic infrared background (CIB) measured with the currently operating Euclid telescope, and later with Roman. The proposed method reconstructs the resolved CIB, the Integrated Galaxy Light (IGL), from Euclid's Wide Survey and probes its dipole, with a kinematic component amplified over that of the CMB by the Compton-Getting effect. The amplification coupled with the extensive galaxy samples forming the IGL would determine the CIB dipole with an overwhelming signal/noise, isolating its direction to sub-degree accuracy. We develop details of the method for Euclid's Wide Survey in 4 bands spanning 0.6 to 2 mic. We isolate the systematic and other uncertainties and present methodologies to minimize them, after confining the sample to the magnitude range with negligible IGL/CIB dipole from galaxy clustering. These include the required star-galaxy separation, accounting for the extinction correction dipole using the method newly developed here achieving total separation, accounting for the Earth's orbital motion and other systematic effects.

      <description>arXiv:2402.00600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio. Our framework is model-independent by construction and we discuss possible other applications.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Forecast of the Void Size Function Measurement from the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Void size function (VSF) contains information of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS), and can be used to derive the properties of dark energy and dark matter. We predict the VSFs measured from the spectroscopic galaxy survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of cosmological constraint. We employ a high-resolution Jiutian simulation to get CSST galaxy mock samples based on an improved semi-analytical model. We identify voids from this galaxy catalog using the watershed algorithm without assuming a spherical shape, and estimate the VSFs at different redshift bins from $z=0.5$ to 1.1. We propose a void selection method based on the ellipticity, and assume the void linear underdensity threshold $\delta_{\rm v}$ in the theoretical model is redshift-dependent and set it as a free parameter in each redshift bin. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the CSST VSF measurement can constrain the cosmological parameters to a few percent level. The best-fit values of $\delta_{\rm v}$ are ranging from $\sim-0.4$ to $-0.1$ as the redshift increases from 0.5 to 1.1, which has a distinct difference from the theoretical calculation with $\delta_{\rm v}\simeq-2.7$ assuming the spherical evolution and using particles as tracer. Our method can provide a good reference for void identification and selection in the VSF analysis of the spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultra slow roll inflation using cosmological datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and PTA collaborations have raised the intriguing possibility of excess matter power at small scales. Such an increase can be achieved by ultra slow roll (USR) phase during inflationary epoch. We constrain excess power over small scales within the framework of such models using cosmological datasets, particularly of CMB anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$. We parameterize the USR phase in terms of the e-fold at the onset of USR (counted from the end of inflation) $\bar N_1$ and the duration of USR phase $\Delta N$. The former dictates the scale of enhancement in the primordial power spectrum, while the latter determines the amplitude of such an enhancement. From a joint dataset of CMB, SNIa and galaxy surveys, we obtain $\bar N_1 \lesssim 45$ with no bound on $\Delta N$. This in turn implies that the scales over which the power spectrum can deviate significantly from the nearly scale invariant behavior of a typical slow-roll model is $k \gtrsim 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. On the other hand, the Lyman-$\alpha$ data is sensitive to baryonic power spectrum along the line of sight. We consider a semi-analytic theoretical method and high spectral-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to constrain the model. The Lyman-$\alpha$ data limits both the USR parameters: $\bar N_1 \lesssim 41$ and $\Delta N \lesssim 0.4$. This constrains the amplitude of the power spectrum enhancement to be less than a factor of hundred over scales $1 \lesssim k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim 100$, thereby considerably improving the constraint on power over these scales as compared to the bounds arrived at from CMB spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Distinct radial acceleration relations of galaxies and galaxy clusters supports hyperconical modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravity, with great observational support on local scales. However, to keep GR valid over cosmic scales, some phenomena (such as flat galaxy rotation curves and the cosmic expansion history) require the assumption of exotic dark matter. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) indicates a tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass in galaxies. This suggests that the observations could be better explained by modified gravity theories without exotic matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative theory that was originally designed to explain flat galaxy rotation curves by using a new fundamental constant acceleration $a_0$, the so-called Milgromian parameter. However, this non-relativistic model is too rigid (with insufficient parameters) to fit the large diversity of observational phenomena. In contrast, a relativistic MOND-like gravity naturally emerges from the hyperconical model, which derives a fictitious acceleration compatible with observations. This study analyses the compatibility of the hyperconical model with respect to distinct RAR observations of 10 galaxy clusters obtained from HIFLUGCS and 60 high-quality SPARC galaxy rotation curves. The results show that a general relation can be fitted to most cases with only one or two parameters, with an acceptable $\chi^2$ and $p$-value. These findings suggest a possible way to complete the proposed modification of GR on cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>$n\pi$ phase ambiguity of cosmic birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the rotation angle $\beta$ of cosmic birefringence, which is a recently reported parity-violating signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has a phase ambiguity of $n\pi \,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$. This ambiguity has a significant impact on the interpretation of the origin of cosmic birefringence. Assuming an axion-like particle as the origin of cosmic birefringence, this ambiguity can be partly broken by the anisotropic cosmic birefringence and the shape of the CMB angular power spectra. We also discuss constraints on $\beta$ from existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields and observable implications for primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) postulates have been verified with high precision, yet our understanding of how gravity interacts with matter fields remains incomplete. Various modifications to GR have been proposed in both classical and quantum realms to address these interactions within the strong gravity regime. One such approach is non-minimal coupling (NMC), where the space-time curvature (scalar and tensor) interacts with matter fields, resulting in matter fields not following the geodesics. To probe the astrophysical implications of NMC, in this work, we investigate non-minimally coupled electromagnetic (EM) fields in the presence of black holes. Specifically, we show that primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a possible tool to constrain the NMC parameter. PBHs represent an intriguing cosmological black hole class that does not conform to the no-hair theorem. We model the PBH as a Sultana--Dyer black hole and compare it with Schwarzschild. We examine observables such as the radius of the photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and total deflection angles for non-minimally coupled photons for Schwarzschild and Sultana--Dyer black holes. Both the black hole space-times lead to similar constraints on the NMC parameter. For a PBH of mass $M=10^{-5} M_{\odot}$, the photon sphere will not be formed for one mode. Hence, the photons forming the photon sphere will be highly polarized, potentially leading to observable implications.</description>

      <title>New mechanism for primordial black hole formation from the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new mechanism for the primordial black hole (PBH) production within the QCD axion framework. We take the case where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks during inflation, resulting in a $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall network that re-enters horizon sufficiently late. Therefore, closed axion domain walls naturally arising in the network are sufficiently large to collapse into PBHs. Our numerical simulation shows that $\sim 0.3\%$ of the total wall area is in the form of closed walls. In addition, the relic abundance of dark matter is dominantly accounted for by free axions from the collapse of open walls bounded by strings. In this framework, the abundance of PBH within dark matter is calculated to be $\sim 0.9\%$. This fraction remains unaffected by axion parameters or the re-entering horizon temperature, as it is determined by the fixed proportion of closed walls in the network, governed by the principles of percolation theory. The resultant PBHs uniformly share the same mass, which spans from about $10^{-9}$ to $1$ solar mass, corresponding to the classical QCD axion mass window $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$~eV and the re-entering horizon temperature $300-1$~MeV. Intriguingly, PBHs in this mechanism can naturally account for the ultrashort-timescale gravitational microlensing events observed by the OGLE collaboration.</description>

      <title>Action and energy clustering of stellar streams in deforming Milky Way dark matter haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the spherical MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the spherical mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.</description>

      <title>Observability of CMB spectrum distortions from dark matter annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even after dark matter chemically freezes out in the early universe, electromagnetic cascades from dark matter annihilation can still perturb the background photon spectrum when the universe temperature cools down to 0.5 keV. We revisit the CMB spectrum distortions caused by $s$-wave dark matter annihilation under the updated Planck data and the future CMB sensitivity, concluding that $s$-wave annihilation cannot create observable distortions under forecast sensitivities of the (Super-)PIXIE missions. We further detail the case of $p$-wave dark matter annihilation, demonstrating the observability of the primordial $\mu$-distortion. Taking current constraints from primordial light elements, structure formations, cosmic electron-positron rays, and gamma rays, we find that the $\mu$-distortion reaching the observational limit as large as $\mu\simeq 3\times 10^{-8}$ can only be realized with a dark matter mass at 10--50 MeV and a kinetic decoupling temperature around 1 keV. The upper bound of the $p$-wave annihilation cross section can be strengthened by an order of magnitude if the $\mu$-distortion is not detected.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, the Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 yr, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light-curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and they demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the prevalence of giant radio galaxies (GRGs), some of the largest structures powered by supermassive black holes, within supercluster environments, and the influence of such environments on their properties. Utilising two large catalogues of superclusters (401) and GRGs (1446), we established the existence of 77 GRGs (5.3%) residing in 64 superclusters (16%) within $\rm 0.05 \leq z \leq 0.42$. Among the 77 GRGs found in superclusters, we identified $\sim$70% as residing within galaxy clusters. Within the subset of GRGs not located in superclusters, which constitutes 94.7% of the sample, a mere 21% are associated with galaxy clusters, while the remaining majority are situated in sparser environments. We examined the influence of differing environments, such as cluster versus non-cluster and supercluster versus non-supercluster regions, on the size of GRGs, while also exploring the driving factors behind their overall growth. Our findings show that the largest GRGs ($\gtrsim$3 Mpc) grow in underdense environments beyond the confines of dense environments. Moreover, we show that $\sim$ 24% of 1446 GRGs reside in galaxy clusters. We conclude that GRGs preferentially grow in sparser regions of the cosmic web and have a significantly larger median size. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of GRGs as astrophysical probes with specific cases where GRGs, exhibiting polarised emissions and located behind superclusters (acting as natural Faraday screens), were used to estimate magnetic field strengths of the supercluster environment at sub-microgauss levels.</description>

      <title>Is Lensing Amplitude Anomaly in the Cosmic Microwave Background the Evidence of Extremely Low Frequency Primordial Gravitational Wave?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectories of photons of cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the surface of last scattering to us could be deflected by extremely low frequency primordial gravitational wave (PGW). With large scale structure (LSS) producing a smoothing of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropies through weak lensing, the presence of extremely low frequency PGW could enhance the effect of weak lensing on CMB due to the coupling of extremely low frequency PGW and LSS, thus, give rise to much more smoothing of the spectrum. This may be an natural explanation for the lensing amplitude anomaly observed by Planck, meaning that lensing amplitude anomaly may be the evidence of extremely low frequency PGW.</description>
