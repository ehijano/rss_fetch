      <title>Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.</description>

      <title>Zip shift Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new extension in symbolic dynamics on two sets of alphabets, called the zip shift space. In finite case, it represents a finite-to-1 local homeomorphism called zip shift map. Such extension, offers a conjugacy between some endomorphisms and some zip shift map over two-sided space with finite sets of alphabets. As an application, the topological conjugacy of an N-to-1 uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe map with a zip shift map and its orbit structure is investigated. Moreover, the pre-image studies over zip shift space and the concepts of stable and unstable sets and homoclinic orbits, with a precise description for N-to-1 horseshoe are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Seismic regularity coefficient changes precede stronger earthquakes in Santorini swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have been analyzing the ongoing seismic swarm in Santorini, Greece, with the Seismic Regularity (dc) and Seismic Strain Dynamics (SSD) coefficients, which quantify temporal changes in seismic process organization and strain energy release. Stronger earthquakes are preceded by characteristic down-up changes of dc. Such a change indicates an increase in the seismic process regularity followed by a fast transition to a more irregular and chaotic seismic regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures of chaos in noisy tomography</title>

Abstract: How does quantum chaos lead to rapid scrambling of information as well as errors across a system when one introduces perturbations in the dynamics? What are its consequences for the reliability of quantum simulations and quantum information processing? We employ continuous measurement quantum tomography as a paradigm to study these questions. The measurement record is generated as a sequence of expectation values of a Hermitian observable evolving under repeated application of the Floquet map of the quantum kicked top. Interestingly, we find that the reconstruction fidelity initially increases regardless of the degree of chaos or the strength of perturbations in the dynamics. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a random initial observable, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. More importantly, this also gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We define a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed system dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos and quantifies the spread of errors. Our results demonstrate not only a fundamental link between Loschmidt echo and scrambling of errors, as captured by "error OTOCs", but that such a link can have operational consequences in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. Here we introduce a hierarchical framework that enables to harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain characteristics, and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscience and medical data. In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes, paving the way toward DSR foundation models.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>
