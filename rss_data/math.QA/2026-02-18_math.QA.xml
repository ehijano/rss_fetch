      <title>Symmetry shifting for monoidal bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every braiding on a monoidal bicategory induces a monoidal structure on its bicategory of monoids, such that if the former is sylleptic or symmetric then the latter is braided or symmetric, respectively. This extends a classic theorem of Joyal and Street for monoidal categories. The proof presented in this paper is an application of the $\infty$-operadic Additivity Theorem and thereby averts any considerable calculations.</description>

      <title>Relative and lax volutive categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a relative volutive (higher) category, specializing to the notion of a lax volutive (higher) category. Our primary motivation to study these objects is the following: while any rigid symmetric monoidal category admits a volutive structure, any closed symmetric monoidal category admits a lax volutive structure. We develop some of the basic theory of relative volutive categories and provide several equivalent formulations of lax volutive categories. We then study examples of interest, including categories of complete bornological vector spaces and modules over star-rings. We will also separately discuss unbounded operators between Hilbert spaces and Morita 2-categories, the latter of which in the context of fully closed symmetric monoidal 2-categories.</description>

      <title>Automorphism group schemes of lattice vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a positive definite even lattice and a commutative ring, there is a standard construction of a lattice vertex algebra over the commutative ring, and it admits a natural grading by non-negative integers. We describe the groups of automorphisms of these graded vertex algebras as affine group schemes, showing in particular that each is an extension of an explicitly described split reductive group of ADE type by the outer automorphism group of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory III: Structural Quantum Codes over Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the quantum component of Algebraic Phase Theory by showing that quantum phase, Weyl noncommutativity, and stabiliser codes arise as unavoidable algebraic consequences of Frobenius duality. Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.
  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.
  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>
