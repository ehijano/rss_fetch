      <title>Swift X-Ray and UV Observations of six Gaia Binaries supposedly containing a Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have led to the discovery of numerous optically selected binaries containing an undetected component with mass consistent with a compact object (neutron star or white dwarf). Using the the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory we have carried out X-ray and UV observations of a small sample of these binaries. Four systems are wide (with orbital period P&gt;300 d), and they were chosen because of their small distance (d&lt;250 pc) and the mass of the collapsed component favoring a neutron star. Two other are compact systems (P&lt;0.9 d), with convincing evidence of containing a neutron star. The source 2MASS J15274848$+$3536572 was detected in the X-ray band, with a flux of 5E-13 erg/cm2/s and a spectrum well fitted by a power law or a thermal plasma emission model. This source also showed an UV (2200 Angstrom) excess, which might indicate the presence of mass accretion. For the other targets we derived X-ray flux upper limits of the order of 1E-13}$ erg/cm2/s . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the collapsed component in these six systems are neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The impact of different magnetic braking prescriptions on the evolution of LMXBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the evolution of low-mass close binary systems under different magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions. We study binaries with a neutron star accretor. During mass transfer episodes, these systems emit X-rays and are known as Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). When mass transfer stops, they can be observed as binary pulsars. Additionally, some of these systems can experience mass transfer while having orbital periods of less than 1 hr, thus evolving into ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). The evolution of LMXBs depends on their capability to lose angular momentum and maintain stable mass transfer. Among the angular momentum loss mechanisms, MB is one important, and still uncertain phenomenon. The standard MB prescription faces some problems when calculating LMXB evolution, leading to, e.g., a fine-tuning problem in the formation of UCXBs. Recent studies proposed new MB prescriptions, yielding diverse outcomes. Here, we investigate the effects of three novel MB prescriptions on the evolution of LMXBs using our stellar code. We found that all MB prescriptions considered allow the formation of binaries with orbital periods spanning from less than one hour to more than tens of days. Remarkably, our results enable the occurrence of wide systems even for the MB law that causes the strongest angular momentum losses and very high mass transfer rates. We found that models computed with the strongest MB prescription reach the UCXB state starting from a wider initial orbital period interval. Finally, we discuss and compare our results with observations and previous studies performed on this topic.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the RX J0209.6-7427 X-ray Spectrum During Giant Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the spectral formation occurring in the binary X-ray pulsar RX~J0209.6-7427 during the 2019 super-Eddington outburst. Using a theoretical model previously developed by the authors, we are able to produce spectra that closely resemble the phase-averaged X-ray spectra observed using NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT during low and high luminosity states of the outburst, respectively. The theoretical model simulates the accretion of fully ionized gas in a dipole magnetic field, and includes a complete description of the radiation hydrodynamics, matter distribution, and spectral formation. Type II X-ray outbursts provide an opportunity to study accretion over a large range of luminosities for the same neutron star. The analysis performed here represents the first time both the outburst low and high states of an accretion-powered X-ray pulsar are modeled using a physics-based model rather than standard phenomenological fitting with arbitrary mathematical functions. We find the outer polar cap radius remains constant and the column is more fully-filled with increasing luminosity, Comptonized bremsstrahlung dominates the formation of the phase-averaged X-ray spectrum, and a negative correlation exists between cyclotron centroid energy and luminosity, as expected. The super-Eddington nature of the outburst is rendered possible due to the low scattering cross section for photons propagating parallel to the magnetic field. We also find emission through the column top dominates in both the low and high states, implying the pulse profiles should have a roughly sinusoidal shape, which agrees with observed properties of ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>New Timing Results of MSPs from NICER Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are known for their long-term stability. Using six years of observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the X-ray timing results for six MSPs: PSRs B1937+21, B1821$-$24, J0437$-$4715, J0030+0451, J0218+4232, and J2124$-$3358. The timing stability parameter $\sigma_z$ has been calculated, revealing remarkable timing precision on the order of $10^{-14}$ for PSRs B1937+21 and J0437$-$4715, and $10^{-13}$ for PSRs B1821$-$24, J0218+4232, and J0030+0451 over a timescale of 1000 days. These findings underscore the feasibility of autonomous in-orbit timekeeping using X-ray observations of MSPs. In addition, the consistency of long-term spin-down noise in the X-ray and radio bands has been investigated by comparison with IPTA radio data.</description>

      <title>Relativistic tidal separation of binary stars by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary stellar system that ventures too close to a supermassive black hole can become tidally separated. In this article, we investigate the role of relativistic effects in these encounters through 3-body simulations. We use the Hybrid Relativistic-Newtonian Approximation (HRNA), which combines the exact relativistic acceleration from a Schwarzschild black hole with a Newtonian description of the binary's self-gravity. This method is compared against Newtonian and Post-Newtonian (1PN) simulations. Our findings show good agreement between HRNA and 1PN results, both of which exhibit substantial differences from Newtonian simulations. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced in retrograde encounters, where relativistic simulations predict up to $30\%$ more separation events and an earlier onset of binary separation ($\beta=2$ compared to $2.5$ in Newtonian simulations, with $\beta$ the impact parameter). Additionally, the HRNA model predicts about 15$\%$ more potential extreme mass ratio inspirals and generate a higher number of hypervelocity star candidates, with velocities up to 2,000 km/s faster than those predicted from Newtonian simulations. Furthermore, compared to Newtonian cases, relativistic encounters are more likely to result in direct stellar collisions and binary mergers.</description>

      <title>The fast X-ray transient EP240315a: a z ~ 5 gamma-ray burst in a Lyman continuum leaking galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the minute-to-hour long Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) localised by telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton remains mysterious, with numerous models suggested for the events. Here, we report multi-wavelength observations of EP240315a, a 1600 s long transient detected by the Einstein Probe, showing it to have a redshift of z=4.859. We measure a low column density of neutral hydrogen, indicating that the event is embedded in a low-density environment, further supported by direct detection of leaking ionising Lyman-continuum. The observed properties are consistent with EP240315a being a long-duration gamma-ray burst, and these observations support an interpretation in which a significant fraction of the FXT population are lower-luminosity examples of similar events. Such transients are detectable at high redshifts by the Einstein Probe and, in the (near) future, out to even larger distances by SVOM, THESEUS, and Athena, providing samples of events into the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Study of {\gamma}-ray Emission from a Compact Radio Galaxy with the Fermi Large Area Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 is classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS) and belongs to the class of young Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we investigate the $\gamma$-ray emission from this CSS by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 15 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observation data. The Fermi-LAT latest Source Catalog, 4FGL-DR4, includes an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source, 4FGL J1010.0+1416, located at 0.24{\deg} away from the radio position of PKS 1007+142. Using the 15 yr Fermi-LAT observation data, we re-estimate the best-fit position of the $\gamma$-ray source and find that PKS 1007+142 is in close proximity to the $\gamma$-ray source and falls within its 68% error circle. Therefore, we conclude that PKS 1007+142 is the most plausible counterpart to the unassociated LAT source with a detection test statistics (TS) $\sim$43.4 ($\sim 6.6\sigma$). PKS 1007+142 exhibits a steep power-law spectrum in the 0.1--300 GeV band, with a photon spectral index ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$) of $2.86\pm0.17$. The average flux in the considered time interval is $\rm (2.14\pm0.34)\times10^{-12}\ erg\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$. Comparing PKS 1007+142 with other $\gamma$-ray emitting AGNs in both the $L_{\gamma}-\Gamma_{\gamma}$ and $L_\gamma-L_{\rm 1.4GHz}$ planes, it shows a softer $\gamma$-ray spectrum and lower luminosity compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting CSSs. Furthermore, the possible origins of $\gamma$-ray in PKS 1007+142 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray prompt emission from a high-redshift gamma-ray burst EP240315a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from core collapse of massive stars. High-redshift GRBs can probe the star formation and reionization history of the early universe, but their detection remains rare. Here we report the detection of a GRB triggered in the 0.5--4 keV band by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, designated as EP240315a, whose bright peak was also detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope and Konus-Wind through off-line analyses. At a redshift of $z=4.859$, EP240315a showed a much longer and more complicated light curve in the soft X-ray band than in gamma-rays. Benefiting from a large field-of-view ($\sim$3600 deg$^2$) and a high sensitivity, EP-WXT captured the earlier engine activation and extended late engine activity through a continuous detection. With a peak X-ray flux at the faint end of previously known high-$z$ GRBs, the detection of EP240315a demonstrates the great potential for EP to study the early universe via GRBs.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Energetic Particles from T Tauri Flares on Inner Protoplanetary Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Tauri stars are known to be magnetically active stars subject to strong flares observed in X-rays. These flares are likely due to intense magnetic reconnection events during which a part of the stored magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of supra-thermal particles. Since T Tauri stars are surrounded by an accretion disc, these particles may influence the disc dynamics and chemistry. This work continues on a previous stationary model, which showed that energetic particles accelerated during flares can produce a strong ionisation rate at high column densities in the inner accretion disc. The present model includes non-stationary sequences of flaring events sampled by a Chandra X-ray survey of nearby young stellar objects. We calculate the averaged ionisation rate expected in a radius range from 0.08 to 0.6 au from the central star. We confirm that energetic particles produced by the flares dominate the ionisation of the disc up to column densities of $10^{25}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We further study the main consequences of this additional source of ionisation on the viscosity, the accretion rate, the volumetric heating rate and the chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.</description>

      <title>The hunt of PeVatrons as the origin of the most energetic photons observed in our Galaxy</title>

Abstract: Ultrarelativistic particles called cosmic rays permeate the Milky Way, propagating through the Galactic turbulent magnetic fields. The mechanisms under which these particles increase their energy can be reasonably described by current theories of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. There are, however, still many open questions as to how to reach petaelectronvolt (PeV) energies, the maximum energy believed to be attained in our Galaxy, and in which astrophysical sources (dubbed {\it PeVatrons}) this ultra-high energy acceleration happens. In this article, we describe the theoretical conditions for plasma acceleration to these energies, and the Galactic sources in which these conditions are possible. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with the latest experimental results, summarising the state-of-the-art of our current knowledge of PeVatrons. We finally describe the prospects to keep advancing the understanding of these elusive objects, still unidentified more than one hundred years after the discovery of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>A candidate period of 4.605 day for FRB 20121102A and one possible implication of its origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is crucial for determining their origins. Here we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundredmeter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, Arecibo Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, MeerKAT Telescope, Lovell Telescope, Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope spanning the time interval of MJD 57175-58776. A quasi-period of $157.1_{-4.8}^{+5.2}$ day and a candidate quasi-period of $4.605_{-0.010}^{+0.003}$ day are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than $10^{38}$ erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts' originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.</description>

      <title>Deep Hard X-ray Survey of the M81 Field Based on INTEGRAL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a deep survey of the M81 field in the 25-60 keV energy band based on long-term (2003-2023) INTEGRAL observations. A record sensitivity of 0.16 mCrab at a detection significance of 4 sigma has been achieved in the central part of the field owing to the long accumulated exposure (19.2 Ms). The total area of the survey is 1004 deg^2 at a sensitivity level better than 0.72 mCrab. We have produced a catalog of sources detected at a significance level higher than 4 sigma. It contains 51 objects most of which are active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The median redshift of the Seyfert galaxies in the catalog is z=0.0366. Six sources have not been detected previously in any of the X-ray surveys. According to the available indirect data, all of them and two more sources that have already been entered previously into the INTEGRAL survey catalogs can also be AGNs, including those with strong internal absorption.</description>

      <title>A dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant following LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational wave (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs in combination with standard dark sirens from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalog method alone. We use the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts derived by a deep learning method using the DESI Legacy Survey and DELVE galaxy catalogs. We add the constraints from the binary black hole mergers candidates S231226av, S231206cc, S230919bj, S230627c, and S230922g to the sample of standard dark sirens analyzed in Alfradique et al. (2024). We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (3 with updated posteriors), finding $H_0 = 69.9^{+13.3}_{-12.0}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% Highest Density Interval) with the catalog method alone. This result represents an improvement of $\sim 23\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint, and a reduction in uncertainty of $\sim 40\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.3}_{-3.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\sim 6\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\sim 10\%$ .</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), are expected to observe a few 100,000 signals each year. This will require efficient analysis tools and computational resources well beyond the needs of current detectors. Such resources are not presently available to the science community. Therefore, to investigate ET observational capabilities and science cases, Fisher-matrix methods are used to predict how precisely parameters like mass, spin, source distance or sky location can be estimated from ET data. The approach is based on a Gaussian approximation of the likelihood function. However, the reliability of error estimates obtained from Fisher-matrix methods remains an open question. In this article, we present a Fisher-matrix analysis of signals of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC). We compare parameter-estimation errors obtained using the Fisher matrix code GWFish with the errors from the marginal distributions of the Virgo/LIGO posterior analysis. In order to understand the impact of prior distributions on the results, we implemented a Gaussian likelihood sampling algorithm with priors in GWFish. To ensure a fair comparison of the methods, the GWFish analyses presented in this article use the same priors and the same instrument-noise spectra as the Virgo/LIGO posterior analyses. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods, especially if augmented with the use of priors, are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Interstellar Magnetization by Synchrotron Polarization Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method's applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfv\'enic Mach number of MHD turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of $\mathcal{A} \propto M_{\rm A}^{2}$ between polarization intensity variance $\mathcal{A}$ and Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_{\rm A}$, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) data, achieving Alfv\'enic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alf\'enic turbulence, with $M_{\rm A}$ approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Costless correction of chain based nested sampling parameter estimation in gravitational wave data and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of error. This error affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard error estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this error more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual error estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this error correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this error affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent horizon finding problem with multigrid methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>

      <title>The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.
  I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests that it has a small radius and, even more interestingly, a mass of the order or smaller than one solar mass. This raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass, since the analysis of various types of SN explosions indicate that is it not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about $1.17 M_\odot$. Here we show that masses of the order or smaller than one solar mass can be obtained in the case of strange quark stars and that it is possible to build a coherent model explaining not only the mass and the radius of that object, but also its slow cooling suggested in various analyses. We also show that an astrophysical path exists which leads to the formation of such an object, and we discuss the role played in that scenario by strangelets assumed to constitute the dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Unified Geometric Model of Repeating and Non-Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients. They apparently fall into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, such a classification has lacked a motivation on the physical picture. Here we propose a unified geometric model to distinguish between the repeaters and non-repeaters, in which the quasi-tangential (QT) propagation effect within the magnetospheric polar cap of a neutron star is considered. In this model, the non-repeaters arise from the sources whose emitting region has a smaller impact angle with respect to the magnetic axis, while the repeaters come from the sources whose emitting region has a larger impact angle. The observational discriminant polarization properties between the repeaters and non-repeaters are an important clue to verifying this unified geometric model since the polarization is sensitive to the QT propagation effect. Moreover, our model effectively explains all of the other discriminant properties, including bandwidth, duration, peak luminosity, energy, brightness temperature, time-frequency downward drifting, and repetition rate, providing compelling evidence for the magnetospheric origin of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations for gamma-ray burst afterglow light curves and centroid motion independent of jet structure and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for gamma-ray burst afterglow dynamics and synchrotron spectra are known to exhibit various scale invariances, owing to the scale-free nature of fluid dynamics and the power-law shape of synchrotron spectra. Since GRB 170817A, off-axis jet models including a lateral energy structure in the initial outflow geometry have gained in prominence. Here we demonstrate how the scale-invariance for arbitrary jet structure and dynamical stage can be expressed locally as a function of jet temporal light curve slope. We provide afterglow flux expressions and demonstrate their use to quickly assess the physical implications of observations. We apply the scaling expressions to the Swift XRT sample, which shows a spread in observed fluxes, binned by light curve slope at time of observation, that increases with increasing light curve slope. According to the scaling relations, this pattern is inconsistent with a large spread in environment densities if these were the dominant factor determining the variability of light curves. We further show how the late Deep Newtonian afterglow stage remains scale-invariant but adds distinct spectral scaling regimes. Finally, we show that for given jet structure a universal curve can be constructed of the centroid offset, image size and ellipticity (that can be measured using very-large baseline interferometry) versus observer angle, in a manner independent of explosion energy and circumburst density. Our results apply to any synchrotron transient characterized by a release of energy in an external medium, including supernova remnants, kilonova afterglows and soft gamma-repeater flares.</description>

      <title>The Interplay between accelerated Protons, X-rays and Neutrinos in the Corona of NGC 1068: Constraints from Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15222</link>

Abstract: We examine properties of accelerated protons potentially responsible for the neutrino excess observed in the direction of NGC 1068, using constraints from kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. We find that i) coronal X-rays and Optical/Ultra-Violet light in the inner disk lead to efficient absorption of hadronic $\gamma$-rays within 100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole; ii) protons accelerated from the coronal thermal pool cannot account for the observed neutrinos; and iii) explaining the observed signal requires an injection of protons with a hard spectrum, peaking at $\gamma_p\sim 10^3-10^4$, into the turbulent magnetically-dominated corona, where they are confined and re-accelerated. The resulting neutrino signal can be consistent with IceCube observations. In our most favorable scenario, the injected protons are pre-accelerated in intermittent current sheets in the vicinity of the black hole, occurring either at the boundary between the disk and the outflow or during magnetic flux eruption events.</description>

      <title>Time-varying double-peaked emission lines following the sudden ignition of the dormant galactic nucleus AT2017bcc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole, though this cannot be confirmed, and given an estimated black hole mass of $\gtrsim10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ instabilities in an existing disc may be more likely. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z&gt;0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.</description>

      <title>Induced Circular Polarization on Photons Due to Interaction with Axion-Like Particles in Rotating Magnetic Field of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the photon polarization is affected by the interaction with axion-like particles (ALPs) in the rotating magnetic field of a neutron star (NS). Using quantum Boltzmann equations the study demonstrates that the periodic magnetic field of millisecond NSs enhances the interaction of photons with ALPs and creates a circular polarization on them. A binary system including an NS and a companion star could serve as a probe. When the NS is in front of the companion star with respect to the earth observer, there is a circular polarization on the previously linearly polarized photons as a result of the interaction with ALPs there. After a half-binary period, the companion star passes in front of the NS, and the circular polarization of photons disappears and changes to linear. The excluded parameter space for a millisecond NS with 300~Hz rotating frequency, highlights the coupling constant of $1.7\times10^{-11}~\text{GeV}^{-1}\leq g_{a\gamma\gamma}\leq1.6\times10^{-3}~\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses in the range of $7\times10^{-12}~\text{eV}\leq m_a\leq1.5\times 10^{3}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Neutron star kick driven by asymmetric fast-neutrino flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) leads to asymmetric matter ejection and neutrino emission, that potentially accounts for the origin of neutron star (NS) kick. Asymmetric neutrino radiation fields are, in general, accompanied by large-scale inhomogeneous fluid distributions, in particular for electron-fraction ($Y_e$) distributions. Recently, it has also been revealed that lower $Y_e$ environments in proto-neutron star envelope can offer preferable conditions for collective neutrino oscillations. In this paper, we show that a dipole asymmetry of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC), one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes, can power a NS kick, and that it would generate a characteristic correlation between asymmetric distributions of heavy elements in the ejecta and the direction of NS kick. We strengthen our argument for the FFC-driven NS kick mechanism by performing axisymmetric neutrino transport simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We show that this mechanism can generate sufficient linear momentum of neutrinos to account for typical proper motions of NS. Although more detailed studies are necessary, the present study opens a new channel to give a natal NS kick.</description>

      <title>Curvature in the very-high energy gamma-ray spectrum of M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radio galaxy M87 is a variable very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, exhibiting three major flares reported in 2005, 2008, and 2010. Despite extensive studies, the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the VHE gamma-ray spectrum of M87 during states of high gamma-ray activity, utilizing 20.2$\,$ hours the H.E.S.S. observations. Our findings indicate a preference for a curved spectrum, characterized by a log-parabola model with extra-galactic background light (EBL) model above 0.3$\,$TeV at the 4$\sigma$ level, compared to a power-law spectrum with EBL. We investigate the degeneracy between the absorption feature and the EBL normalization and derive upper limits on EBL models mainly sensitive in the wavelength range 12.4$\,$$\mu$m - 40$\,$$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Impacts of nonthermal emission on the images of a black hole shadow and extended jets in two-temperature GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent 230 GHz observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration can image the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy showing the shadow of the black hole, a photon ring, and a ring-like structure that agrees with thermal synchrotron emission from the accretion disc. However, at lower frequencies, M87 is characterized by a large-scale jet with clear signatures of nonthermal emission. It is necessary to explore the impacts of nonthermal emission on black hole shadow images and extended jets, especially at lower frequencies. In this study, we aim to compare models with different electron heating prescriptions and investigate how these prescriptions and nonthermal electron distributions may affect black hole shadow images and the broadband spectrum energy distribution (SED) function. We performed general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in various two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models utilizing different black hole spins and different electron heating prescriptions coupled with different electron distribution functions (eDFs). Through a comparison with GRRT images and SEDs, we found that when considering a variable kappa eDF, the parameterized prescription of the R-beta model with Rh = 1 is similar to the model with electron heating in the morphology of images, and the SEDs at a high-frequency. This is consistent with previous studies using the thermal eDF. However, the nuance between them could be differentiated through the diffuse extended structure seen in GRRT images, especially at a lower frequency, and the behavior of SEDs at low frequency. The emission from the nearside jet region is enhanced in the reconnection heating case and it will increase the contribution from the regions with stronger magnetization is included or if the magnetic energy contribution to kappa eDF mainly in the magnetized regions is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized radio emission of RRAT J1854+0306 is investigated with single pulses using Five-hundred-meter-Aperture Spherical Telescope. Its emission is characterized by nulls, narrow and weak pulses, and occasional wide and intense bursts with a nulling fraction of 53.2%. Its burst emission is typically of one rotation, and occasionally of two or three or even five rotations at the most, but without significant periodicity. The integrated pulse profile has an 'S'-shaped position angle curve that is superposed with orthogonal modes, from which geometry parameters are obtained. Individual pulses exhibit diverse profile morphology with single, double, or multiple peaks. The intensity and width of these pulses are highly correlated, and bright pulses generally have wide profiles with multiple peaks. These nulling behaviours, profile morphology, and polarization demonstrate that a rotating radio transient has the same physical origins as the normal pulsars.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Type II Supernovae Inferred from ZTF and ATLAS Photometric Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modelled via the mass loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a $\beta$ velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (A$_V$), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (M$_{ZAMS}$\,$&lt;$14\,$M_\odot$) with a dense CSM ($\dot{M}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{-3}$ [M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$], a CSM radius of $\sim$ 10$^{15}$ cm, and $\beta$ $&gt;$ 2). Additionally, we find that the redshift inferred from the supernova LCs is significantly more accurate than that inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of SNe II in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on U(1)' Models: from Non-Standard Interactions to Long-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14220v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of gauge bosons from a weakly coupled lepton flavor dependent $U(1)'$ interaction on the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos in the global analysis of oscillation data. The analysis is performed for interaction lengths ranging from the Sun-Earth distance to effective contact neutrino interactions. We survey $\sim 10000$ set of models characterized by the six relevant fermion $U(1)'$ charges and find that in all cases, constraints on the coupling and mass of the $Z'$ can be derived. We also find that about 5% of the $U(1)'$ model charges lead to a viable LMA-D solution but this is only possible in the contact interaction limit. We explicitly quantify the constraints for a variety of models including $U(1)_{B-3L_e}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{B-\frac{3}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{L_e-\frac{1}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$. We compare the constraints imposed by our oscillation analysis with the strongest bounds from fifth force searches, violation of equivalence principle as well as bounds from scattering experiments and white dwarf cooling. Our results show that generically, the oscillation analysis improves over the existing bounds from gravity tests for $Z'$ lighter than $\sim 10^{-11}$ eV. In the contact interaction limit, we find that for most models listed above there are values of $g'$ and $M_{Z'}$ for which the oscillation analysis provides constraints beyond those imposed by laboratory experiments. Finally we illustrate the range of $Z'$ and couplings leading to a viable LMA-D solution for two sets of models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the merger structure of black hole binaries in generic planar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise modeling of binary black hole coalescences in generic planar orbits is a crucial step to disentangle dynamical and isolated binary formation channels through gravitational-wave observations. The merger regime of such coalescences exhibits a significantly higher complexity compared to the quasicircular case, and cannot be readily described through standard parameterizations in terms of eccentricity and anomaly. In the spirit of the Effective One Body formalism, we build on the study of the test-mass limit, and introduce a new modelling strategy to describe the general-relativistic dynamics of two-body systems in generic orbits. This is achieved through gauge-invariant combinations of the binary energy and angular momentum, such as a dynamical "impact parameter" at merger. These variables reveal simple "quasi-universal" structures of the pivotal merger parameters, allowing to build an accurate analytical representation of generic (bounded and dynamically-bounded) orbital configurations. We demonstrate the validity of these analytical relations using 311 numerical simulations of bounded noncircular binaries with progenitors from the RIT and SXS catalogs, together with a custom dataset of dynamical captures generated using the Einstein Toolkit, and test-mass data in bound orbits. Our modeling strategy lays the foundations of accurate and complete waveform models for systems in arbitrary orbits, bolstering observational explorations of dynamical formation scenarios and the discovery of new classes of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of 3D Convective Urca Simulations to Changes in Urca Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. There is a simmering phase in the early stages of burning that involves the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection that may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. Convective Urca is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to realistically model. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) so a low-Mach method is needed to make simulating computationally feasible. Using the MAESTROeX low-Mach hydrodynamics code, we investigate recent changes to how the weak reactions are modeled in the convective Urca simulations. We present results that quantify the changes to the reaction rates and their impact on the evolution of the simulation.</description>
