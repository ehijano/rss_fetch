      <title>Topolectrical circuits $-$ recent experimental advances and developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Nanomechanical Vibrations to Individual Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale defects behaving as two-level systems (TLSs) are crucial to the physics of modern quantum devices. Here, we study interactions between individual TLS defects and the mechanical vibrations of a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator. By applying a mechanical strain, we tune individual TLS onto resonance with the NEMS and observe strong coupling. By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits. Our work establishes a platform for exploring and manipulating TLS-phonon interactions in the single-phonon regime.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian physics from dynamically coupled macrospins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two classical macrospins with dynamical (frequency-dependent) coupling, modeled by a generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We show that, in the absence of local damping, the resulting dynamics are pseudo-Hermitian. When two precessional modes hybridize near a crossing, the spectral behavior takes the form either of an anticrossing or level attraction, with the latter formalized in terms of spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. Near equilibrium, mixing due to nondissipative interactions results in repulsion, while dissipative mixing results in attraction. In contrast, when the fluctuating degrees of freedom form a free-energy saddle point, we find that nondissipative interactions result in level attraction, while dissipative interactions produce level repulsion. Accounting for the effects of local Gilbert damping, we examine the cases in which approximate $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking is still possible and determine the degree to which the qualitative spectral properties still persist.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of large-amplitude parametric oscillations in a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequency. Here, we present measurements of the response of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry of the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. Parametric oscillations with broken phase symmetry hold promise as units of binary information. Their phase states can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Our work invites future studies on coupled graphene parametric resonators whose phase states may be mapped to a system of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Gate-Voltage-Driven Quantum Phase Transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance in quantum point contacts, shaped by entangled-state tunneling, was demonstrated through the movement of a localized spin. This spin responds to variations in side gate voltage, triggering a quantum phase transition (QPT) between symmetric and asymmetric Kondo coupling states, with the states separated by conductance regions $G \geq 0.7 G_0$ and $G \leq 0.7 G_0$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, respectively. The asymmetric state has two Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The presence of two Kondo temperatures in the asymmetric state clarifies previously unresolved issues, such as the indeterminate Kondo temperature and anomalous behavior in the width of the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the $G \leq 0.7 G_0$ region. The QPT was investigated by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent ZBA energy, calculated using the corresponding local density of states at the site of the localized spin, obtained during the replication of the differential conductance.</description>

      <title>Engineering MoS$_2$-MoTe$_2$ Heterojunctions: Enhancing Piezoresponse and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics and various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D materials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open circuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier screening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D materials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that lateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the piezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. Because of the asymmetric contacts with Nickel (Ni) electrodes, the heterojunctions of monolayer(1L) MoS$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ form a hybrid Schottky/p-n diode. We demonstrate a rectification ratio of more than 5000 without electrostatic gating. We observed that devices with higher junction potentials exhibit piezoelectric open-circuit voltages exceeding 1V and a peak power density of 690 mW/m$^2$. The output characteristics reveal a trade-off between open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. These findings and the role of built-in (cut-in) voltages in energy harvesting provide valuable insights for the design of piezotronic junctions to achieve high piezoelectric output and/or rectification ratios. Design aspects of heterojunctions discussed in this manuscript can be applied to other emerging nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Topological Disclination States in Lossy Electric Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions can be remarkably induced purely by manipulating gain and loss mechanisms, offering a novel approach to engineering topological properties. Recent theoretical studies have revealed gain-loss-induced topological disclination states, along with the associated fractional charge trapped at the disclination sites. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of topological disclination states in a purely lossy electric circuit. By designing alternating lossy electric circuit networks that correspond to the disclination lattice, we observe a voltage response localized at the disclination sites and demonstrate the robustness of these states against disorder. Furthermore, we measure the charge distribution, confirming the presence of fractional charge at the disclination sites, which gives rise to the topological disclination states. Our experiment provides direct evidence of gain-loss-induced topological disclination states in electric circuits, opening new possibilities for applications in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Hidden Potential in Electron Holography of Non-Collinear Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their particle-like properties, three-dimensional (3D) spin textures have garnered significant interest, particularly for their potential applications in next-generation information storage devices. However, efficiently identifying these textures remains a major challenge. Here, we approach this problem from a new perspective. Rather than relying solely on the magnetic stray field, which vanishes in antiferromagnets, we use multiple-scattering theory to demonstrate that spin textures carry nontrivial charges due to the noncollinearity of magnetic moments. This induced charge encodes magnetic information driven by spin-mixing and spin-orbit interactions. We propose leveraging electron holography to extract this information by reconstructing phase images obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To quantify this effect, we systematically calculate and compare the contributions of both conventional and newly identified mechanisms to the phase images, considering different electronic structure parameters. Our findings mark a significant milestone in advancing the exploration and possible application of 3D spin textures in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in hBN-encapsulated graphene based supermoir\'e structures and their experimental signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermoir\'e structures (SMS), formed by overlapping moir\'e-patterns in van der Waals heterostructures, display complex behaviour that lacks a comprehensive low-energy theoretical description. We demonstrate that these structures can form emergent fractals under specific conditions and identify the parameter space where this occurs in hexagonal trilateral SMS. This fractality enables a reliable calculation of low-energy band counts, which are crucial for understanding both single-particle and correlation effects. Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene. We prescribe methods to experimentally verify these fractals and extract their fractal dimension through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</description>

      <title>A few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by digitally modulated video signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators driven by multifrequency signals combine the physics of mesoscopic vibrations and the technologies of radio communication. Their simplest property stems from their resonant response: they behave as filters, responding only to driving signals whose frequency range is contained within that of the mechanical response. While the response is routinely probed with a single tone drive, a multifrequency drive offers the possibility of inducing richer vibrational dynamics. In this case, all the frequency components of the drive are simultaneously transduced into vibrations with different amplitudes and phases that superimpose and interfere. Here, we employ a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator as a filter for broadband, digitally modulated video signals. We transduce the modulated drive into modulated vibrations, which we demodulate into a nanomechanical video. Our work reveals distinctive features in vibrations driven by a coherent, multifrequency drive unseen in vibrations actuated by single tone drives or by a force noise.</description>

      <title>Deciphering competing interactions of Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ system in clusters: part II -- dynamics of Majorana fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic and exact study of Majorana fermion dynamics in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model in a few finite-size clusters increasing in size up to twelve sites. We employ exact Jordan-Wigner transformations to evaluate certain measures of Majorana fermion correlation functions, which effectively capture matter and gauge Majorana fermion dynamics in different parameter regimes. An external magnetic field is shown to produce a profound effect on gauge fermion dynamics. Depending on certain non-zero choices of other non-Kitaev interactions, it can stabilise it to its non-interacting Kitaev limit. For all the parameter regimes, gauge fermions are seen to have slower dynamics, which could help build approximate decoupling schemes for appropriate mean-field theory. The probability of Majorana fermions returning to their original starting site shows that the Kitaev model in small clusters can be used as a test bed for the quantum speed limit.</description>

      <title>ZrN nucleation layer provides backside ohmic contact to MBE-grown GaN nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single nanowire with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.</description>

      <title>Majorana sweet spots in 3-site Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains, composed of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor, have emerged as an attractive platform to realize Majorana bound states (MBSs). These excitations exist when the ground state is degenerate. The additional requirement of isolating the MBS wavefunctions further restricts the parameter space to discrete sweet spots. While scaling up to Kitaev chains with more than two sites has the potential to improve the stability of the MBSs, longer chains offer more features to optimize, including the MBS localization length and the excitation gap. In this work, we theoretically investigate 3-site Kitaev chains and show that there are three different types of sweet spots, obtained by maximizing distinct MBS properties: genuine 3-site sweet spots with well-localized MBSs at the ends, effective 2-site sweet spots, where the middle site acts as a barrier, and sweet spots with delocalized MBSs that overlap in the middle of the chain. These three cases feature different degrees of robustness against perturbations, with the genuine 3-site being the most stable. We analyze the energy spectrum, transport, and microwave absorption associated with these three cases, showing how to distinguish them.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric moment encodes stacking order of moir\'e matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moir\'e materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moir\'e materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA) and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and detection.</description>

In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Renormalization Group Flow at a Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a controlled numerical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling, providing evidence of the characteristic logarithmic finite-size scaling of the BKT transition. Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.</description>

      <title>Colossal magnetoresistance in a quasi-two-dimensional cluster glass semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a surge of interest in spintronics, the manipulation and detection of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional layered magnetic materials have become a key focus, driven by their relatively scarce occurrence compared to giant magnetoresistance and tunneling magnetoresistance. This study presents an investigation into the desired colossal magnetoresistance, achieved by introducing magnetic frustration through Te doping in quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet Cr2Se3 matrix. The resulting Cr0.98SeTe0.27 exhibits cluster glass-like behavior with a freezing temperature of 28 K. Magnetotransport studies reveal a significant negative magnetoresistance of up to 32%. Additionally, angle-dependent transport measurements demonstrate a magnetic field-induced transition from positive to negative resistance anisotropy, suggesting a magnetic field-driven alteration in the electronic structure of this narrow band gap semiconductor, a characteristic feature of the colossal magnetoresistance effect. This behavior is further corroborated by density functional theory calculations. This systematic investigation provides a crucial understanding of the control of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional materials via competing exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting MnSe : a Magnetic Semiconductor with Spin-Phonon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-phonon interactions in 2D magnetic materials are crucial in advancing next-generation spintronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials with significant spin-phonon interactions is of great importance. In this context, MnSe, previously recognized as an exemplary non-layered p-type semiconductor emerges in this study as an intriguing material with notable spin-phonon characteristics. The complex magnetism in pristine MnSe, primarily dominated by antiferromagnetism with a weak ferromagnetic component, gives rise to both spontaneous and conventional exchange bias effects at low temperatures. In an effort to understand this intriguing magnetism, we conducted a detailed Raman spectroscopy study, which reveals unconventional deviations from the usual phonon anharmonicity around Neel temperature (170 K), in the self-energies of the P1, P2, and P3 modes. Notably, the P1 mode is most sensitive to spin-phonon coupling, while the P2 mode is particularly responsive to the structural phase transition at 250 K. Therefore, these findings provide comprehensive insights into the phase transitions of pristine MnSe, particularly highlighting the previously unobserved interplay between its magnetic behavior and phonon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Nodal-Ring Phonons in Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological physics has evolved from its initial focus on fermionic systems to the exploration of bosonic systems, particularly phononic excitations in crystalline materials. Two-dimensional (2D) topological phonons emerge as promising candidates for future technological applications. Currently, experimental verification of 2D topological phonons has remained exclusively limited to graphene, a constraint that hinders their applications in phononic devices. Here, we report experimental evidence of topological phonons in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using advanced high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our high-precision measurements explicitly demonstrate two topological nodal rings in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, protected by mirror symmetry, expanding the paradigm of 2D topological phonons beyond graphene. This research not only deepens fundamental understanding of 2D topological phonons, but also establishes a phononic device platform based on wide-bandgap insulators, crucial for advancements in electronics and photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Exchange Coupling Modulation in MN4-Embedded Graphene Layers (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) Under Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, with transition metal elements M, are experimentally accessible two-dimensional (2D) materials and show great potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.</description>

      <title>Scalable Low-overhead Superconducting Non-local Coupler with Exponentially Enhanced Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum critical states with a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can determine rigorously these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, confirming the generalized mechanism. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</description>

      <title>Spatial mapping of intrinsic and readout nonlinearities in a strongly-driven micromechanical membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that strongly driven micromechanical resonators show mode shapes that strongly differ from the eigenmodes. This raises the question of the origin of this nonlinear behavior. We measure the spatial dependence of the nonlinearities of high-stress micromechanical membranes. The mechanical nonlinearity is determined from the frequency response and is found to be independent of the probing location. It is the phase of the response that is instrumental in extracting that intrinsic nonlinearity. Our interferometric readout results in high-harmonics generation. These harmonics have a clear spatial profile that shows ring-like patterns resembling previous reports. These patterns are reproduced by a model of the displacement-dependent reflection signal in combination with motion amplitudes of the same order as the probing wavelength.</description>

Abstract: Nanoscopic heterogeneities in composition and structure are quintessential for the properties of electrocatalyst materials. Here, we present a semiclassical model to study the electrochemical properties of supported electrocatalyst nanoparticles (NP). The model captures the correlated electronic and ionic equilibration across NP, support, and electrolyte. It reveals peculiar trends in surface charging of the supported NP, validated by comparison with first-principles calculations. Support-induced perturbations in electronic and ionic charge densities at the NP's active surface manifest as distinct potentials of zero local electronic and ionic charges that could differ by more than 0.5 V in the studied system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.</description>

      <title>Topological spin-torque diode effect in skyrmion-based magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing market and massive use of Internet of Things nodes is placing unprecedented demands of energy efficient hardware for edge computing and microwave devices. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), as main building blocks of spintronic microwave technology, can offer a path for the development of compact and high-performance microwave detectors. On the other hand, the fascinating field of skyrmionics is bridging together concepts from topology and spintronics. Here, we show the proof of concept of the direct electrical excitation and detection of the dynamics of a topological protected magnetic texture, i.e. skyrmion at room temperature and for a wide region of applied fields, including the zero field case. This topological spin torque diode is realized with an MTJ on top of a skyrmionic material. Quantitative Magnetic Force Microscopy measurements are employed to confirm the existence of a single skyrmion in the MTJ free layer. Spin torque diode electrical measurements show the electrical excitation via spin transfer torque (STT) of a skyrmion resonant mode with frequencies near 4 GHz and a selectivity one order of magnitude smaller than the uniform modes excited in the same device. Micromagnetic simulations identify these dynamics with the excitation of the breathing mode and point out the role of thickness dependent magnetic parameters (magnetic anisotropy field and Dzyaloshinkii Moriya interaction) in both stabilizing and exciting the magnetic skyrmions. This work marks a milestone for the development of topological spin torque diodes.</description>

Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree by deriving the analytical expression of multifractal dimensions. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials offers a promising platform for efficient control of magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based devices. However, energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and spin dynamics experiments to understand the basic SOT phenomena in all-2D vdW heterostructures are so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and tunable magnetization dynamics in a vdW heterostructure comprising out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 and topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We measured the non-linear second harmonic Hall signal in TaIrTe4 /Fe3GaTe2 devices to evaluate the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics, which is characterized by a large and tunable out-of-plane damping-like torque. Energy-efficient and deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching is achieved at room temperature with a very low current density. First-principles calculations unveil the origin of the unconventional charge-spin conversion phenomena, considering the crystal symmetry and electronic structure of TaIrTe4. These results establish that all-vdW heterostructures provide a promising route to energy-efficient, field-free, and tunable SOT-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electrical transport in a quantum wire of $N$ sites connected to an equal number $(N_i/2)$ of sources and drains of charges in bulk. Each source and drain injects and extracts charges at the same rate, respectively. We show that the linear-response electrical current is nonreciprocal in such a system when the arrangement of sources and drains breaks the system's parity. We prove that inelastic scattering is essential for nonreciprocity in this system. For this, we invoke a master equation description of classical charge transport in a similar system. The nonreciprocal current in quantum wire matches that in the classical model for $N_i/N \sim 1$, generating a finite scattering length much smaller than the length of the wire. The nonreciprocity in the quantum wire oscillates with wire length when $N_i/N \ll 1$, and it can vanish at specific lengths.</description>

      <title>Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Metallic collinear antiferromagnets with mirror-symmetric and asymmetric spin-splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically describe a distinct class of two-dimensional N\'{e}el ordered metallic antiferromagnets on a honeycomb-like lattice in which the two sublattices are connected only by a combination of time-reversal and mirror symmetry operations. As a result of this symmetry, conducting fermions have antiferromagnetic spin-splitting consistent with the symmetry, the mirror-symmetric spin-splitting. It is shown that the anomalous spin Hall effect is expected in such systems. We also consider a system in which there are no symmetries between the sublattices and obtain asymmetric spin-splitting. Such systems are expected to have the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Chirality-dependent Dynamics from Helicity-resolved Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubry-Andr\'e and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{\'e} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{\'e} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.</description>

      <title>High-chirality Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary master equation approach to the Anderson-Holstein impurity problem out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method based on auxiliary master equation for solving the problem of an impurity with local electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction embedded between two conduction leads with a finite bias voltage. The Anderson-Holstein Hamiltonian is transformed to a corresponding Lindblad equation with a reduced set of sites providing an optimal approximation of the hybridization function. The problem is solved in the superfermion representation using configuration interaction for fermions and bosons. The phonon basis is shifted and rotated with the intention of permitting a low phonon basis cutoff even in the strong-coupling regime. We benchmark this approach with the numerical renormalization group in equilibrium, finding excellent agreement. We observe, however, that the rotation brings no advantage beyond the bare shift. This is even more apparent out of equilibrium, where issues in convergence with respect to the size of the phononic Hilbert space occur only in the rotated basis. As an application of the method, we explore the evolution of the phononic peak in the differential conductance spectra with changing phonon frequency.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian generalized two-mode squeezing: applications to two-ensemble spin squeezing and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <title>Mott insulators appearing at thickness period corresponding to nesting in CaRuO_3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 {\AA} film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 {\AA} on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 {\AA} periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended $s$-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. Essentially the initial single band is divided into number of sub-bands. If the chemical potential lies inside the energy gaps (sub-bands) then the phase is topologically trivial (non trivial). This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. The emergence of sub-bands allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed. We also discuss how in-plane magnetic field can be used to control the RSOC coupling and induced periodicity in depleted InAs nanowire in which evidence of strong electron-electron correlation has been found.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast laser synthesis of zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>
