      <title>Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of long COVID in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents a major global pandemic of the 21st century, with long-term effects termed long COVID. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated pharmacological interventions for adults with long COVID, incorporating randomized controlled trials and adjusted observational studies. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation; secondary outcomes covered symptom recovery across five categories, with safety assessed via adverse events. Results from random-effects models showed that saline nasal irrigation (SMD=21.10, 95% CI [16.91, 25.30]), nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium (SMD=7.40 [5.79, 9.01]), tetra sodium pyrophosphate (SMD=3.69 [2.61, 4.77]), and sodium gluconate (SMD=3.01 [1.92, 4.09]) significantly improved anosmia versus control. For thrombosis, rivaroxaban reduced arterial (OR=0.33 [0.01, 8.19]) and venous thrombotic events (OR=0.12 [0.01, 0.97]), while therapeutic-dose anticoagulants lowered thrombotic risks but increased major bleeding events (OR=1.86 [1.19, 2.89]) compared to prophylactic dosing. This NMA provides comparative evidence to guide treatment strategies for long COVID, highlighting the need for further research as new evidence emerges.</description>

      <title>Modeling Age-Adjusted Mortality in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores how total mortality figures relate to age-standardized death rates within the United States, using the complete historical record of national mortality statistics. Through a detailed investigation of both all-cause and cause-specific mortality trends, the study evaluates the impact of demographic standardization on interpreting mortality data across different time periods and geographic regions. Results indicate a robust and persistent association between crude death totals and age-adjusted rates. However, the findings also demonstrate that without adjusting for age, comparisons over time or across locations may misrepresent underlying epidemiological shifts, largely due to evolving population age structures. The study underscores the critical role of age adjustment as a methodological tool for generating accurate, interpretable, and comparable measures of public health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Interaction Spaces Impose Geometric Constraints On Collective Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective organization in physical, biophysical, and biological systems often emerges from many weak, local interactions, yet the resulting global structures display striking regularities and apparent limits in diversity. Existing theoretical approaches typically emphasize specific mechanisms, detailed dynamics, or energetic optimization, making it difficult to identify constraints that are independent of microscopic realization. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that, when effective interactions among system components compress into a low-dimensional interaction space, global organization is governed by geometric constraints rather than detailed dynamics. We formalize interaction spaces as metric manifolds derived from coarse-grained effective couplings and show that low interaction dimensionality imposes upper bounds on the number, separability, and robustness of distinct collective organizations. These results yield impossibility statements: many conceivable macroscopic organizations are excluded a priori, even when locally compatible interactions exist. The framework applies across equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems without assuming specific symmetries or conservation laws. By shifting the explanatory focus from generative mechanisms to structural constraints, this work establishes a general, geometry-based perspective on collective organization.</description>

      <title>Component systems: do null models explain everything?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Component systems - ensembles of realizations built from a shared repertoire of modular parts - are ubiquitous in biological, ecological, technological, and socio-cultural domains. From genomes to texts, cities, and software, these systems exhibit statistical regularities that often meet the "bona fide" requirements of laws in the physical sciences. Here, we argue that the generality and simplicity of those laws are often due to basic combinatorial or sampling constraints, raising the question of whether such patterns are actually revealing system-specific mechanisms and how we might move beyond them. To this end, we first present a unifying mathematical framework, which allows us to compare modular systems in different fields and highlights the common "null" trends as well as the system-specific uniqueness, which, arguably, are signatures of the underlying generative dynamics. Next, we can exploit the framework with statistical mechanics and modern machine-learning tools for a twofold objective. (i) Explaining why the general regularities emerge, highlighting the constraints between them and the general principles at their origins, and (ii) "subtracting" them from data, which will isolate the informative features for inferring hidden system-specific generative processes, mechanistic and causal aspects.</description>

      <title>Development and Evaluation of a Standardized Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support to Improve Interoperability and Clinical Reasoning in Acute Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies to support respiration, often preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there remains a significant challenge to its optimal use across all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. This study introduced NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity and interoperability, laying the groundwork for future clinical decision-making. We developed NIRS ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding a sample of 6 patient scenarios and used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. The ontology has 145 classes, 11 object properties, and 18 data properties across 949 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 392 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL query evaluations across clinical scenarios confirmed the ontology ability to support rulebased reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes. In conclusion, we unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.</description>
