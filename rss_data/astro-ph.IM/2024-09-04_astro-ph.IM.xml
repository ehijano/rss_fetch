      <title>A Broadband Multipole Method for Accelerated Mutual Coupling Analysis of Large Irregular Arrays Including Rotated Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the analysis of mutual coupling effects in large, dense and irregular arrays with identical antennas. Building on the Method of Moments (MoM), our technique employs a Macro Basis Function (MBF) approach for rapid direct inversion of the MoM impedance matrix. To expedite the reduced matrix filling, we propose an extension of the Steepest-Descent Multipole expansion which remains numerically stable and efficient across a wide bandwidth. This broadband multipole-based approach is well suited to quasi-planar problems and requires only the pre-computation of each MBF's complex patterns, resulting in low antenna-dependent pre-processing costs. The method also supports arrays with arbitrarily rotated antennas at low additional cost. A simulation of all embedded element patterns of irregular arrays of 256 complex log-periodic antennas completes in just 10 minutes per frequency point on a current laptop, with an additional minute per new layout.</description>

      <title>squishyplanet: Modeling Transits of Non-spherical Exoplanets in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While astronomers often assume that exoplanets are perfect spheres when analyzing observations, the subset of these distant worlds that are subject to strong tidal forces and/or rapid rotations are expected to be distinctly ellipsoidal or even triaxial. Since a planet's response to these forces is determined in part by its interior structure, measurements of an exoplanet's deviations from spherical symmetry can lead to powerful insights into its composition and surrounding environment. These shape deformations will imprint themselves on a planet's phase curve and transit lightcurve and cause small (1s-100s of parts per million) deviations from their spherical-planet counterparts. Until recently, these deviations were undetectable in typical real-world datasets due to limitations in photometric precision. Now, however, current and soon-to-come-online facilities such as JWST will routinely deliver observations that warrant the consideration of more complex models. To this end we present squishyplanet, a JAX-based Python package that implements an extension of the polynomial limb-darkened transit model presented in Agol et al. 2020 to non-spherical (triaxial) planets, as well as routines for modeling reflection and emission phase curves.</description>

      <title>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: A Comprehensive Spectroscopic Survey of Transiting &amp; High-Contrast Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a comprehensive survey of giant planets ranging from close-in highly irradiated hot Jupiters to young, wide-orbit directly imaged planets. The combination of two established techniques for probing planetary atmospheric compositions (time-series transit observations and high-contrast spectroscopy) will provide an unprecedented window into gaseous planet compositions across a range of equilibrium temperatures (100-2000 K), orbital separations (0.1-100 au), and system ages (10 Myr-1 Gyr). To-date, compositional measurements of both transiting and directly imaged planets suggest two distinct formation pathways: star-like formation for directly imaged planets and planet-like formation for transiting planets. By leveraging the combined technical and theoretical expertise of the transiting and direct imaging communities, we can obtain a holistic view of giant planet formation, migration, accretion, and evolution. From the results of this comprehensive program, we will begin to answer one of the fundamental outstanding questions in our understanding of giant planets: where and how in the protoplanetary disk do giant planets form?</description>

      <title>Golden Spiral Interferometry for Radio Astronomy. A proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio interferometry is a powerful technique that allows astronomers to create high-resolution images of astronomical objects. The distribution of radio telescopes in an interferometer is a critical factor that determines the resolution and sensitivity of the instrument. Traditionally, radio telescopes are distributed in a linear or circular array. However, recent work has shown that using a golden spiral distribution can improve the resolution and sensitivity of an interferometer. In this paper, the author proposes the use of a golden spiral distribution for radio interferometry, showing that a golden spiral distribution can provide a significant improvement in resolution, up to a factor of eight, compared to a linear or circular distribution. The author also proposes that a golden spiral distribution can improve the sensitivity of an interferometer; it may provide a more uniform distribution of radio telescopes than a linear or circular distribution (a known propety of spiral distributions).</description>

      <title>The HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) Pathfinder mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) Pathfinder is a space-borne mission based on a constellation of six nano-satellites flying in a low-Earth orbit (LEO). The 3U CubeSats, to be launched in early 2025, host miniaturized instruments with a hybrid Silicon Drift Detector/GAGG:Ce scintillator photodetector system, sensitive to X-rays and gamma-rays in a large energy band. HERMES will operate in conjunction with Australian Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) 6U CubeSat, launched in December 2023. HERMES will probe the temporal emission of bright high-energy transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), ensuring a fast transient localization in a field of view of several steradians exploiting the triangulation technique. HERMES intrinsically modular transient monitoring experiment represents a keystone capability to complement the next generation of gravitational wave experiments. In this paper we outline the scientific case, development and programmatic status of the mission</description>

      <title>Development of an Autonomous Detection-Unit Self-Trigger for GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges for the radio detection of extensive air showers, as encountered by the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), is the requirement of an autonomous radio self-trigger. This work presents the current development of self-triggering techniques at the detection-unit level -- the so-called first-level trigger (FLT) -- in the context of the NUTRIG project. A second-level trigger (SLT) at the array level is described in a separate contribution. Two FLT methods are described, based on a template-fitting algorithm and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we compare the preliminary offline performance of both FLT methods in terms of signal selection efficiency and background rejection efficiency. We find that for both methods, ${\gtrsim}40\%$ of the background can be rejected if a signal selection efficiency of 90\% is required at the $5\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Spectrophotometric accuracy of spectra obtained from spectroscopic plates measured with a commercial flatbed scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensity spectra recovered from the spectroscopic photographic plates were compared with the CCD spectra, and we found the difference between the two was 2.5%.The measurements were taken using a commercial flatbed scanner instead of a microdensitometer. The results indicate that the following two statements are inaccurate: (1) Correct measurement of spectroscopic plates requires a microdensitometer, and a commercial flatbed scanner is insufficient; (2) The spectrophotometric accuracy of spectroscopic plate is approximately 10% accurate. These results will encourage the creation and publication of a digital archive of spectroscopic plates. This paper presents the measurement of spectroscopic plates, the method of recovering intensity spectra from photographic density spectra, the results of comparison with CCD spectra, and discusses the causes of the high accuracy spectra obtained with a commercial flatbed scanner.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: design and performance of the Focal Plane Mechanism prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MICADO is a first-generation instrument for the ELT. It will provide diffraction-limited imaging in standard, astrometric, and coronagraphic modes and long-slit spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths. The core of the MICADO instrument is its cryostat, which cools the internal optical and mechanical subsystems to 80 K. Following a light ray entering the cryostat through the entrance window, the first mechanism it encounters is the Focal Plane Mechanism. It consists of two independent movable devices mounted in one assembly: the aperture wheel and the focal plane wheel. The primary purpose of the aperture wheel is to rapidly block the light path, which is needed to mitigate persistence on the detectors. The focal plane wheel holds field stops, calibration masks, slits, and coronagraphs. The positioning requirements for the wheel are dominated by the coronographic masks demanding a 15 $\mu$m RMS repeatability. To fulfill this specification and avoid mechanical wear in the drive, a novel magnetically coupled gear system was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE). A magnetically coupled worm gear uses magnetic forces to transmit torque from the motor to the driven component without direct mechanical contact. This paper describes the design and performance of the magnetic drive and the first results of the focal plane wheel prototype tests in a cryogenic environment.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the Atmosphere in Very High Energy Gamma-Astronomy for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based observations of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays from extreme astrophysical sources are significantly influenced by atmospheric conditions. This is due to the atmosphere being an integral part of the detector when utilizing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Clouds and dust particles diminish atmospheric transmission of Cherenkov light, thereby impacting the reconstruction of the air showers and consequently the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra. Precise measurements of atmospheric transmission above Cherenkov observatories play a pivotal role in the accuracy of the analysed data, among which the corrections of the reconstructed energies and fluxes of incoming gamma rays, and in establishing observation strategies for different types of gamma-ray emitting sources. The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), both located on the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM), La Palma, Canary Islands, use different sets of auxiliary instruments for real-time characterisation of the atmosphere. In this paper, historical data taken by MAGIC LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) and CTAO FRAM (F/Photometric Robotic Telescope) are presented. From the atmospheric aerosol transmission profiles measured by the MAGIC LIDAR and CTAO FRAM aerosol optical depth maps, we obtain the characterisation of the clouds above the ORM at La Palma needed for data correction and optimal observation scheduling.</description>

      <title>Italian Spring Accelerometer measurements of unexpected Non Gravitational Perturbation during BepiColombo second Venus swing-by</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA) is a three axis mass-spring accelerometer, one of the payloads of the BepiColombo joint space mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). At launch in October 2018, BepiColombo started its seven-year cruise as a stack of three different modules, overall named Mercury Composite Spacecraft (MCS). The spacecraft will provide BepiColombo the necessary Delta V to reach Mercury with its electric thrusters and along with one, two and six gravity assists, respectively with Earth, Venus and Mercury. The accelerometer is accommodated on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) module and, jointly with the Ka-band Transponder (KaT) tracking data, will primarily serve the BepiColombo Radio Science Experiment (BC-RSE). During the second Venus swing-by, strong tidal effect and external perturbations was expected to act on the spacecraft and to become detectable by ISA. The swing-by had a closest approach of about 550 km and the gravity gradient expected on the IDA sensing elements was perfectly measured. Hence, in this paper, the first direct Gravity Gradient effect detection generated by an extraterrestrial body is shown. Nevertheless, around the closest approach, the measurements evidenced a spurious acceleration event lasting for several minutes. This work, exploiting information on the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) commanded torques, focuses and analyses this ISA acceleration signal, ascribing it to a net force really acting on the MCS spacecraft. Furthermore, using an estimation method, the application point of the force is confined to an area close to the MPO radiator.</description>

      <title>Targeting 100-PeV tau neutrino detection with an array of phased and high-gain reconstruction antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos at ultrahigh energies can originate both from interactions of cosmic rays at their acceleration sites and through cosmic-ray interactions as they propagate through the universe. These neutrinos are expected to have a low flux which drives the need for instruments with large effective areas. Radio observations of the inclined air showers induced by tau neutrino interactions in rock can achieve this, because radio waves can propagate essentially unattenuated through the hundreds of kilometers of atmosphere. Proposed arrays for radio detection of tau neutrinos focus on either arrays of inexpensive receivers distributed over a large area, the GRAND concept, or compact phased arrays on elevated mountains, the BEACON concept, to build up a large detector area with a low trigger threshold. We present a concept that combines the advantages of these two approaches with a trigger driven by phased arrays at a moderate altitude (1 km) and sparse, high-gain outrigger receivers for reconstruction and background rejection. We show that this design has enhanced sensitivity at 100 PeV over the two prior designs with fewer required antennas and discuss the need for optimized antenna designs.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere. I. Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE experiment onboard Chandayaan-3 lander</title>

Abstract: Chandra Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) is one of the payloads flown onboard the Chandrayaan-3 lander. The objective of the experiment is in-situ investigation of thermal behaviour of outermost 100 mm layer of the lunar surface by deploying a thermal probe. The probe consists of 10 temperature sensors (Platinum RTDs) mounted at different locations along the length of the probe to measure lunar soil temperatures as a function of depth. A heater is also mounted on the probe for thermal conductivity measurements. The onboard electronics of ChaSTE has two parts, Front-End Electronics (FEE) and processing electronics (PE). The front-end electronics (FEE) card is responsible for carrying out necessary sensor signal conditioning,which includes exciting the RTD sensors,acquiring analog voltages and then converting the acquired analog signals to digital signals using an Analog to Digital Converter(ADC). The front-end card is further interfaced with the processing electronics card for digital processing and spacecraft interface.The calibration, characterisation and functional test activities of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE were carried out with the objective of testing and ensuring proper functionality and performance.A two phase calibration process involving electronic offset correction and temperature calibration were carried out. All these activities were successfully completed and the results from them provided us with a really good understanding of the behaviour of the FEE under different thermal and electrical conditions as well as when subjected to the simulated conditions of the actual ChaSTE experiment. The performance of the ChaSTE front-end electronics was very much within the design margins and its behaviour in simulated lunar environment was as desired. The data from these activities is useful in the interpretation of the actual science data of ChaSTE.</description>

      <title>ASTRODEEP-JWST: NIRCam-HST multiband photometry and redshifts for half a million sources in six extragalactic deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of $\sim$0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 $\mu$m. A grand total of $\sim$530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 $\mu$m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Accretion Disk Reflection Model: High-Density Plasma Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous accretion disks around black holes are expected to have densities of $\sim 10^{15-22}\,$cm$^{-3}$, which are high enough such that plasma physics effects become important. Many of these effects have been traditionally neglected in the calculation of atomic parameters, and therefore from photoionization models, and ultimately also from X-ray reflection models. In this paper, we describe updates to the atomic rates used by the XSTAR code, which is in turn part of the XILLVER disk reflection model. We discuss the effect of adding necessary high density corrections into the XILLVER code. Specifically, we find that the change of recombination rates play an important role, dominating the differences between model versions. With synthetic spectra, we show that even in a highly ionized state, high density slabs can produce strong iron ($\sim$6.5-9$\,$keV) and oxygen ($\sim0.6-0.8\,$keV) resonance features. The significant iron emission could address the problem of the supersolar iron abundances found in some sources.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo calculations of cryogenic photodetector readout of scintillating GaAs for dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery that GaAs(Si,B) is a bright cryogenic scintillator with no apparent afterglow offers new opportunities for detecting rare, low-energy, electronic excitations from interacting dark matter. This paper presents Monte Carlo calculations of the scintillation photon detection efficiencies of optical cavities using three current cryogenic photodetector technologies. In order of photon detection efficiency these are: (1) Ge/TES: germanium absorbers that convert interacting photons to athermal phonons that are readout by transition edge sensors, (2) KID: kinetic induction detectors that respond to the breaking of cooper pairs by a change in resonance frequency, and (3) SNSPD: superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, where a photon briefly transitions a thin wire from superconducting to normal. The detection efficiencies depend strongly on the n-type GaAs absolute absorption coefficient KA, which is a part of the narrow beam absorption that has never been directly measured. However, the high cryogenic scintillation luminosity of GaAs(Si,B) sets an upper limit on KA of 0.03/cm. Using that value and properties published for Ge/TES, KID, and SNSPD photodetectors, this work calculates that those photodetectors attached to opposing faces of a 1 cm3 cubic GaAs(Si,B) crystal in an optical cavity with gold mirrors would have scintillation photon detection efficiencies of 35%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. Larger values would be expected for lower values of KA.</description>

      <title>Imaging the black hole shadow and extended jet of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy M87 is one of the prime targets for high resolution radio imaging pursuing the ringlike shadow of its supermassive black hole, the innermost regions of accretion flow, and the formation of the relativistic jet. However, it remains challenging to observe both jointly. Only recently, global mm-VLBI array (GMVA)+ALMA observations at 86 GHz in 2018 were able to reconstruct the M87 black hole shadow and the extended jet emission simultaneously. In order to analyze the ring and jet of M87, conventional CLEAN algorithms were mainly employed alongside the RML method SMILI in the previous work. To test the robustness of the reconstructed structures of M87 GMVA+ALMA observations at 86GHz, we estimate the ring diameter, width, and the extended jet emission with the possible central spine by two different novel imaging algorithms: resolve and DoG-HiT. Overall reconstructions are consistent with the results reported in the previous paper. The ring structure of the M87 is resolved at higher resolution and the posterior distribution of M87 ring features is explored. The resolve images show that the ring diameter is 60.9 +- 2.2 muas and width is 16.0 +- 0.9 muas. The ring diameter is 61.0 muas and width is 20.6 muas by DoG-HiT. The ring diameter is therefore in agreement with the estimation (64+4-8 muas) by SMILI and the geometrical modeling. Two bright spots in the ring are reconstructed by four independent imaging methods, the substructure in the ring is therefore most likely originated from the data. A consistent limb-brightened jet structure is reconstructed by resolve and DoG-HiT, albeit with a less pronounced central spine. Modern data-driven imaging methods confirm the ring and jet structure in M87, complementing traditional VLBI methods with novel perspectives on the significance of recovered features. They confirm the result of the previous report.</description>

Abstract: The next-generation neutrino telescope IceCube-Gen2 is planned to include a surface detector array consisting of scintillation detectors and radio antennas for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers. Prototype stations, each comprising 8 scintillator panels and 3 SKALA antennas, have been deployed to various locations. One of these stations is located at the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, situated within the most densely instrumented part of the surface detector array, which features a spacing of 433 meters. In this contribution, we present first results from this prototype station, including the observation of the Galactic noise, and the first coincident detection of air showers between the prototype radio antennas and the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detection is based on the astrodynamical equations derived from gravitational theory to detect changes in distance between spacecraft/celestial bodies and/or their state changes caused by gravitational waves. The fundamental method involves using electromagnetic waves (including radio waves, microwaves, light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) for Doppler tracking and comparing to the stable frequency standards (sources) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. Examples include microwave Doppler tracking, optical clock gravitational wave detection, atom interferometry gravitational wave detection, and laser interferometry gravitational wave detection. If the frequency sources at both ends are not sufficiently stable, a generalized dual-path Michelson interferometer based on Doppler tracking combinations is needed. Currently, the main space-based gravitational wave detectors under construction or planning are laser interferometers, which cover medium frequency (0.1-10 Hz) and low-frequency (millihertz 0.1-100 mHz and microhertz 0.1-100 {\mu}Hz) gravitational wave detection bands. This article reviews the current status and prospects of these gravitational wave detection methods.</description>

      <title>Why heterogeneous cloud particles matter: Iron-bearing species and cloud particle morphology affects exoplanet transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of observing spectral features in exoplanet atmospheres with space missions like JWST and ARIEL necessitates the accurate modelling of cloud particle opacities. In exoplanet atmospheres, cloud particles can be made from multiple materials and be considerably chemically heterogeneous. Therefore, assumptions on the morphology of cloud particles are required to calculate their opacities. The aim of this work is to analyse how different approaches to calculate the opacities of heterogeneous cloud particles affect cloud particle optical properties. We calculate cloud particle optical properties using seven different mixing treatments: four effective medium theories (EMTs: Bruggeman, Landau-Lifshitz-Looyenga (LLL), Maxwell-Garnett, and Linear), core-shell, and two homogeneous cloud particle approximations. We study the mixing behaviour of 21 commonly considered cloud particle materials for exoplanets. To analyse the impact on observations, we study the transmission spectra of HATS-6b, WASP-39b, WASP-76b, and WASP-107b.Materials with large refractive indices, like iron-bearing species or carbon, can change the optical properties of cloud particles when they comprise less than 1\% of the total particle volume. The mixing treatment of heterogeneous cloud particles also has an observable effect on transmission spectroscopy. Assuming core-shell or homogeneous cloud particles results in less muting of molecular features and retains the cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials. The predicted transit depth for core-shell and homogeneous cloud particle materials are similar for all planets used in this work. If EMTs are used, cloud spectral features are broader and cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials are not retained. Using LLL leads to less molecular features in transmission spectra compared to Bruggeman.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Signatures of Core Magnetism and Rotation in Hundreds of Low-Luminosity Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red Giant stars host solar-like oscillations which have mixed character, being sensitive to conditions both in the outer convection zone and deep within the interior. The properties of these modes are sensitive to both core rotation and magnetic fields. While asteroseismic studies of the former have been done on a large scale, studies of the latter are currently limited to tens of stars. We aim to produce the first large catalogue of both magnetic and rotational perturbations. We jointly constrain these parameters by devising an automated method for fitting the power spectra directly. We successfully apply the method to 302 low-luminosity red giants. We find a clear bimodality in core rotation rate. The primary peak is at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.32 $\mu$Hz, and the secondary at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.47 $\mu$Hz. Combining our results with literature values, we find that the percentage of stars rotating much more rapidly than the population average increases with evolutionary state. We measure magnetic splittings of 2$\sigma$ significance in 23 stars. While the most extreme magnetic splitting values appear in stars with masses &gt; 1.1M$_{\odot}$, implying they formerly hosted a convective core, a small but statistically significant magnetic splitting is measured at lower masses. Asymmetry between the frequencies of a rotationally split multiplet has previously been used to diagnose the presence of a magnetic perturbation. We find that of the stars with a significant detection of magnetic perturbation, 43\% do not show strong asymmetry. We find no strong evidence of correlation between the rotation and magnetic parameters.</description>

      <title>AstroMAE: Redshift Prediction Using a Masked Autoencoder with a Novel Fine-Tuning Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Redshift prediction is a fundamental task in astronomy, essential for understanding the expansion of the universe and determining the distances of astronomical objects. Accurate redshift prediction plays a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of the cosmos. Machine learning (ML) methods, renowned for their precision and speed, offer promising solutions for this complex task. However, traditional ML algorithms heavily depend on labeled data and task-specific feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AstroMAE, an innovative approach that pretrains a vision transformer encoder using a masked autoencoder method on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. This technique enables the encoder to capture the global patterns within the data without relying on labels. To the best of our knowledge, AstroMAE represents the first application of a masked autoencoder to astronomical data. By ignoring labels during the pretraining phase, the encoder gathers a general understanding of the data. The pretrained encoder is subsequently fine-tuned within a specialized architecture tailored for redshift prediction. We evaluate our model against various vision transformer architectures and CNN-based models, demonstrating the superior performance of AstroMAEs pretrained model and fine-tuning architecture.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Catalog of UVIT Observations I: Catalog Description and First Release of Source Catalog (UVIT DR1)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive source catalog (UVIT DR1) of ultraviolet (UV) photometry in four far-UV (FUV $\sim$1300$-$1800 \AA) and five near-UV (NUV $\sim$2000$-$3000 \AA) filters of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board {\em AstroSat}. UVIT DR1 includes bright UV sources in 291 fields that UVIT detected during its first two years of pointed observation, encompassing an area of 58 square degrees. We used the {\sc ccdlab} pipeline to reduce the L1 data, source-extractor for source detection, and four photometric procedures to determine the magnitudes of the detected sources. We provided the 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ detection limits for all the filters of UVIT. We describe the details of observation, source extraction methods, and photometry procedures applied to prepare the catalog. In the final UVIT DR1 catalog, we have point sources, extended sources, clumps from nearby galaxies, There are 239,520 unique sources in the combined UVIT DR1, of which 70,488 sources have FUV magnitudes, and 211,410 have NUV magnitudes. We cross-matched and compared non-crowded sources of UVIT with the {\em Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)} and {\em Gaia} source catalogs. We provide a clean catalog of the unique sources in various UVIT filters that will help further multi-wavelength scientific analysis of the objects.</description>

Abstract: The search for biosignatures in potentially habitable exoplanets is one of the major astrophysics' drivers for the coming decades, and the prime science goal of the HWO NASA mission, a large UV-Optical-IR space telescope to be launched in the 2040s. To reach this goal, it will be equipped with state-of-the-art high-contrast spectro-imaging capabilities enabling the detection of exoplanets 10^10 times fainter than their host stars, a formidable challenge given today's best detection limits at ~10^-6 contrast levels. This goal puts stringent constraints on the entire observatory, and demands the optimization at the system level to leverage the performance of individual sub-systems. However, while image processing techniques are a key asset to reach the ultimate performance, the science and technological definition of the mission concepts mostly rely on the coronagraph and wavefront control to reject the starlight, assuming a conservative gain of ~10 in sensitivity from image processing, extrapolated from performance obtained with classical techniques on Hubble observations. In the ESCAPE project, we investigate integrated solutions for optimizing the observing methods and data processing techniques with future space telescopes, making use of their wavefront sensors and deformable mirrors. The Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, will be a critical milestone to demonstrate key technologies ahead of HWO with the Coronagraph instrument, and is thus a unique opportunity to also test and validate innovative image processing techniques. Here we present the rational, methodology, and timeline of the ESCAPE project.</description>

      <title>Multi-Amplifier Sensing Charge-coupled Devices for Next Generation Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present characterization results and performance of a prototype Multiple-Amplifier Sensing (MAS) silicon charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor with 16 channels potentially suitable for faint object astronomical spectroscopy and low-signal, photon-limited imaging. The MAS CCD is designed to reach sub-electron readout noise by repeatedly measuring charge through a line of amplifiers during the serial transfer shifts. Using synchronized readout electronics based on the DESI CCD controller, we report a read noise of 1.03 e$^-$ rms/pix at a speed of 26 $\mu$s/pix with a single-sample readout scheme where charge in a pixel is measured only once for each output stage. At these operating parameters, we find the amplifier-to-amplifier charge transfer efficiency (ACTE) to be $&gt;0.9995$ at low counts for all amplifiers but one for which the ACTE is 0.997. This charge transfer efficiency falls above 50,000 electrons for the read-noise optimized voltage configuration we chose for the serial clocks and gates. The amplifier linearity across a broad dynamic range from $\sim$300 to 35,000 e$^-$ was also measured to be $\pm 2.5\%$. We describe key operating parameters to optimize on these characteristics and describe the specific applications for which the MAS CCD may be a suitable detector candidate.</description>

      <title>HiFAST : An HI Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline for FAST II. Flux Density Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate flux density calibration is essential for precise analysis and interpretation of observations across different observation modes and instruments. In this research, we firstly introduce the flux calibration model incorporated in HIFAST pipeline, designed for processing HI 21-cm spectra. Furthermore, we investigate different calibration techniques and assess the dependence of the gain parameter on the time and environmental factors. A comparison is carried out in various observation modes (e.g. tracking and scanning modes) to determine the flux density gain ($G$), revealing insignificant discrepancies in $G$ among different methods. Long-term monitoring data shows a linear correlation between $G$ and atmospheric temperature. After subtracting the $G$--Temperature dependence, the dispersion of $G$ is reduced to $&lt;$3% over a one-year time scale. The stability of the receiver response of FAST is considered sufficient to facilitate HI observations that can accommodate a moderate error in flux calibration (e.g., $&gt;\sim5\%$) when utilizing a constant $G$ for calibration purposes. Our study will serve as a useful addition to the results provided by Jiang et al. (2020). Detailed measurement of $G$ for the 19 beams of FAST, covering the frequency range 1000 MHz -- 1500 MHz can be found on the HIFAST homepage: https://hifast.readthedocs.io/fluxgain.</description>

      <title>The UK Submillimetre and Millimetre Astronomy Roadmap 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Roadmap, we present a vision for the future of submillimetre and millimetre astronomy in the United Kingdom over the next decade and beyond. This Roadmap has been developed in response to the recommendation of the Astronomy Advisory Panel (AAP) of the STFC in the AAP Astronomy Roadmap 2022. In order to develop our stragetic priorities and recommendations, we surveyed the UK submillimetre and millimetre community to determine their key priorities for both the near-term and long-term future of the field. We further performed detailed reviews of UK leadership in submillimetre/millimetre science and instrumentation. Our key strategic priorities are as follows: 1. The UK must be a key partner in the forthcoming AtLAST telescope, for which it is essential that the UK remains a key partner in the JCMT in the intermediate term. 2. The UK must maintain, and if possible enhance, access to ALMA and aim to lead parts of instrument development for ALMA2040. Our strategic priorities complement one another: AtLAST (a 50m single-dish telescope) and an upgraded ALMA (a large configurable interferometric array) would be in synergy, not competition, with one another. Both have identified and are working towards the same overarching science goals, and both are required in order to fully address these goals.</description>

      <title>Unsigned magnetic flux proxy from solar optical intensity spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photospheric unsigned magnetic flux has been shown to be highly correlated with radial velocity (RV) variations caused by solar surface activity. This activity indicator is therefore a prime candidate to unlock the potential of RV surveys to discover Earth twins orbiting Sun-like stars. We show for the first time how a precise proxy of the unsigned magnetic flux ($\Delta\alpha B^2$) can be obtained from Sun-as-a-star intensity spectra by harnessing the magnetic information contained in over 4000 absorption lines in the wavelength range from 380 to 690 nm. This novel activity proxy can thus be obtained from the same spectra from which RVs are routinely extracted. We derived $\Delta\alpha B^2$ from 500 randomly selected spectra from the HARPS-N public solar data set, which spans from 2015 to 2018. We compared our estimates with the unsigned magnetic flux values from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) finding excellent agreement (median absolute deviation: 4.9 per cent). The extracted indicator $\Delta\alpha B^2$ correlates with SDO's unsigned magnetic flux estimates on the solar rotational timescale (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.67) and on the three-year timescale of our data set (correlation coefficient 0.91). We find correlations of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the HARPS-N solar RV variations of 0.49 on the rotational timescale and 0.78 on the three-year timescale. The Pearson correlation of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the RVs is found to be greater than the correlation of the classical activity indicators with the RVs. For solar-type stars, $\Delta\alpha B^2$ therefore represents the best simultaneous activity proxy known to date.</description>

      <title>Physics simulation capabilities of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged abstract] Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some undergraduate-level to graduate-level physics textbook problems and are proficient at coding. Combining these two capabilities could one day enable AI systems to simulate and predict the physical world.
  We present an evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on PhD-level to research-level computational physics problems. We condition LLM generation on the use of well-documented and widely-used packages to elicit coding capabilities in the physics and astrophysics domains. We contribute $\sim 50$ original and challenging problems in celestial mechanics (with REBOUND), stellar physics (with MESA), 1D fluid dynamics (with Dedalus) and non-linear dynamics (with SciPy). Since our problems do not admit unique solutions, we evaluate LLM performance on several soft metrics: counts of lines that contain different types of errors (coding, physics, necessity and sufficiency) as well as a more "educational" Pass-Fail metric focused on capturing the salient physical ingredients of the problem at hand.
  As expected, today's SOTA LLM (GPT4) zero-shot fails most of our problems, although about 40\% of the solutions could plausibly get a passing grade. About $70-90 \%$ of the code lines produced are necessary, sufficient and correct (coding \&amp; physics). Physics and coding errors are the most common, with some unnecessary or insufficient lines. We observe significant variations across problem class and difficulty. We identify several failure modes of GPT4 in the computational physics domain.
  Our reconnaissance work provides a snapshot of current computational capabilities in classical physics and points to obvious improvement targets if AI systems are ever to reach a basic level of autonomy in physics simulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Understanding spectral artefacts in SKA-LOW 21-cm cosmology experiments: the impact of cable reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Dawn was marked by the formation of the first stars, and preceded the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the Universe underwent a fundamental transformation caused by the radiation from these first stars and galaxies. Interferometric 21-cm experiments aim to probe redshifted neutral hydrogen signals from these periods, constraining the conditions of the early Universe. The SKA-Low instrument of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is envisaged to be the largest and most sensitive radio telescope at metre and centimetre wavelengths. The latest Aperture Array Verification Systems feature 7-m coaxial transmission lines connecting the low noise amplifiers to optical transmitters at the front of the analogue-receiving chain. An impedance mismatch between these components results in a partially reflected electromagnetic signal, introducing chromatic aberrations into the instrument bandpass. This causes power from the foreground signals to appear at higher delays, potentially contaminating the 'EoR window', a region in which the 21-cm signal should be detectable. We present an end-to-end simulation pipeline for SKA-Low using a composite sky model combining radio foregrounds from the Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, Haslam $408\,$MHz, and a 1.5-cGpc 21-cm brightness temperature cube generated with the 21cmSPACE simulator. We derive a model for the scattering parameters of a coaxial transmission line in terms of its specifications and bulk material properties. Assuming identical cables of length $\leq 15.0\,$m with impedance mismatch $\leq 10\, \Omega$, the reflection is confined below the EoR window. However, we demonstrate that even a 0.1 per cent length tolerance introduces contamination with an absolute fractional difference of $\sim 10$ per cent across all accessible k-modes.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: impact of bandpass, polarization angle and calibration uncertainties on small-scale power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions about the values of all the systematics examined here can have significant effects on cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at the likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pressurized Helium-4 (PHe) based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a PHe detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Additionally, the simulation analyses, conducted using GEANT4, provide detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity. IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of highly inclined extensive air showers in GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.</description>
