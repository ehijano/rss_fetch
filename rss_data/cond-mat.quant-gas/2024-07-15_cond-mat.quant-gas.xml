      <title>Rotating dipole and quadrupole quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs) are self-trapped modes stabilized by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field Hamiltonian of binary atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. The existence and stability of quiescent and rotating dipole-shaped and vortex QDs with vorticity $S=1$ (DQDs and VQDs, respectively) are numerically studied in the framework of the accordingly modified two-component system. The rotating DQDs trapped in an annular potential are built of two crescent-like components, stretching along the azimuthal direction with the increase of the rotation frequency. Rotating quadrupole QDs (QQDs) bifurcate from the VQDs with $S=2$. Above a certain rotation frequency, they transform back into VQDs with a flat-top shape. Rotating DQDs and QQDs are stable in a broad interval of values of the chemical potential. The results provide the first example of stable modes which are intermediate states between the rotating DQDs and QQDs on the one hand, and VQDs on the other.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics and atom-pair coherence in strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical treatments of non-equilibrium dynamics in strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures are complicated by the inherent non-Gaussian nature of the vacuum two-body physics, invalidating the typical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Here, we apply the cumulant expansion to study non-equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixtures, which allows us to explicitly include the missing non-Gaussian quantum correlations, leading to a consistent dynamical theory of a Bose-Fermi mixture near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. We first apply our theory to a study of atom-pair coherence in the gas, which is significantly enhanced by the competing influences of the Fermi sea and Bose-Einstein condensation, in agreement with analytical calculations. Then, we study the depletion of a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture following a quench to the unitary regime, characterizing the resulting depletion of the Bose-Einstein condensate, the deformation of the Fermi surface, and the production of molecules. We find that at early times, the population dynamics scale quadratically with the hold time, and define an associated characteristic timescale set by the parameters of the mixture and the width of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Localized States in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates: To be or not to be of second order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of localized states in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates confined to a tubular geometry. We first perform a bifurcation analysis to track their emergence in a one-dimensional domain for numerical feasibility and find that localized states can become the ground state in suitable parameter regions. Their existence for parameters featuring a supercritical primary bifurcation shows that the latter is not sufficient to conclude that the phase transition is of second order, hence density modulations can jump rather than emerging gradually. Finally, we show that localized states also exist in a three-dimensional domain.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of subradiance, marked by its surprising suppression of spontaneous emission, challenges conventional expectations of the collective behavior of scatterers. We study subradiance in the experimental setting of a Bose-Einstein condensate positioned at the mode crossing of two optical cavities. In this setup, subradiance manifests in the form of metastable density structures that suppress emission into one cavity mode, thereby preventing relaxation to the stationary, superradiant grating that minimizes the system's energy. We observe lifetimes of the subradiant states exceeding hundred milliseconds, far surpassing any characteristic dynamic time scale of the system. Eventually, an instability triggers a rapid transition to the superradiant stationary pattern. We reproduce these dynamics by a quantum mean field model, suggesting that subradiance shares characteristics with quasi-stationary states predicted in other long-range interacting systems such as astrophysical clusters and plasmas. This behavior highlights the potential of photon-mediated long-range forces as controllable and exploitable quantum cooperative phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dipolar droplets of strongly interacting molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09391v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the strongly dipolar regime, observing the existence of self-bound droplets, as well as their splitting into multiple droplets by confinement-induced frustration. Our quantum Monte Carlo approach goes beyond the limits of the established effective mean-field theories for dipolar quantum gases, revealing small droplets produced by strong dipolar interactions outside known stable regimes. The simulations include realistic molecular interactions and therefore have direct relevance for current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum state transfer via feedforward cancellation of optical phase noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many experimental platforms for quantum science depend on state control via laser fields. Frequently, however, the control fidelity is limited by optical phase noise. This is exacerbated in stabilized laser systems where high-frequency phase noise is an unavoidable consequence of feedback. Here we implement an optical feedforward technique to suppress laser phase noise in the STIRAP state transfer of ultracold RbCs molecules, across 114 THz, from a weakly bound Feshbach state to the rovibrational ground state. By performing over 100 state transfers on single molecules, we measure a significantly enhanced transfer efficiency of 98.7(1)% limited only by available laser intensity.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of elementary excitations from quench dynamics in a dipolar XY Rydberg simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a new form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, which probes the low-energy excitations of a many-body system. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling relation in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In delocalized systems, particle number fluctuations, also known as quantum surface roughness, and the mean-square displacement exhibit a temporal power-law growth followed by a saturation to a system-size-dependent value. We use simple scaling arguments to show that these quantities satisfy the Family-Vicsek scaling law and derive a dynamic scaling relation between the dynamical exponents, assuming that the saturation times of both quantities scale similarly with the system size. This relation clarifies the mechanism behind quantum surface roughness growth and suggests that diffusive quantum many-body systems belong to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. Moreover, it provides a convenient way to assess quantum transport in cold-atom experiments. We numerically verify our results by studying two non-interacting models and one interacting model having regimes with distinct dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current fluctuations from Euler hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>
