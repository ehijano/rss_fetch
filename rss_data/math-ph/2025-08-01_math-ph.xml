      <title>Derivations of two one-dimensional models for transversely curved shallow shells: one leads to relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\Gamma$-limit of sequences of variational problems for straight, transversely curved shallow shells, as the width of the planform $\varepsilon$ goes to zero.
  The energy is of von K\'arm\'an type for shallow shells under suitable boundary conditions. What distinguishes the various regimes is the scaling of the stretching energy $\sim \varepsilon^{2\beta}$, with $\beta$ a positive number. We derive two one-dimensional models as $\beta$ ranges in $(0, 2]$. Remarkably, boundary conditions are essential to get compactness.
  We show that for $\beta \in (0, 2)$ the $\Gamma$-limit leads to relaxation: the limit membrane energy vanishes on compression. For $\beta=2$ there is no relaxation, and the limit model is a nonlinear energy coupling four kinematical descriptors in a nontrivial way.
  As special cases of the latter limit model, a nonlinear Vlasov torsion theory and a nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory can be deduced.</description>

      <title>Segal-Sugawara vectors for orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the centre of the affine vertex algebra at the critical level associated with the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra. It is well-known that the centre is a commutative superalgebra, and we construct a family of its elements in an explicit form. In particular, this gives a new proof of the formulas for the central elements for the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras. Our arguments rely on the properties of a new extended Brauer-type algebra.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and (iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development, particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.</description>

      <title>An $N$-independent tensor decomposition for SU($N$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To facilitate a simultaneous treatment of an arbitrary number of colors in representation theory-based descriptions of QCD color structure, we derive an $N$-independent reduction of SU($N$) tensor products. To this end, we label each irreducible representation by a pair of Young diagrams, with parts acting on quarks and antiquarks. By combining this with a column-wise multiplication of Young diagrams, we generalize the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the product of two Young diagrams to the product of two Young diagram pairs, achieving a general-$N$ decomposition.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Representations for Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamming Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the set of words of a given length for a given alphabet, the Hamming metric between two such words is the number of positions where the two words differ. A quantum version of the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states was introduced in 2021 by De Palma, Marvian, Trevisan and Lloyd. For the quantum version the alphabet is replaced by a full matrix algebra, and the set of words is replaced by the tensor product of a corresponding number of copies of that full matrix algebra. While De Palma et al. work primarily at the level of states, they do obtain the corresponding seminorm (the quantum Hamming metric) on the algebra of observables that plays the role of assigning Lipschitz constants to functions. A suitable such seminorm on a unital C*-algebra is the current common method for defining a quantum metric on a C*-algebra.
  In this paper we will reverse the process, by first expressing the Hamming metric in terms of the C*-algebra of functions on the set of words, and then dropping the requirement that the algebra be commutative so as to obtain the quantum Hamming metric. From that we obtain the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states. Along the way we show that many of the steps can be put in more general forms of some interest, notably for infinite-dimensional C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>

      <title>Spacetime inextensibility criteria by volume-distance-ratio asymptote and applications to naked singularities and FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i) $C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim t$. The key estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with the scale factor $t$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation, Gibbs relaxation, and cross estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the propagation of chaos and the relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. While it is known that propagation of chaos holds at rate $O(N^{-1})$ uniformly in time, and Gibbs relaxation at rate $O(e^{-ct})$ uniformly in $N$, we go a step further by showing that the cross error between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. For translation-invariant systems on the torus, this leads to an improved mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density: the error decreases from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. We also derive new results on Gibbs relaxation and present partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <title>Path integral analysis of Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems in the complex plane: Establishing the relation between instantons and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in theoretical physics, with quantum-mechanical applications typically confined to cases for which the eigenfunctions are required to be normalizable on the real axis. However, seeking the spectrum of resonant states for metastable potentials or comprehending $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scenarios requires the broader study of eigenvalue problems for which the boundary conditions are provided in specific angular sectors of the complex plane. We generalize the conventional path integral treatment to such nonstandard boundary value problems, allowing the extraction of spectral information using functional methods. We find that the arising functional integrals are naturally defined on a complexified integration contour, encapsulating the demanded sectorial boundary conditions of the associated eigenvalue problem. The attained results are applied to the analysis of resonant ground-state energies, through which we identify the previously elusive one-to-one correspondence between decay rates derived from real-time quantum tunneling dynamics and those obtained via the Euclidean instanton method.</description>

      <title>Fuss--Catalan algebras on generalized Dyck paths via non-crossing partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Fuss--Catalan algebras, which are generalizations of the Temperley--Lieb algebra and act on generalized Dyck paths, through non-crossing partitions. First, the Temperley--Lieb algebra is defined on non-crossing partitions, and a bijection between a Dyck path and a non-crossing partition is shown to be compatible with the Temperley--Lieb algebra on Dyck paths, or equivalently chord diagrams. We show that the Kreweras endomorphism on non-crossing partitions is equivalent to the rotation of chord diagrams under the bijection. Secondly, by considering an increasing $r$-chain in the graded lattice of non-crossing partitions, we define the Fuss--Catalan algebras on increasing $r$-chains. Through a bijection between an increasing $r$-chain and a generalized Dyck path, one naturally obtains the Fuss--Catalan algebra on generalized Dyck paths. As generalizations of the Fuss--Catalan algebra, we introduce the one- and two-boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras. Increasing $r$-chains of symmetric non-crossing partitions give symmetric generalized Dyck paths by the bijection, and the boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras naturally act on them. We show that these representations are compatible with the diagrammatic representations of the algebras by use of generalized chord diagrams. Thirdly, we discuss the integrability of the Fuss--Catalan algebras. For the Fuss--Catalan algebras with boundaries, we obtain a new solution of the reflection equation in the case of $r=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a hierarchy of the mKdV equation is integrated by the methods of algebraic geometry. The mKdV hierarchy in question arises on coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$, and employs a family of hyperelliptic curves as spectral curves. A generic form of the finite-gap solution in any genus is obtained in terms of the $\wp$-functions, which generalize the Weierstrass $\wp$-function. Reality conditions for quasi-periodic wave solutions are completely specified. The obtained solutions are illustrated by plots in small genera.</description>

      <title>Exact values of Fourier dimensions of Gaussian multiplicative chaos on high dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact values of the Fourier dimensions for Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ for all integers $d \ge 1$. This resolves a problem left open in previous works [LQT24,LQT25] for high dimensions $d\ge 3$. The proof relies on a new construction of log-correlated Gaussian fields admitting specific decompositions into smooth processes with high regularity. This construction enables a multi-resolution analysis to obtain sharp local estimates on the measure's Fourier decay. These local estimates are then integrated into a global bound using Pisier's martingale type inequality for vector-valued martingales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for deriving on-shell recursion relations, with a specific focus on biadjoint and pure Yang-Mills theories. Starting from the double-cover CHY factorization formulae, we identify a suitable set of independent kinematic variables that enables the reconstruction of amputated currents from amplitudes. As a byproduct, this new recursive structure recasts the BCJ numerators into an explicitly on-shell factorized form.</description>

      <title>How to Incorporate Higher-order Interactions in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes. This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware. Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Kirkwood-Dirac positivity on second countable LCA groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay of equilibrium states and the Fibonacci Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show positivity of the lower Fourier dimension for equilibrium states of nonlinear, area preserving, Axiom A diffeomorphisms on surfaces. To do so, we use the sum-product phenomenon to reduce Fourier decay to the study of some temporal distance function for a well chosen suspension flow, whose mixing properties reflects the nonlinearity of our base dynamics. We then generalize in an Axiom A setting the methods of Tsujii-Zhang, dealing with exponential mixing of three-dimensional Anosov flows arXiv:2006.04293. The nonlinearity condition is generic and can be checked in concrete contexts. As a corollary, we prove power Fourier decay for the density of states measure of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, which is related to the measure of maximal entropy of the Fibonacci trace map. This proves positivity of the lower Fourier dimension for the spectrum of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, and suggest strong phase-averaged dispersive estimates in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions for open XXZ spin 1/2 quantum chains with unparallel boundary magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our derivation of the correlation functions of open quantum spin 1/2 chains with unparallel magnetic fields on the edges; this time for the more involved case of the XXZ spin 1/2 chains. We develop our study in the framework of the quantum Separation of Variables (SoV), which gives us both the complete spectrum characterization and simple scalar product formulae for separate states, including transfer matrix eigenstates. Here, we leave the boundary magnetic field in the first site of the chain completely arbitrary, and we fix the boundary field in the last site $N$ of the chain to be a specific value along the $z$-direction. This is a natural first choice for the unparallel boundary magnetic fields. We prove that under these special boundary conditions, on the one side, we have a simple enough complete spectrum description in terms of homogeneous Baxter like $TQ$-equation. On the other side, we prove a simple enough description of the action of a basis of local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates as linear combinations of separate states. Thanks to these results, we achieve our main goal to derive correlation functions for a set of local operators both for the finite and half-infinite chains, with multiple integral formulae in this last case.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions for the open XXZ chain with non-longitudinal boundary fields : the case with a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of [1], in which a set of matrix elements of local operators was computed for the XXZ spin-1/2 open chain with a particular case of unparallel boundary fields. Here, we extend these results to the more general case in which both fields are non-longitudinal and related by one constraint, allowing for a partial description of the spectrum by usual Bethe equations. More precisely, the complete spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized within the Separation of Variables (SoV) framework. One uses here the fact that, under the constraint, a part of this SoV spectrum can be described via solutions of a usual, homogeneous, TQ-equation, with corresponding transfer matrix eigenstates coinciding with generalized Bethe states. We explain how to generically compute the action of a basis of local operators on such kind of states, and this under the most general boundary condition on the last site of the chain. As a result, we can compute the matrix elements of some of these basis elements in any eigenstate described by the homogenous TQ-equation. Assuming, following a conjecture of Nepomechie and Ravanini, that the ground state itself can be described in this framework, we obtain multiple integral representations for these matrix elements in the half-infinite chain limit, generalizing those previously obtained in the case of longitudinal boundary fields and in the case of the special boundary conditions considered in [1].</description>

      <title>Polynomially Superintegrable Hamiltonians Separating in Cartesian Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of finding superintegrable Hamiltonians and their integrals of motion can be reduced to solving a series of compatibility equations that result from the overdetermination of the commutator or Poisson bracket relations. The computation of the compatibility equations requires a general formula for the coefficients, which in turn must depend on the potential to be solved for. This is in general a nonlinear problem and quite difficult. Thus, research has focused on dividing the classes of potential into standard and exotic ones so that a number of parameters may be set to zero and the coefficients may be obtained in a simpler setting. We have developed a new method in both the classical and quantum setting which readily yields a formula for the coefficients of the invariant without recourse to this division in the case of Cartesian-separable Hamiltonians. Even though they allow separation of variables as they in general involve potential in terms of higher transcendental and beyond hypergeometric for their wavefunctions, they are quite non-trivial models. The expressions we obtain are in general non-polynomial in the momenta whose fractional terms can be arbitrarily set to zero. These conditions are equivalent to the compatibility equations, but the only unknowns in addition to the potential are constant parameters. We also give the fourth-order standard potentials, and conjectures about general families.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with Surface Tension in Compressible Ideal MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current-vortex sheet is one of the characteristic discontinuities in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The motion of current-vortex sheets is described by a free-interface problem of two-phase MHD flows with magnetic fields tangential to the interface. This paper is the first part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for compressible current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension. In this paper, we prove the local well-posedness and the incompressible limit of current-vortex sheets with surface tension. The key observation is a hidden structure of Lorentz force in the vorticity analysis which motivates us to establish the uniform estimates in anisotropic-type Sobolev spaces with weights of Mach number determined by the number of tangential derivatives. Besides, our framework of iteration and approximation to prove the local existence of vortex-sheet problems does not rely on Nash-Moser iteration. Furthermore, the local existence of current-vortex sheets without surface tension can be proved by taking zero-surface-tension limit under certain stability conditions, which is established in [73] (the second part of the two-paper sequence).</description>

      <title>Scattering and localized states for defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Parity questions in critical planar Brownian loop-soups (or "where did the free planar bosons go?")</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup is an infinite collection of non-interacting Brownian loops in a planar domain that possesses some combinatorial features related to the notion of indistinguishability of bosons. The properly renormalized occupation time field of this collection of loops is known to be distributed like the properly defined square of a Gaussian free field. In the present paper, we investigate aspects of the question about how much information these fields provide about the loop-soup. Among other things, we show that the exact set of points that are actually visited by some loops in the loop-soup is not determined by these fields. We further prove that given the fields, a dense family of special points will each have a conditional probability 1/2 of being part of the loop-soup. We also exhibit another instance where the possible decompositions (given the field) into individual loops and excursions can be grouped into two clearly different groups, each having a conditional probability 1/2 of occurring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we classify linear categorified open topological field theories in dimension two by pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories, a type of monoidal category equipped with a weak, not necessarily rigid duality. In combination with recently developed string-net techniques, this leads to a new description of the spaces of conformal blocks of Drinfeld centers $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of pivotal finite tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of the modular envelope of the cyclic associative operad. If $\mathcal{C}$ is unimodular, we prove that the space of conformal blocks inherits the structure of a module over the algebra of class functions of $\mathcal{C}$ for every free boundary component. As a further application, we prove that the sewing along a boundary circle for the modular functor for $Z(\mathcal{C})$ can be decomposed into a sewing procedure along an interval and the application of the partial trace. Finally, we construct mapping class group representations from Grothendieck-Verdier categories that are not necessarily rigid and make precise how these generalize existing constructions.</description>

      <title>Two-Parameter Quantum Groups and $R$-Matrices: Classical Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems and isochronous connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral to the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels. The spacing between the energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Top eigenpair statistics of diluted Wishart matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute the statistics of the top eigenpair of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio and a bounded number of nonzero entries. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm, and the resulting stable populations are then used to evaluate the density of the top eigenvector's components. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.</description>

      <title>Weighing the curvature invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors (featuring ideal fluids, scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic fields), independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal pseudosymmetries and B\"acklund transformations as $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how factorisation with respect to nonlocal pseudosymmetries allows one to obtain B\"acklund transformations, interpreted as nonlocal $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms of differential equations. According to this approach, which is illustrated through several examples, the B\"acklund transformations are determined by basic invariants of the exploited nonlocal pseudosymmetries.</description>

      <title>Sturm-Liouville operators with periodically modulated parameters. Part I: Regular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Sturm-Liouville operators with periodically modulated parameters. Their spectral properties depend on the monodromy matrix of the underlying periodic problem computed for the spectral parameter equal to $0$. Under certain assumptions, by studying the asymptotic behavior of Christoffel functions and density of states, we prove that the spectral density is a continuous positive everywhere function on the real line.</description>
