      <title>Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses in Total Variation via Algorithmic Stochastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of algorithmically sampling from the Gibbs measure of a mixed $p$-spin spherical spin glass. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that samples from the Gibbs measure up to vanishing total variation error, for any model whose mixture satisfies $$\xi''(s) &lt; \frac{1}{(1-s)^2}, \qquad \forall s\in [0,1).$$ This includes the pure $p$-spin glasses above a critical temperature that is within an absolute ($p$-independent) constant of the so-called shattering phase transition. Our algorithm follows the algorithmic stochastic localization approach introduced in (Alaoui, Montanari, Sellke, 20022). A key step of this approach is to estimate the mean of a sequence of tilted measures. We produce an improved estimator for this task by identifying a suitable correction to the TAP fixed point selected by approximate message passing (AMP). As a consequence, we improve the algorithm's guarantee over previous work, from normalized Wasserstein to total variation error. In particular, the new algorithm and analysis opens the way to perform inference about one-dimensional projections of the measure.</description>

      <title>Divergence metrics in the study of Markov and hidden Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is in two parts. In the first part of this paper, formulae for f-divergence for a continuous Markov process are reviewed. Applications of these formulae are described for the problems of stochastic stability, second law of thermodynamics, and non-equilibrium extensions thereof. The first part sets the stage for considering the f-divergence for hidden Markov processes which is the focus of the second part. For hidden Markov processes, again based on the use of f-divergence, analyses of filter stability and stochastic thermodynamics are described. The latter is used to illustrate the Maxwell demon for an over-damped Langevin model with white noise type observations. The expository nature of the paper combined with consistent formalism for both Markov and hidden Markov processes is written to be useful for researchers working on related themes in disparate areas.</description>

      <title>Critical beta-splitting, via contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree of poly-logarithmic height. Recently, by a technical analysis, Aldous and Pittel proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height $H_n$ of a random leaf.
  We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These techniques were developed by Neininger and R\"uschendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the first two moments of $H_n$, with great precision. We show that a limit theorem follows, and bound the distance from normality.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems associated with the hierarchical Dirichlet process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirichlet process is a discrete random measure specified by a concentration parameter and a base distribution, and is used as a prior distribution in Bayesian nonparametrics. The hierarchical Dirichlet process generalizes the Dirichlet process by randomizing the base distribution through a draw from another Dirichlet process. It is motivated by the study of groups of clustered data, where the group specific Dirichlet processes are linked through an intergroup Dirichlet process. Focusing on an individual group, the hierarchical Dirichlet process is a discrete random measure whose weights have stronger dependence than the weights of the Dirichlet process. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the power sum symmetric polynomials for the vector of weights of the hierarchical Dirichlet process when the corresponding concentration parameters tend to infinity. We establish central limit theorems and obtain explicit representations for the asymptotic variances, with the latter clearly showing the impact of the hierarchical structure. These objects are closely related to the homozygosity in population genetics, the Simpson diversity index in ecology, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index in economics.</description>

      <title>Fractal uncertainty principle for random Cantor sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) for random fractal sets. In the prequel (arXiv:2107.08276), we considered the Cantor sets in the discrete setting with alphabets randomly chosen from a base of digits so the dimension d is in (0,2/3). We proved that, with overwhelming probability, the FUP with an exponent &gt;=1/2-3d/4- holds for these discrete Cantor sets with random alphabets.
  In this sequel, we construct random Cantor sets with dimension d in (0,2/3) in R via a different random procedure from the one in the prequel. We prove that, with overwhelming probability, the FUP with an exponent &gt;=1/2-3d/4- holds. The proof follows from establishing a Fourier decay estimate of the corresponding random Cantor measures, which is in turn based on a concentration of measure phenomenon in an appropriate probability space for the random Cantor sets.</description>

      <title>Strategy Complexity of B\"uchi Objectives in Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 2-player concurrent stochastic B\"uchi games on countable graphs. Two players, Max and Min, seek respectively to maximize and minimize the probability of visiting a set of target states infinitely often. We show that there always exist $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies that use just a step counter plus 1 bit of public memory. This upper bound holds for all countable graphs, but it is a new result even for the special case of finite graphs. The upper bound is tight in the sense that Max strategies that use just a step counter, or just finite memory, are not sufficient even on finite game graphs.
  The upper bound is a consequence of a slightly stronger new result: $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the combined B\"uchi and Transience objective require just 1 bit of public memory (but cannot be memoryless). Our proof techniques also yield a closely related result, that $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the Transience objective alone (which is only meaningful in infinite graphs) can be memoryless.</description>

      <title>Fock space of local fields of the discrete GFF and its scaling limit bosonic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To connect conformal field theories (CFT) to probabilistic lattice models, recent works [HKV22, Ada23] have introduced a novel definition of local fields of the lattice models. Local fields in this picture are probabilistically concrete: they are built from random variables in the model. The key insight is that discrete complex analysis ideas allow to equip the space of local fields with the main structure of a CFT: a representation of the Virasoro algebra.
  In this article, for the first time, we fully analyze the structure of the space of local fields of a lattice model as a representation, and use this to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the local fields of a lattice model and those of a conformal field theory. The CFT we consider is probabilistically realized in terms of the gradient of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). Its space of local fields is just a bosonic Fock space for two chiral symmetry algebras. The corresponding lattice model is the discrete Gaussian Free Field. Our first main result is that the space of local fields of polynomials in the gradient of the discrete GFF is isomorphic to the Fock space. Notably, local fields in this setup make sense with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Our second main result is that with the appropriate renormalization, correlation functions of local fields of the discrete GFF converge in the scaling limit to the correlation functions of the CFT. The renormalization needed is, conceptually correctly, according to the eigenvalue of the Virasoro generator $L_0 + \bar{L}_0$ on the local field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Age of Information with Multiple Coexisting Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the distribution of the Age of Information (AoI) of a tagged data stream sharing a processor with a set of other data streams. We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first major contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream's inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Estimates on Conformally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental gap is the difference between the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of a Schr\"odinger operator (and the Laplacian, in particular). For horoconvex domains in hyperbolic space, Nguyen, Stancu and Wei conjectured that it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the fundamental gap in terms of the diameter of the domain and the dimension [IMRN2022]. In this article, we prove this conjecture by establishing conformal log-concavity estimates for the first eigenfunction. This builds off earlier work by the authors and Saha as well as recent work by Cho, Wei and Yang. We also prove spectral gap estimates for a more general class of problems on conformally flat manifolds and investigate the relationship between the gap and the inradius. For example, we establish gap estimates for domains in $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ which are convex with respect to the universal affine cover</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Exact propagators of one-dimensional self-interacting random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting random walks (SIRWs) show long-range memory effects that result from the interaction of the random walker at time $t$ with the territory already visited at earlier times $t'&lt;t$. This class of non-Markovian random walks has applications in contexts as diverse as foraging theory, the behaviour of living cells, and even machine learning. Despite this importance and numerous theoretical efforts, the propagator, which is the distribution of the walker's position and arguably the most fundamental quantity to characterize the process, has so far remained out of reach for all but a single class of SIRW. Here we fill this gap and provide an exact and explicit expression for the propagator of two important classes of SIRWs, namely, the once-reinforced random walk and the polynomially self-repelling walk. These results give access to key observables, such as the diffusion coefficient, which so far had not been determined. We also uncover an inherently non-Markovian mechanism that tends to drive the walker away from its starting point.</description>

      <title>Conformally invariant random fields, quantum Liouville measures, and random Paneitz operators on Riemannian manifolds of even dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For large classes of even-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$, we construct and analyze conformally invariant random fields. These centered Gaussian fields $h=h_g$, called co-polyharmonic Gaussian fields, are characterized by their covariance kernels $k$ which exhibit a precise logarithmic divergence: $|k(x,y)-\log\frac1{d(x,y)}|\le C$. They share a fundamental quasi-invariance property under conformal transformations.
  In terms of the co-polyharmonic Gaussian field $h$, we define the quantum Liouville measure, a random measure on $M$, heuristically given as $$ d\mu_g^{h}(x):= e^{\gamma h(x)-\frac{\gamma^2}2k(x,x)}\,d \text{vol}_g(x)$$ and rigorously obtained as almost sure weak limit of the right-hand side with $h$ replaced by suitable regular approximations $h_\ell, \ell\in{\mathbb N}$. In terms on the quantum Liouville measure, we define the Liouville Brownian motion on $M$ and the random GJMS operators.
  Finally, we present an approach to a conformal field theory in arbitrary even dimensions with an ansatz based on Branson's $Q$-curvature: we give a rigorous meaning to the Polyakov-Liouville measure $$ d\boldsymbol{\nu}^*_g(h) =\frac1{Z^*_g} \exp\Big(- \int \Theta\,Q_g h + m e^{\gamma h} d \text{vol}_g\Big) \exp\Big(-\frac{a_n}{2} {\mathfrak p}_g(h,h)\Big) dh, $$ and we derive the corresponding conformal anomaly.
  The set of admissible manifolds is conformally invariant. It includes all compact 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, all compact non-negatively curved Einstein manifolds of even dimension, and large classes of compact hyperbolic manifolds of even dimension. However, not every compact even-dimensional Riemannian manifold is admissible.
  Our results rely on new sharp estimates for heat kernels and higher order Green kernels on arbitrary compact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition for random forests in $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arboreal gas is the probability measure on (unrooted spanning) forests of a graph in which each forest is weighted by a factor $\beta&gt;0$ per edge. It arises as the $q\to 0$ limit of the $q$-state random cluster model with $p=\beta q$. We prove that in dimensions $d\geq 3$ the arboreal gas undergoes a percolation phase transition. This contrasts with the case of $d=2$ where no percolation transition occurs.
  The starting point for our analysis is an exact relationship between the arboreal gas and a non-linear sigma model with target space the fermionic hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$. This latter model can be thought of as the $0$-state Potts model, with the arboreal gas being its random cluster representation. Unlike the standard Potts models, the $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$ model has continuous symmetries. By combining a renormalisation group analysis with Ward identities we prove that this symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures. In terms of the arboreal gas, this symmetry breaking translates into the existence of infinite trees in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis also establishes massless free field correlations at low temperatures and the existence of a macroscopic tree on finite tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-state life insurance, an adequate balance between analytic tractability, computational efficiency, and statistical flexibility is of great importance. This might explain the popularity of Markov chain modelling, where matrix analytic methods allow for a comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, Markov chain modelling is unable to capture duration effects, so this paper presents aggregate Markov models as an alternative. Aggregate Markov models retain most of the analytical tractability of Markov chains, yet are non-Markovian and thus more flexible. Based on an explicit characterization of the fundamental martingales, matrix representations of the expected accumulated cash flows and corresponding prospective reserves are derived for duration-dependent payments with and without incidental policyholder behaviour. Throughout, special attention is given to a semi-Markovian case. Finally, the methods and results are illustrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time branching annihilating random walk (BARW) on the $d$-dimensional lattice. Each particle produces a Poissonian number of offspring with mean $\mu$ which independently move to a uniformly chosen site within a fixed distance $R$ from their parent's position. Whenever a site is occupied by at least two particles, all the particles at that site are annihilated. We prove that for any $\mu&gt;1$ the process survives when $R$ is sufficiently large. For fixed $R$ we show that the process dies out if $\mu$ is too small or too large. Furthermore, we exhibit an interval of $\mu$-values for which the process survives and possesses a unique non-trivial ergodic equilibrium for $R$ sufficiently large. We also prove complete convergence for that case.</description>

We also explain the relationship of this approach to related recent and less recent developments such as Eldan's stochastic localisation and the F\"ollmer process, the Bou\'e--Dupuis variational formula and the Barashkov--Gubinelli approach, the transportation of measure perspective, and the classical analogues of these ideas for Hamilton--Jacobi equations which arise in mean-field limits.</description>

      <title>Distributional properties of jumps of multi-type CBI processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distributional properties of jumps of multi-type continuous state and continuous time branching processes with immigration (multi-type CBI processes). We derive an expression for the distribution function of the first jump time of a multi-type CBI process with jump size in a given Borel set having finite total L\'evy measure, which is defined as the sum of the measures appearing in the branching and immigration mechanisms of the multi-type CBI process in question. Using this we derive an expression for the distribution function of the local supremum of the norm of the jumps of a multi-type CBI process. Further, we show that if $A$ is a nondegenerate rectangle anchored at zero and with total L\'evy measure zero, then the probability that the local coordinate-wise supremum of jumps of the multi-type CBI process belongs to $A$ is zero. We also prove that a converse statement holds.</description>

  (i) reversible w.r.t.~the entropic measure ${\mathbb P}^\beta$ on ${\mathcal P}(M)$, heuristically given as $$d\mathbb{P}^\beta(\mu)=\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta \, \text{Ent}(\mu| m)}\ d\mathbb{P}^*(\mu);$$ (ii) associated with a regular Dirichlet form with carr\'e du champ derived from the Wasserstein gradient in the sense of Otto calculus $${\mathcal E}_W(f)=\liminf_{g\to f}\ \frac12\int_{{\mathcal P}(M)} \big\|\nabla_W g\big\|^2(\mu)\ d{\mathbb P}^\beta(\mu);$$ (iii) non-degenerate, at least in the case of the $n$-sphere and the $n$-torus.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Processes on $p$-Wasserstein Space over Banach Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study diffusion processes on the $p$-Wasserstein space $\scr P_p $ for $p\in [1,\infty)$ over a separable, reflexive Banach space $X$, we present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms in $L^2(\scr P_p,\Lambda)$ for a reference probability $\Lambda$ on $\scr P_p$. It is formulated in terms of an upper bound condition with the uniform norm of the intrinsic derivative. The condition is easy to check in relevant applications and allows to construct a type of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on $\scr P_p$. We find a versatile class of quasi-regular local Dirichlet forms on $\scr P_p$ by using images of Dirichlet forms on the tangent space $L^p(X\to X,\mu_0)$ at a reference point $\mu_0\in \scr P_p$. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type Dirichlet form is an important example in this class. An $L^2$-estimate for the corresponding heat kernel is derived, based on the eigenvalues of the covariance operator of the underlying Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the (random) total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached. In particular, we prove that it centers around $\frac{2}{7}n\ln n$ and that it has variations linear in $n$, whose distribution we can describe explicitly.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Aggregation with Error Bounds on Transient Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the existing theory of formal error bounds for the transient distribution of an aggregated (or lumped) Markov chain when compared to the transient distribution of the original chain, for both discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains. In the discrete-time setting, we bound the stepwise increment of the error, and in the continuous-time setting, we bound the rate at which the error grows. We then compare these error bounds with relevant concepts in the literature such as exact and ordinary lumpability as well as deflatability and aggregatability. These concepts define stricter than necessary conditions to identify settings in which the aggregation error is zero. We also consider possible algorithms for finding suitable aggregations for which the formal error bounds are low, and we analyse first experiments with these algorithms on different models.</description>

      <title>An adaptation of InfoMap to absorbing random walks using absorption-scaled graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InfoMap is a popular approach to detect densely connected "communities" of nodes in networks. To detect such communities, InfoMap uses random walks and ideas from information theory. Motivated by the dynamics of disease spread on networks, whose nodes can have heterogeneous disease-removal rates, we adapt InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this, we use absorption-scaled graphs (in which edge weights are scaled according to absorption rates) and Markov time sweeping. One of our adaptations of InfoMap converges to the standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which the node-absorption rates approach $0$. We demonstrate that the community structure that one obtains using our adaptations of InfoMap can differ markedly from the community structure that one detects using methods that do not account for node-absorption rates. We also illustrate that the community structure that is induced by heterogeneous absorption rates can have important implications for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics on ring-lattice networks. For example, in some situations, the outbreak duration is maximized when a moderate number of nodes have large node-absorption rates.</description>

      <title>Insights from number theory into the critical Kauffman model with connectivity one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kauffman model of genetic computation highlights the importance of criticality at the border of order and chaos. The model with connectivity one is of special interest because it is exactly solvable. But our understanding of its behavior is incomplete, and much of what we do know relies on heuristic arguments. Here, we show that the key quantities in the model are intimately related to aspects of number theory. Using these links, we derive improved bounds for the number of attractors as well as the mean attractor length, which is harder to compute. Our work suggests that number theory is the natural language for deducing many properties of the critical Kauffman model with connectivity one, and opens the door to further insight into this deceptively simple model.</description>

      <title>Prelimit Coupling and Steady-State Convergence of Constant-stepsize Nonsmooth Contractive SA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Q-learning, we study nonsmooth contractive stochastic approximation (SA) with constant stepsize. We focus on two important classes of dynamics: 1) nonsmooth contractive SA with additive noise, and 2) synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning, which features both additive and multiplicative noise. For both dynamics, we establish weak convergence of the iterates to a stationary limit distribution in Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we propose a prelimit coupling technique for establishing steady-state convergence and characterize the limit of the stationary distribution as the stepsize goes to zero. Using this result, we derive that the asymptotic bias of nonsmooth SA is proportional to the square root of the stepsize, which stands in sharp contrast to smooth SA. This bias characterization allows for the use of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation for bias reduction in nonsmooth SA.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>
