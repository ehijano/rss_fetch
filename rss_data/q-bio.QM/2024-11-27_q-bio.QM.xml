      <title>Comparing biological models and theories of life with process-enablement graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many perspectives through which biologists can study a particular living system. As a result, models of biological systems are often quite different from one another, both in form and size. Thus, in order for us to generate reliable knowledge of a particular system, we need to understand how the models that represent it are related. In previous work, we constructed a general model comparison framework to compare models representing any physical system. Here, we develop an alternative methodology that focuses on a fundamental feature of living systems, namely self-organisation. We employ a graph theoretic formalism which captures self-organising processes as cycles within particular kinds of graphs: process-enablement graphs. We then build the mathematical tools needed to compare biological models and their corresponding descriptions of self-organisation in a consistent and rigorous manner. We apply our formalism to a range of classical theories of life to show how they are similar and where they differ. We also investigate examples of putatively abiotic systems which nonetheless still realise primitive forms of self-organisation. While our current framework does not demarcate living systems from nonliving ones, it does allow us to better study the grey area surrounding life's edge.</description>

      <title>Structural identifiability of linear-in-parameter parabolic PDEs through auxiliary elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter identifiability is often requisite to the effective application of mathematical models in the interpretation of biological data, however theory applicable to the study of partial differential equations remains limited. We present a new approach to structural identifiability analysis of fully observed parabolic equations that are linear in their parameters. Our approach frames identifiability as an existence and uniqueness problem in a closely related elliptic equation and draws, for homogeneous equations, on the well-known Fredholm alternative to establish unconditional identifiability, and cases where specific choices of initial and boundary conditions lead to non-identifiability. While in some sense pathological, we demonstrate that this loss of structural identifiability has ramifications for practical identifiability; important particularly for spatial problems, where the initial condition is often limited by experimental constraints. For cases with nonlinear reaction terms, uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary elliptic equation corresponds to identifiability, often leading to unconditional global identifiability under mild assumptions. We present analysis for a suite of simple scalar models with various boundary conditions that include linear (exponential) and nonlinear (logistic) source terms, and a special case of a two-species cell motility model. We conclude by discussing how this new perspective enables well-developed analysis tools to advance the developing theory underlying structural identifiability of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Laws Meet Protein Sequences: A Comparative Analysis of Subword Tokenization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial step in processing protein sequences for machine learning models, as proteins are complex sequences of amino acids that require meaningful segmentation to capture their functional and structural properties. However, existing subword tokenization methods, developed primarily for human language, may be inadequate for protein sequences, which have unique patterns and constraints. This study evaluates three prominent tokenization approaches, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece, across varying vocabulary sizes (400-6400), analyzing their effectiveness in protein sequence representation, domain boundary preservation, and adherence to established linguistic laws. Our comprehensive analysis reveals distinct behavioral patterns among these tokenizers, with vocabulary size significantly influencing their performance. BPE demonstrates better contextual specialization and marginally better domain boundary preservation at smaller vocabularies, while SentencePiece achieves better encoding efficiency, leading to lower fertility scores. WordPiece offers a balanced compromise between these characteristics. However, all tokenizers show limitations in maintaining protein domain integrity, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Analysis of linguistic law adherence shows partial compliance with Zipf's and Brevity laws but notable deviations from Menzerath's law, suggesting that protein sequences may follow distinct organizational principles from natural languages. These findings highlight the limitations of applying traditional NLP tokenization methods to protein sequences and emphasize the need for developing specialized tokenization strategies that better account for the unique characteristics of proteins.</description>

      <title>Individualized prescriptive inference in ischaemic stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gold standard in the treatment of ischaemic stroke is set by evidence from randomized controlled trials, based on simple descriptions of presumptively homogeneous populations. Yet the manifest complexity of the brain's functional, connective, and vascular architectures introduces heterogeneities that violate the underlying statistical premisses, potentially leading to substantial errors at both individual and population levels. The counterfactual nature of interventional inference renders quantifying the impact of this defect difficult. Here we conduct a comprehensive series of semi-synthetic, biologically plausible, virtual interventional trials across 100M+ distinct simulations. We generate empirically grounded virtual trial data from large-scale meta-analytic connective, functional, genetic expression, and receptor distribution data, with high-resolution maps of 4K+ acute ischaemic lesions. Within each trial, we estimate treatment effects using models varying in complexity, in the presence of increasingly confounded outcomes and noisy treatment responses. Individualized prescriptions inferred from simple models, fitted to unconfounded data, were less accurate than those from complex models, fitted to confounded data. Our results indicate that complex modelling with richly represented lesion data is critical to individualized prescriptive inference in ischaemic stroke.</description>

      <title>JESTR: Joint Embedding Space Technique for Ranking Candidate Molecules for the Annotation of Untargeted Metabolomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint prediction (FP), annotation rates remain low. Results: We introduce in this paper a novel paradigm (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly construct molecular fingerprints or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and spec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5], JESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue towards accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Grained Symmetric Differential Equation Model for Learning Protein-Ligand Binding Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand binding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating transport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding dynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we propose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\times$ speedup compared to standard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML approaches, achieving up to 15$\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and 70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the oscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth dynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD paves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting effective quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching -- the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence -- for localized pulse solutions in models of excitable media. The theory accounts for an additional equivariance compared to the homogeneous ignition problem, and thus requires a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess their accuracy for several models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of continuing a scalar root, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>Is Attention All You Need For Actigraphy? Foundation Models of Wearable Accelerometer Data for Mental Health Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable accelerometry (actigraphy) has provided valuable data for clinical insights since the 1970s and is increasingly important as wearable devices continue to become widespread. The effectiveness of actigraphy in research and clinical contexts is heavily dependent on the modeling architecture utilized. To address this, we developed the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT)--the first pretrained and fully attention-based model designed specifically to handle actigraphy. PAT was pretrained on actigraphy from 29,307 participants in NHANES, enabling it to deliver state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned across various actigraphy prediction tasks in the mental health domain, even in data-limited scenarios. For example, when trained to predict benzodiazepine usage using actigraphy from only 500 labeled participants, PAT achieved an 8.8 percentage-point AUC improvement over the best baseline. With fewer than 2 million parameters and built-in model explainability, PAT is robust yet easy to deploy in health research settings.
