      <title>Revisiting compressible and incompressible pressure-strain interaction in kinetic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the pressure-strain interaction in kinetic turbulence, and in particular we re-examine the decomposition of pressure-strain interaction into compressive and incompressive parts. The pressure dilatation ingredient is clearly due to plasma compressions, but here using kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of plasma turbulence, it is demonstrated that the remaining anisotropic part, often called Pi-D, also contains contributions due to compressive, non solenoidal velocities of the particle species. The compressive Pi-D can play a significant role in systems with low plasma $\beta$ even if the system starts with small density variations. The compressive ingredient of Pi-D is found to be anticorrelated with both incompressive Pi-D and pressure dilatation.</description>

      <title>Integration of Machine Learning-Based Plasma Acceleration Simulations into Geant4: A Case Study with the PALLAS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development and integration of a Machine Learning (ML)-based surrogate model, trained on Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of laser-driven plasma wakefield acceleration source of electrons, into Geant4 simulation toolkit. Our model enables the generation and tracking of plasma-accelerated beams within complete experimental setups, unifying plasma acceleration and Monte Carlo-based simulations, which significantly reduces their complexity and computational cost.
  Our implementation focuses on the PALLAS laser-plasma accelerator test facility, integrating its full experimental setup into Geant4. We describe the ML model, its integration into Geant4, and key simulation results, demonstrating the feasibility of start-to-end simulations of plasma acceleration facilities and applications within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional, gyrotropic plasmas via a non-ideal CGL-MHD framework. Even for an initially isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a striking dependence of the maximum growth rate on plasma-$\beta$, with $\gamma_{max}\tau_{A}\propto\beta^{-1/4}$ in the high-$\beta$ regime, thereby challenging the $\beta$-independence predicted by standard MHD theory. We show that this new scaling emerges from the self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, which can suppress or enhance the instability depending on the underlying plasma parameters. Systematic scans of the Lundquist number, magnetic Prandtl number, and anisotropy degree $\Delta\beta$ highlight conditions under which the tearing mode departs significantly from classical behavior. Our findings emphasize that weak collisionality and gyrotropic effects must be considered to accurately capture tearing evolution in high-$\beta$ plasma environments.</description>

      <title>On the electrons really contributing to dc conductivity of warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic properties of warm dense matter is an active field of research. Understanding transport properties of these states is essential for providing coefficients needed by magneto-radiative hydrodynamics codes for many studies, including hydrodynamic instabilities, energy balances or heating in fusion plasmas, difficult to investigate by experimental means. In this paper, we present an average-atom approach for the calculation of direct-current electric conductivity within Ziman's theory. The mean ion charge $Z^*$, commonly called ionization, is an important input of the Ziman formula, but is not clearly defined within average-atom models. Our study spans a wide range of thermodynamical conditions, i.e., for the densities, from a few $10^{-2}$ to about 4 times the solid's density, and, for the temperatures, typically from 0.1 eV to 700 eV, favorable to large differences in the mean ion charge $Z^*$ according to its definition. We compare and discuss different ways of defining $Z^*$ while trying to figure out which electrons really contribute to electric conduction. We compare our results with experimental data and published theoretical values, in particular from the second transport code comparison workshop, which was held in July 2023 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. These comparisons lead us to propose indicators for the relevance of including different charges predicted by our average-atom model in the definition of $Z^*$.</description>

      <title>A magnetic avalanche as the central engine powering a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are the most powerful, magnetically-driven, explosions in the heliosphere. The nature of magnetic energy release in the solar corona that heats the plasma and accelerates particles in a flare, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we report high-resolution coronal observations of a flare (SOL2024-09-30T23:47) by the Solar Orbiter mission that reveal initially weaker but rapid reconnection events, on timescales of at most a few seconds, leading to a more prominent activity of similar nature that explosively cause a flare. Signatures of this process are further imprinted on the widespread raining plasma blobs with short lifetimes, giving rise to the characteristic ribbon-like emission pattern associated with the flare. Our novel observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasize the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work.</description>

      <title>Tayler instability and dynamo action of cylindric magnetic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tayler instability of an azimuthal magnetic field with one or two ``rings'' along the radius is studied for an axially unbounded Taylor-Couette flow. The rotation law of the conducting fluid is a quasi-Keplerian one. Without rotation all toroidal fields are the more destabilized the more the radial profiles differ from the uniformity. For medium Reynolds numbers of rotation, however, the behaviour of the lines of neutral stability strongly depend on the magnetic Prandtl number. For Pm=1 the differential rotation matches the instability lines of azimuthal fields with and without rings so that the maximally possible Reynolds numbers for fields with smooth radial profiles and such with rings do hardly differ. The magnetic Mach number of the considered examples are of the astrophysically relevant order of magnitude between ten and twenty.
  The nonaxisymmetric instability fluctuations form a weak alpha effect of the mean-field electrodynamics which always changes its sign between the walls independent of the Reynolds number, magnetic Prandtl number or the radial profile of the magnetic background field. The resulting dynamo modes work on a similar axial scale as the Tayler instability, hence they are small-scale dynamos. The fields are axially drifting with high phase velocity where at certain periods the azimuthal fields with one-ring geometry develop to fields with two rings along the radius. It is still open whether and how a nonlinear dynamo model may overcome this puzzling complication.</description>

      <title>Robustness Optimization for Compact Free-electron Laser Driven by Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the shot-to-shot fluctuations inherent to LWFAs remain a major obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with high gain and robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with enhanced robustness and reliability. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 microjoule at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.</description>

      <title>The Solar Enigma Decoding the Mystery of the Hot Corona and Solar Wind Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun's corona, heated to temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin despite lying above the cooler photosphere, has puzzled astrophysicists since its discovery in the 1940s. Prevailing theories, based on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, and micro/nano-flares, fail to fully account for this extreme heating or the origins of the supersonic solar wind. We propose a mechanism in which magnetic reconnection rapidly reconfigures field lines and exerts a torque on the magnetic moment of gyrating charged particles. This torque transfers magnetic energy to the particles, effectively doubling their energy and heating the plasma. As particles traverse multiple reconnection sites, they gradually heat to coronal temperatures. With just a few additional crossings, particles can gain enough energy to overcome the Sun's gravity, directly driving solar wind acceleration. Our hypothesis resolves the coronal heating paradox and unifies solar wind dynamics under a universal astrophysical process. This work redefines our understanding of energy transfer in magnetized plasmas, with implications extending to stellar and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Calibration of hydrogen atoms measurement using femtosecond two-photon laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections, $\sigma^{(2)}$, for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The estimated ratio of the two-photon absorption cross-sections for H and Kr is $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.027\pm 20$%, which is nearly twenty times lower than values previously obtained with narrowband nanosecond lasers. This discrepancy highlights the need for independent calibration of TALIF measurements for a specific laser pulsewidth range.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Characterization of Intermittency in Plasma Turbulence: Single and Double Sheet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas remains an unresolved problem. The most poorly understood aspect is intermittency -- spatio-temporal fluctuations superimposed on the self-similar turbulent motions. We employ a novel machine-learning analysis technique to segment turbulent flow structures into distinct clusters based on statistical similarities across multiple physical features. We apply this technique to kinetic simulations of decaying (freely evolving) and driven (forced) turbulence in a strongly magnetized pair-plasma environment, and find that the previously identified intermittent fluctuations consist of two distinct clusters: i) current sheets, thin slabs of electric current between merging flux ropes, and; ii) double sheets, pairs of oppositely polarized current slabs, possibly generated by two non-linearly interacting Alfv\'en-wave packets. The distinction is crucial for the construction of realistic turbulence sub-grid models.</description>
