      <title>Geometry and Topology of Gradient Shrinking Sasaki-Ricci Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometry and topology of complete gradient shrinking Sasaki-Ricci solitons. We first prove that they must be connected at infinity. This is a Sasaki analogue of gradient shrinking K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. Secondly, with the positive sectional curvature, we show that they must be compact. All results are served as a generalization of Perelman in dimension three, of Naber in dimension four, and of Munteanu-Wang in all dimensions, respectively.</description>

      <title>On contact Hamiltonian functions of singular contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For contact manifolds, it is well-known that the map which assigns to an infinitesimal contact transformation its contact Hamiltonian function is a linear isomorphism, and an explicit local formula for its inverse can be given. In contrast, infinitesimal contact transformations on a singular contact structure have not been well-studied yet. In this article, we show that this map is injective and present an explicit local formula for its inverse when the contact structure has singularities of the first type with structurally smooth Martinet hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Green's function and volume noncollapsing estimates for the K\"ahler-Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a local volume noncollapsing property for the long-time K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a minimal K\"ahler manifold, improving previous results of Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm, Guedj-T\^o and Vu. Similar result is also proved for a twisted K\"ahler-Ricci flow on non-minimal K\"ahler manifolds. In the course of proof, we develop new Green's function estimates for a general K\"ahler family under the $L^{p&gt;1}$ and $L^1(\log L)^{q&gt;n}$ volume density conditions.</description>

      <title>Visualization of curvature on curve and surface by tangential angle parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified method to visualize curvature on planar curves and surfaces of revolution using the tangential angle parameter. For plane curves, placing markers at equal increments of the tangential angle reveals local bending features and naturally highlights inflection points and vertices. This approach extends to surfaces of revolution, where curvature lines drawn at equal tangential angle steps reflect principal curvature variations and naturally expose ridge and parabolic curves. Our method provides clear, consistent visualizations without arbitrary parameter tuning, offering geometric insight for both analysis and design applications.</description>

      <title>The Bernstein problem for Sobolev intrinsic graphs in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first Heisenberg group, we study entire, locally Sobolev intrinsic graphs that are stable for the sub-Riemannian area. We show that, under appropriate integrability conditions for the derivatives, the intrinsic graph must be an intrinsic plane, i.e., a coset of a two dimensional subgroup. This result extends \cite{arXiv:1809.04586} beyond the Lipschitz class.</description>

      <title>Foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in asymptotically flat initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area-constrained critical surfaces for the Hawking quasi-local energy ("Hawking surfaces") provide a natural setting for that energy: they enjoy positivity and rigidity properties. We construct large-scale foliations at infinity by Hawking surfaces in asymptotically Schwarzschild initial data sets. Using a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction within a Willmore-foliation framework, we prove existence and uniqueness of the foliation and study its coordinate center. Under the dominant energy condition, we show that along the leaves of the foliation, the Hawking energy is positive and converges to the ADM energy in the large-sphere limit; moreover, subject to an explicit integral constraint, it is monotone along the foliation. Under weaker assumptions we construct an on-center family of Hawking surfaces that, while not necessarily a foliation, still enjoys positivity and the large-sphere limit. Finally, we obtain a rigidity statement and verify that our hypotheses hold in a broad class of data, initial data sets with harmonic or York asymptotics, thereby demonstrating the robustness of Hawking surfaces as a quasi-local energy tool in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Screw Approach to the Approximation of the Local Geometry of the Configuration Space and of the set of Configurations of Certain Rank of Lower Pair Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A motion of a mechanism is a curve in its configuration space (c-space). Singularities of the c-space are kinematic singularities of the mechanism. Any mobility analysis of a particular mechanism amounts to investigating the c-space geometry at a given configuration. A higher-order analysis is necessary to determine the finite mobility. To this end, past research lead to approaches using higher-order time derivatives of loop closure constraints assuming (implicitly) that all possible motions are smooth. This continuity assumption limits the generality of these methods. In this paper an approach to the higher-order local mobility analysis of lower pair multi-loop linkages is presented. This is based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the geometric constraint mapping, for which a recursive algebraic expression in terms of joint screws is presented. An exhaustive local analysis includes analysis of the set of constraint singularities (configurations where the constraint Jacobian has certain corank). A local approximation of the set of configurations with certain rank is presented, along with an explicit expression for the differentials of Jacobian minors in terms of instantaneous joint screws. The c-space and the set of points of certain corank are therewith locally approximated by an algebraic variety determined algebraically from the mechanism's screw system. Results are shown for a simple planar 4-bar linkage, which exhibits a bifurcation singularity, and for a planar three-loop linkage exhibiting a cusp in c-space. The latter cannot be treated by the higher-order local analysis methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Codimension two spacelike submanifolds into null hypersurfaces of generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study codimension two spacelike submanifolds contained into a general class of null hypersurfaces in generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, refer to as nullcones. In particular we analyze light cones and lightlike cylinders in Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime, as well as null cones in de Sitter spacetime. We give conditions on a radial coordinate that guarantee that such a spacelike submanifold is conformally diffeomorphic to the hyperbolic space, a round cylinder a sphere; respectively. We also provide some non-existence results for weakly trapped submanifolds.</description>

      <title>A proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality using a geometric-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach. The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism. Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS space.</description>

      <title>Hot spots in domains of constant curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove constant-curvature analogues of several results regarding the hot spots conjecture in dimension two. Our main theorem shows that the hot spots conjecture holds for all non-acute geodesic triangles of constant negative curvature. We also prove that, under certain circumstances, on constant (positive or negative) curvature triangles, first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann Laplace eigenfunctions have no non-vertex critical points. Moreover, we show that each of these eigenfunctions is monotonic with respect to some Killing field. Finally, we show that for general simply connected polygons of non-zero constant curvature--with exactly one family of exceptions--second Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian have at most finitely many critical points.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hardy and spectral gap inequalities on special irreversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharpness of various Hardy-type inequalities is well-understood in the reversible Finsler setting; while infinite reversibility implies the failure of these functional inequalities, cf. Krist\'aly, Huang, and Zhao [Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 2020]. However, in the remaining case of irreversible manifolds with finite reversibility, there is no evidence on the sharpness of Hardy-type inequalities. In fact, we are not aware of any particular examples where the sharpness persists. In this paper we present two such examples involving two celebrated inequalities: the classical/weighted Hardy inequality (assuming non-positive flag curvature) and the McKean-type spectral gap estimate (assuming strong negative flag curvature). In both cases, we provide a family of Finsler metric measure manifolds on which these inequalities are sharp. We also establish some sufficient conditions, which guarantee the sharpness of more involved Hardy-type inequalities on these spaces. Our relevant technical tool is a Finslerian extension of the method of Riccati pairs (for proving Hardy inequalities), which also inspires the main ideas of our constructions.</description>

      <title>On Topology of the Infinite-Dimensional Space of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work serves as an opening and basis of an ongoing program investigating topological and geometric aspects of the moduli space of smooth fiberings on a manifold. The present paper focuses on the algebraic and differential topology of this space, and particularly addresses the following three quests in a top-down manner: the classification, for each class the path components, and for each component the homotopy type (as loosely analogous to the those three for studying the moduli of smooth structures: exotic manifolds, mapping class groups, and Smale-type conjectures). The last of the three is infinite-dimensional in nature, as the corresponding moduli space is shown to inherit the structure of a smooth Fr\'echet manifold from the diffeomorphism group through a (infinite-dimensional) principal bundle, with which we establish further connections with the Lie theory of gauge symmetries from one perspective, and with the geometric analysis of extrinsic flows from another. Concretely, we tackle the problem of finding the "homotopy core": a minimal deformation retract that encodes the topological structure of such a moduli space of fibrations; as our first examples, we gave explicit homotopy calculations for various low-dimensional cases which, combined with earlier known cases from others' work, complete the solution to this problem for dimensions up to three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic Calabi-Yau $3$-folds, this article studies a chamber structure in the space of real Cauchy-Riemann operators on a Riemann surface, and constructs three chambered invariants associated with such operators: $n_{\mathrm{Bl}}$, $n_{1,2}$, $n_{2,1}$. The first of these invariants is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic sections of bundles whose fibres are modeled on the blow-up of $\mathbf{C}^2/\{\pm 1\}$. The other two are defined by counting solutions to the ADHM vortex equations. We conjecture that $n_{1,2}$ and $n_{2,1}$ are related to putative symplectic invariants generalizing the Pandharipande-Thomas and rank $2$ Donaldson-Thomas invariants in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liebmann's Theorem is a fundamental result stating that a compact connected convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant mean curvature (cmc) is a totally umbilical sphere. We extend this theorem to surfaces with boundary by showing that a locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surface, bounded by a convex curve in a plane $P$, is contained in one of the halfspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$ determined by $P$. This extension leads to the conclusion that spherical caps are the only examples of locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surfaces with non-zero curvature, bounded by a circle.</description>

      <title>On an Arnold's Conjecture Concerning the Space of Hyperbolic Homogeneous Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of homogeneous polynomials of degree $D$ is a topological space that contains the subspace $Hyp(D)$ constituted only by hyperbolic polynomials. In 2002, V. I. Arnold conjectured that the number of connected components of $Hyp (D)$ increases, as $D$ increases, at least as a linear function of $D$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true. We determine the exact number of connected components of $Hyp (D)$ and we provide a representative for each component. The proof is constructive; our approach uses homotopy invariance of the index of a curve and properties of homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study MRC fibrations of compact K\"ahler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature. We first prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold is rationally connected if its tangent bundle is BC-$p$ positive for all $1\leq p\leq \dim X$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature must be rationally connected, and generalize a result of Heier-Wong and Yang to the conformally K\"ahler case. The second result concern structure theorems for two immediate curvature conditions. We prove that, a compact K\"ahler manifold with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature or semi-positive $k$-scalar curvature, either the rational dimension $\geq n-k+1$ or the universal cover is biholomorphic and isometric to the product of $\mathbb{C}^m\times F$ for some rationally connected manifold $F$.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles: Connections and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities for electrostatic systems with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate electrostatic systems with a nonzero cosmological constant on compact manifolds with boundary. We establish new geometric properties for electrostatic manifolds in higher dimensions, extending previous results in the literature. Moreover, we prove sharp boundary estimates and isoperimetric-type inequalities for electrostatic manifolds, as well as volume and boundary inequalities involving the Brown-York and Hawking masses.</description>

      <title>Polars and antipodal sets of generalized $s$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized $s$-manifolds, which is a generalization of symmetric spaces. Then we give a method to construct generalized $s$-manifolds and present some typical examples. We study polars and antipodal sets of generalized $s$-manifolds aiming to extend the results on compact symmetric spaces due to Chen and Nagano.</description>

      <title>The hyperbolic X-ray transform: new range characterizations, mapping properties and functional relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new singular value decompositions and range characterizations for the X-ray transform on the Poincar\'e disk, intertwining relations with distinguished differential operators of wedge type, and a surjectivity result for the backprojection operator. New functional settings are found, which allow to sharply understand boundary behavior issues and invertibility settings. The approach mainly exploits analogous results obtained only recently in the Euclidean disk, together with the projective equivalence between the two models.</description>
