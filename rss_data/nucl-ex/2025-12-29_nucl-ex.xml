      <title>Investigating charm quark interactions and hadronization in PbPb collisions with $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ and $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charm quarks serve as a sensitive probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), providing direct insights into its formation, evolution, and properties. In this proceeding, we present new high-precision measurements from the CMS experiment in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow of prompt $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ mesons are measured with high precision, extending the kinematic coverage. A comparison of the $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ flow to that of $\mathrm{{D}^{0}}$ mesons is performed to investigate the impact of strange quark hadronization on charm quark collectivity. We further explore charm quark hadronization by measuring the $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$ nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) as a function of transverse momentum for different collision centralities, and the $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$/$\mathrm{{D}^{0}}$ yield ratio in pp, pPb, and Pb-Pb collisions. These results provide crucial constraints on charm quark energy loss and hadronization mechanisms, offering critical tests for theoretical models and advancing our understanding of heavy quark dynamics in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Impact of a Reflecting Material on a Search for Neutron--Antineutron Oscillations using Ultracold Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutron--antineutron oscillations of ultracold neutrons in a storage bottle represented by a one-dimensional potential. The experimental sensitivity is determined by the annihilation rate of antineutrons. Its dependence on the antineutron reflectivity and the relative phase shift between the neutron and the antineutron wavefunctions by a reflection from the wall is derived. Optimization of the antineutron pseudopotential was found crucial to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment. Furthermore, methods are discussed for determining the antineutron pseudopotential, which has only been studied indirectly thus far.</description>

      <title>Probing gluon saturation with forward di-hadron correlations in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical investigation of semi-inclusive forward di-hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions employing the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We focus on the regime where di-hadrons are produced nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane, thereby justifying a transverse-momentum-dependent factorization approach in terms of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Our computation integrates several key elements: i) non-linear rapidity evolution via the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with running coupling, ii) both perturbative and non-perturbative Sudakov resummation, and iii) a phenomenologically constrained model for the initial conditions for small-$x$ gluon distributions. We compare this phenomenological framework to experimental data from the STAR Collaboration on azimuthal correlations in forward di-pion production in both proton-proton and proton-gold collisions. We analyze the systematic theoretical uncertainties associated with the saturation scales of nuclei at the initial scale for rapidity evolution and with those associated with the hadronization process. Finally, we make predictions for the kinematics anticipated to be covered by the ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Selection bias effects on high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ yield and correlation measurements in Oxygen+Oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oxygen+Oxygen (O+O) collisions at RHIC and the LHC offer a unique experimental opportunity to observe the onset of jet quenching in intermediate relativistic collision systems. As with the smaller proton-nucleus or larger nucleus-nucleus systems, measurements of centrality-selected high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ processes in O+O collisions are expected to be sensitive to selection bias effects, which will be necessary to quantify or mitigate before a definitive conclusion on the presence of jet quenching. Using two Monte Carlo heavy-ion event generators, we provide a survey of centrality bias effects on high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ yield and correlation measurements. Some highlights of our findings include that (1) bias factors for the accessible kinematic range at RHIC show a non-trivial $p_\mathrm{T}$ dependence, compared to a negligible one at the LHC given the smaller accessible Bjorken-$x$ range, (2) centrality definitions based on multiplicity are less sensitive to bias effects than those based on the transverse energy, (3) the Angantyr generator gives qualitatively similar but larger-magnitude bias factors than HIJING, and (4) correlation measurements have a much smaller sensitivity to bias effects than do yield measurements. The findings here are intended to guide the experimental design and interpretation of O+O jet quenching and other hard-process measurements.</description>

      <title>Does the Electron EDM Preclude Electroweak Baryogenesis ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. Using a specific model illustration, we show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints -- and thereby greater EWBG viability -- than implied by previous approximation formulations. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photon-fusion production of even-spin resonances and exotic QED atoms in high-energy hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross sections for the single exclusive production of (pseudo)scalar and (pseudo)tensor hadrons, as well as of even-spin QED bound states formed by pairs of opposite-charge leptons or hadrons, are estimated for photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus at the RHIC, LHC and FCC colliders, as well as in proton-air interactions at the highest energies reached by cosmic-rays impinging on Earth. The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onium, and B-onium) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) over $m_{\gamma\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC.</description>

      <title>New Types of Hydrogenlike matter Composed of Electron(s) and Meson(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we predict the existence of new types of hydrogenlike matter, including hydrogenlike atoms ($\pi^+e^-$, $K^+e^-$, $D^+e^-$), hydrogenlike molecular ions ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-$) and hydrogenlike molecules ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-e^-$). By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the binding energy of hydrogenlike atoms is obtained as $E_n=-\frac{1}{2n^2}$. For hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, the variational method is employed to calculate the binding energies, i.e., $E_+=-0.587$ and $E_0=-1.139$ for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, respectively. And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic units for convenience. In addition, the strong interaction between the two constituent mesons is considered in our calculations, where we find that its influence on the hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules can be neglected. Comparisons of hydrogenlike molecular ion and molecule with the systems governed by the strong interaction are made, which suggests the possible existence of doubly heavy triquark, hidden heavy-flavor tetraquarks and doubly heavy tetraquarks. Hopefully, these types of matter would be observed in the future with the improvement of accuracy in the high energy physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of the $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by density functional theory calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life of each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ one decays via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Isotope Production in Muon-Catalyzed-Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $\mu$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $\mu$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $\mu$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $\mu$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude relative to electricity-generating systems, making $\mu$CF an attractive high-flux neutron source. We show an example $\mu$CF system with a 10 gram ${}^{226}\mathrm{Ra}$ feedstock and a steady-state muon rate of $10^{12}$ muons / second - roughly half a kilowatt of fusion power - could produce 20 mg of ${}^{225}\mathrm{Ac}$ per year - comparable to 400 times global supply in 2024. As higher muon rate sources become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $\mu$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production far before net energy generation is possible.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>
