      <title>Ivancevic Option Pricing Model modulational instability through the variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instability of the Ivancevic option pricing model is studied through the variational method. We have analytically derived the dispersion relation of the IOPM for both constant volatility and Landau coefficient model and time-dependent volatility and Landau coefficient model. Also the IOPM was studies numerically using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete solitons in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the quasi-Riesz derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate a fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (FDNLS) equation based on an appropriately modified definition of the Riesz fractional derivative, which is characterized by its L\'{e}vy index (LI). This FDNLS equation represents a novel discrete system, in which the nearest-neighbor coupling is combined with long-range interactions, that decay as the inverse square of the separation between lattice sites. The system may be realized as an array of parallel quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of atoms or small molecules carrying, respectively, a permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment. The dispersion relation (DR) for lattice waves and the corresponding propagation band in the system's linear spectrum are found in an exact form for all values of LI. The DR is consistent with the continuum limit, differing in the range of wavenumbers. Formation of single-site and two-site discrete solitons is explored, starting from the anti-continuum limit and continuing the analysis in the numerical form up to the existence boundary of the discrete solitons. Stability of the solitons is identified in terms of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Mobility of the discrete solitons is considered too, by means of an estimate of the system's Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier, and with the help of direct simulations. Collisions between persistently moving discrete solitons are also studied.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the existence and stability dynamics of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential.
  We show that self-steepening solitons of the modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) equation undergo a position shift and amplitude increase during their evolution in the MNLS equation. The stabilization of solitons by an external potential is a challenging issue. This study demonstrates that the suppression of both the amplitude increase and the position shift of self-steepening solitons can be achieved by adding a periodic PT-symmetric potential to the MNLS equation.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability of Dissipative Solitons in a Dual-Waveguide Lattice with Linear Gain and Nonlinear Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the existence and stability of in-phase and out-of-phase dissipative solitons in a dual-waveguide lattice with linear localized gain and nonlinear losses under both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. Numerical results reveal that both types of dissipative solitons bifurcate from the linear amplified modes, and their nonlinear propagation constant changes to a real value when nonlinearity, linear localized gain, and nonlinear losses coexist. We find that increasing the linear gain coefficient leads to an increase in the power and propagation constant of both types of dissipative solitons. For defocusing nonlinearity, in-phase solitons are stable across their entire existence region, while focusing nonlinearity confines them to a small stable region near the lower cutoff value in the propagation constant. In contrast, out-of-phase solitons have a significantly larger stable region under focusing nonlinearity compared to defocusing nonlinearity. The stability regions of both types of dissipative solitons increase with increasing nonlinear losses coefficient. Additionally, we validate the results of linear stability analysis for dissipative solitons using propagation simulations, showing perfect agreement between the two methods.</description>
