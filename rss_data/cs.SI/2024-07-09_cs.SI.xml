      <title>Exploring agent interaction patterns in the comment sections of fake and real news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User comments on social media have been recognized as a crucial factor in distinguishing between fake and real news, with many studies focusing on the textual content of user reactions. However, the interactions among agents in the comment sections for fake and real news have not been fully explored. In this study, we analyze a dataset comprising both fake and real news from Reddit to investigate agent interaction patterns, considering both the network structure and the sentiment of the nodes. Our findings reveal that (i) comments on fake news are more likely to form groups, (ii) compared to fake news, where users generate more negative sentiment, real news tend to elicit more neutral and positive sentiments. Additionally, nodes with similar sentiments cluster together more tightly than anticipated. From a dynamic perspective, we found that the sentiment distribution among nodes stabilizes early and remains stable over time. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the early detection of real and fake news within social networks.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Datasets for Information Diffusion Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information diffusion across various new media platforms gradually influences perceptions, decisions, and social behaviors of individual users. In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</description>

      <title>Medfluencer: A Network Representation of Medical Influencers' Identities and Discourse on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our study, we first constructed a dataset from the tweets of the top 100 medical influencers with the highest Influencer Score during the COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset was then used to construct a socio-semantic network, mapping both their identities and key topics, which are crucial for understanding their impact on public health discourse. To achieve this, we developed a few-shot multi-label classifier to identify influencers and their network actors' identities, employed BERTopic for extracting thematic content, and integrated these components into a network model to analyze their impact on health discourse.</description>

      <title>Fractional Budget Allocation for Influence Maximization under General Marketing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fractional influence maximization problem, i.e., identifying users on a social network to be incentivized with potentially partial discounts to maximize the influence on the network. The larger the discount given to a user, the higher the likelihood of its activation (adopting a new product or innovation), who then attempts to activate its neighboring users, causing a cascade effect of influence through the network. Our goal is to devise efficient algorithms that assign initial discounts to the network's users to maximize the total number of activated users at the end of the cascade, subject to a constraint on the total sum of discounts given. In general, the activation likelihood could be any non-decreasing function of the discount, whereas, our focus lies on the case when the activation likelihood is an affine function of the discount, potentially varying across different users. As this problem is shown to be NP-hard, we propose and analyze an efficient (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we run experiments on real-world social networks to show the performance and scalability of our method.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Furball: A Practice Mapping Approach to the Analysis of Multimodal Interactions in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the analytical approach of practice mapping, using vector embeddings of network actions and interactions to map commonalities and disjunctures in the practices of social media users, as a framework for methodological advancement beyond the limitations of conventional network analysis and visualisation. In particular, the methodological framework we outline here has the potential to incorporate multiple distinct modes of interaction into a single practice map, can be further enriched with account-level attributes such as information gleaned from textual analysis, profile information, available demographic details, and other features, and can be applied even to a cross-platform analysis of communicative patterns and practices.
  The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter in order to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies. We illustrate the utility of the approach by applying it to a dataset where the application of conventional network analysis and visualisation approaches has produced few meaningful insights.</description>

      <title>WIBACong: An Argument-centric Framework for Understanding US Congressional Hearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we utilize state-of-the-art NLP tools to better understand legislative deliberation? Committee hearings are a core feature of any legislature, and they create an institutional setting to promote the exchange of arguments and reasoning that directly impact and shape legislation. We develop WIBACong, which is an application of the WIBA NLP framework for quantifying and qualifying the deliberation dynamics that we previously developed, applied to US Congressional Hearings. WIBA is a pipeline for extracting and analyzing argumentation communicated within text corpora, enabling a focused attention on the dynamics of debates occurring in democratic settings. With our framework, we are able to uncover the nuances of how deliberative discourse actually is. In WIBACong, we propose a variety of summary statistics and useful visualizations to the WIBA output in order to analyze argumentation in U.S. committee hearing testimony, and in so doing we reveal potential biases in the committee system, and how political parties control the flow of information in 'hot topic' hearings.</description>

      <title>Consistency and Discrepancy-Based Contrastive Tripartite Graph Learning for Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tripartite graph-based recommender systems markedly diverge from traditional models by recommending unique combinations such as user groups and item bundles. Despite their effectiveness, these systems exacerbate the longstanding cold-start problem in traditional recommender systems, because any number of user groups or item bundles can be formed among users or items. To address this issue, we introduce a Consistency and Discrepancy-based graph contrastive learning method for tripartite graph-based Recommendation. This approach leverages two novel meta-path-based metrics consistency and discrepancy to capture nuanced, implicit associations between the recommended objects and the recommendees. These metrics, indicative of high-order similarities, can be efficiently calculated with infinite graph convolutional networks layers under a multi-objective optimization framework, using the limit theory of GCN.</description>

      <title>Understanding Political Communication and Political Communicators on Twitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As new technologies rapidly reshape patterns of political communication, platforms like Twitch are transforming how people consume political information. This entertainment-oriented live streaming platform allows us to observe the impact of technologies such as ``live-streaming'' and ``streaming-chat'' on political communication. Despite its entertainment focus, Twitch hosts a variety of political actors, including politicians and pundits. This study explores Twitch politics by addressing three main questions: 1) Who are the political Twitch streamers? 2) What content is covered in political streams? 3) How do audiences of political streams interact with each other? To identify political streamers, I leveraged the Twitch API and supervised machine-learning techniques, identifying 574 political streamers. I used topic modeling to analyze the content of political streams, revealing seven broad categories of political topics and a unique pattern of communication involving context-specific ``emotes.'' Additionally, I created user-reference networks to examine interaction patterns, finding that a small number of users dominate the communication network. This research contributes to our understanding of how new social media technologies influence political communication, particularly among younger audiences.</description>

      <title>New Directions in Text Classification Research: Maximizing The Performance of Sentiment Classification from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stakeholders' needs in sentiment analysis for various issues, whether positive or negative, are speed and accuracy. One new challenge in sentiment analysis tasks is the limited training data, which often leads to suboptimal machine learning models and poor performance on test data. This paper discusses the problem of text classification based on limited training data (300 to 600 samples) into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. A benchmark dataset is provided for training and testing data on the issue of Kaesang Pangarep's appointment as Chairman of PSI. External data for aggregation and augmentation purposes are provided, consisting of two datasets: the topic of Covid Vaccination sentiment and an open topic. The official score used is the F1-score, which balances precision and recall among the three classes, positive, negative, and neutral. A baseline score is provided as a reference for researchers for unoptimized classification methods. The optimized score is provided as a reference for the target score to be achieved by any proposed method. Both scoring (baseline and optimized) use the SVM method, which is widely reported as the state-of-the-art in conventional machine learning methods. The F1-scores achieved by the baseline and optimized methods are 40.83% and 51.28%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiplexity is temporal: effects of social times on network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale social networks constructed using contact metadata have been invaluable tools for understanding and testing social theories of society-wide social structures. However, multiplex relationships explaining different social contexts have been out of reach of this methodology, limiting our ability to understand this crucial aspect of social systems. We propose a method that infers latent social times from the weekly activity of large-scale contact metadata, and reconstruct multilayer networks where layers correspond to social times. We then analyze the temporal multiplexity of ties in a society-wide communication network of millions of individuals. This allows us to test the propositions of Feld's social focus theory across a society-wide network: We show that ties favour their own social times regardless of contact intensity, suggesting they reflect underlying social foci. We present a result on strength of monoplex ties, which indicates that monoplex ties are bridging and even more important for global network connectivity than the weak, low-contact ties. Finally, we show that social times are transitive, so that when egos use a social time for a small subset of alters, the alters use the social time among themselves as well. Our framework opens up a way to analyse large-scale communication as multiplex networks and uncovers society-level patterns of multiplex connectivity.</description>

      <title>To be a pro-vax or not, the COVID-19 vaccine conundrum on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most surprising observation reported by the study in (arXiv:2208.13523), involving stance detection of COVID-19 vaccine related tweets during the first year of pandemic, is the presence of a significant number of users (~2 million) who posted tweets with both anti-vax and pro-vax stances. This is a sizable cohort even when the stance detection noise is considered. In this paper, we tried to get deeper understanding of this 'dual-stance' group. Out of this group, 60% of users have more pro-vax tweets than anti-vax tweets and 17% have the same number of tweets in both classes. The rest have more anti-vax tweets, and they were highly active in expressing concerns about mandate and safety of a fast-tracked vaccine, while also tweeted some updates about vaccine development. The leaning pro-vax group have opposite composition: more vaccine updates and some posts about concerns. It is important to note that vaccine concerns were not always genuine and had a large dose of misinformation. 43% of the balanced group have only tweeted one tweet of each type during our study period and are the less active participants in the vaccine discourse. Our temporal study also shows that the change-of-stance behaviour became really significant once the trial results of COVID-19 vaccine were announced to the public, and it appears as the change of stance towards pro-vax is a reaction to people changing their opinion towards anti-vax. Our study finished at Mar 23, 2021 when the conundrum was still going strong. The dilemma might be a reflection of the uncertain and stressful times, but it also highlights the importance of building public trust to combat prevalent misinformation.</description>

      <title>BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. We propose a simple surrogate function to model the objective function and leverage Gaussian Process regression with shrinkage priors to fit the model. A major difficulty in combinatorial BO is constructing an appropriate covariance matrix. We overcome this challenge with a kernel function based on the amount of overlap in seed set neighbors, thus tailoring the solution to our IM application. This also allows us to use the Expected Improvement acquisition function to choose the next point to evaluate. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as five times faster. We also demonstrate the proposed method's ability to quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: International trading networks significantly influence global economic conditions and environmental outcomes. A notable imbalance between economic gains and emissions transfers persists, manifesting as carbon inequality. This study introduces a novel metric, the Ecological Economic Equality Index, integrated with complex network dynamics analysis, to quantitatively evaluate the evolving roles within the global trading network and to pinpoint inequities in trade relationships from 1995 to 2022. Utilising high spatiotemporal resolution data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-regional Input-output model, our findings reveal a widening disparity in carbon inequality and dynamic patterns. This analysis emphasises the gap in regional carbon inequality and identifies unequal trade. The study underscores that carbon inequality is a critical challenge affecting both developing and developed regions, demanding widespread attention and action.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Graph-Based Fraud Detection in Sight of Heterophily and Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based fraud detection (GFD) can be regarded as a challenging semi-supervised node binary classification task. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been widely applied to GFD, characterizing the anomalous possibility of a node by aggregating neighbor information. However, fraud graphs are inherently heterophilic, thus most of GNNs perform poorly due to their assumption of homophily. In addition, due to the existence of heterophily and class imbalance problem, the existing models do not fully utilize the precious node label information. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a semi-supervised GNN-based fraud detector SEC-GFD. This detector includes a hybrid filtering module and a local environmental constraint module, the two modules are utilized to solve heterophily and label utilization problem respectively. The first module starts from the perspective of the spectral domain, and solves the heterophily problem to a certain extent. Specifically, it divides the spectrum into various mixed-frequency bands based on the correlation between spectrum energy distribution and heterophily. Then in order to make full use of the node label information, a local environmental constraint module is adaptively designed. The comprehensive experimental results on four real-world fraud detection datasets denote that SEC-GFD outperforms other competitive graph-based fraud detectors. We release our code at https://github.com/Sunxkissed/SEC-GFD.</description>

Abstract: To improve the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), several multi-agent approaches have been introduced. While these methods enhance performance, the application of collective intelligence-based approaches to complex network structures and the dynamics of agent interactions remain underexplored. This work extends the concept of multi-agent debate to more general network topologies, measuring the question-answering accuracy, influence, consensus, and the effects of bias on the collective. The results show that random networks perform similarly to fully connected networks despite using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, a strong consensus among agents correlates with correct answers, whereas divided responses typically indicate incorrect answers. Analysing the influence of the agents reveals a balance between self-reflection and interconnectedness; self-reflection aids when local interactions are incorrect, and local interactions aid when the agent itself is incorrect. Additionally, bias plays a strong role in system performance with correctly biased hub nodes boosting performance. These insights suggest that using random networks or scale-free networks with knowledgeable agents placed in central positions can enhance the overall question-answering performance of multi-agent systems.</description>
