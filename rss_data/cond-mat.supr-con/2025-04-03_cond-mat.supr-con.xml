      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological phases for time-reversal-symmetry breaking superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has broadened the possibility of realizing exotic time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity. However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Fully-gapped superconductivity with rotational symmetry breaking in pressurized kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \sim$ 0.4 $T_\textrm{c}$ within the superconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\rm c} \sim 1.85$ GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$ shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly, even faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above $P_{\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P &gt; P_{\rm c}$ which explains both the 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\rm c2}$ behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric AC Josephson effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temperature gradient ${\Delta}T$ across a Josephson junction induces a thermoelectric current. We predict the AC Josephson effect is activated when this current surpasses the junction's critical current. Our investigation of this phenomenon employs the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory framework in proximity to the critical temperature. Our results indicate that the frequency of the AC current is approximately given by ${\pi} S {\Delta} T / (2 {\Phi}_0)$, where $S$ represents the Seebeck coefficient and ${\Phi}_0$ the magnetic flux quantum and we estimate the frequency be on the range of GHz for Sn up to a THz for larger $S$ and $T_c$ materials. Furthermore, we propose two distinct experimental configurations to observe this effect.</description>

      <title>Control of Andreev Reflection via a Single-Molecule Orbital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transport across a single-molecule junction fabricated from a normal-metal tip, a phthalocyanine, and a conventional superconductor in a scanning tunneling microscope is explored as a function of the gradually closed vacuum gap. The phthalocyanine (2H-Pc) molecule and its pyrrolichydrogen-abstracted derivative (Pc) exhibit vastly different behavior. Andreev reflection across the 2H-Pc contact exhibits a temporary enhancement that diminishes with increasing conductance. The hybridization of 2H-Pc with the tip at contact formation gives rise to a Kondo-screened molecular magnetic moment. In contrast, the single-Pc junction lacks Andreev reflection in the same conductance range. Spectroscopies and supporting nonequilibrium Green function calculations highlight the importance of a molecular orbital close to the Fermi energy for Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</description>

      <title>Superconductivity up to 17 K in the high-pressure rhombohedral-I phase of ReO3: a potential oxide analogy of hydride superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6 octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase in the pressure range of 12-39 GPa is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase, and it shows a dome-shaped Tc(P) with a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of states at Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nematic quantum disordered state in FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unusual quantum-disordered magnetic ground state intertwined with superconductivity and electronic nematicity in FeSe has been a research focus in iron-based superconductors. However, the intrinsic spin excitations across the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to $E\approx120$ meV, while the N{\'e}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their $C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the N\'eel excitations in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the N\'eel excitations are driven by the enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, N\'eel, and stripe ordering regimes. The results provide an experimental basis for establishing a microscopic theoretical model to describe the origin and intertwining of the emergent orders in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</description>

      <title>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</description>
