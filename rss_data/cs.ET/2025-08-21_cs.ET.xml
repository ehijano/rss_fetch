      <title>Q-BEAST: A Practical Course on Experimental Evaluation and Characterization of Quantum Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises to be a transformative technology with impact on various application domains, such as optimization, cryptography, and material science. However, the technology has a sharp learning curve, and practical evaluation and characterization of quantum systems remains complex and challenging, particularly for students and newcomers from computer science to the field of quantum computing. To address this educational gap, we introduce Q-BEAST, a practical course designed to provide structured training in the experimental analysis of quantum computing systems. Q-BEAST offers a curriculum that combines foundational concepts in quantum computing with practical methodologies and use cases for benchmarking and performance evaluation on actual quantum systems. Through theoretical instruction and hands-on experimentation, students gain experience in assessing the advantages and limitations of real quantum technologies. With that, Q-BEAST supports the education of a future generation of quantum computing users and developers. Furthermore, it also explicitly promotes a deeper integration of High Performance Computing (HPC) and QC in research and education.</description>

      <title>PAPPL: Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid, standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements, impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL) platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable, data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o, a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.</description>

      <title>Trace-Based Reconstruction of Quantum Circuit Dataflow in Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics, advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy updating and policy execution. On the one hand, a single value evaluation network limits the policy updating in complex scenarios with coupled driving objectives. On the other hand, the common single-type action space structure limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, an advanced MORL architecture is constructed, in which the ensemble-critic focuses on different objectives through independent reward functions. The architecture integrates a hybrid parameterized action space structure, and the generated driving actions contain both abstract guidance that matches the hybrid road modality and concrete control commands. Additionally, an uncertainty-based exploration mechanism that supports hybrid actions is developed to learn multi-objective compatible policies more quickly. Experimental results demonstrate that, in both simulator-based and HighD dataset-based multi-lane highway scenarios, our method efficiently learns multi-objective compatible autonomous driving with respect to efficiency, action consistency, and safety.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%.</description>

      <title>KIRETT: Knowledge-Graph-Based Smart Treatment Assistant for Intelligent Rescue Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the situation.</description>
