      <title>Comparison of Mathematical Models for Subscription Services Using Optimization Problems and Quantum Information Theory -Feasibility of Implementing Optimization Problem Algorithms on Quantum Computers-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this research is to explore whether it is possible to construct a design theory for subscription services for intangible goods from a time discounting perspective, based on quantum information theory, which is the foundational theory for quantum computers and similar technologies. To this end, we propose a mathematical model of subscription services using optimization problems based on optimal growth theory from standard economics, and with reference to microeconomics, we define utility as a value function of customer satisfaction derived from quantum mutual information, an entropy measure in quantum information theory, by considering time discounting. We propose the quantification of customer satisfaction and the formulation of consumer surplus. In the mathematical model of subscription services, the existence of a minimum value in the time-discounted customer satisfaction value function under budget constraints, and the realization of a mathematical expression for consumer surplus, could be explained by the laws of behavioral economics. This yielded new insights into the design of individually customized customer experiences, enhanced the feasibility of constructing economic models based on quantum information theory and the mathematical design of customer experiences, raised the possibility that mathematical models using quantum information theory can achieve greater economic welfare than standard economics, and increased the feasibility of implementing optimization problem algorithms on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>An analytical and experimental study of the energy transition discourse on YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy production and management face significant political, economic, and environmental challenges, yet the rise in information consumption through social media undermines the availability of reliable knowledge to the general public. This study examines the ideas discussed in the energy transition content on YouTube, assesses the most effective methods of communicating knowledge and information to the general public, and identifies the most engaged audiences. We examine videos related to the subject, analysing the themes discussed, the language used, and the emotions conveyed on YouTube, linking language formality to user engagement. To test the relationship experimentally, we uploaded original content to YouTube through two mirror channels containing the same material but using different levels of language formality. Our results indicate that conversational content reaches a broader audience, but retention rates are higher on the academic channel beyond the initial video segments. Interest in the topic varies by viewer profile, with younger individuals and women showing greater engagement regardless of language style.</description>

      <title>Disparity-in-Differences: Extracting Hierarchical Backbones of Weighted Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are useful representations for complex systems. Especially, heterogeneous and asymmetrical relations commonly found in complex systems can be converted to weighted directed edges between nodes. The disparity filter (Serrano et al., 2009) has successfully extracted backbones, sets of important edges, from empirical networks but is not designed to incorporate node-node dependency that may encode hierarchical relations. This paper proposes an extended disparity filter named "disparity-in-differences" that assigns a synthetic relation between two nodes if one depends relatively more on the other where the extent of asymmetric dependence is measured by the disparity between a normalized edge weight difference and an expected edge weight difference. For evaluation, the proposed method is applied to a journal citation network, a U.S. airport network, the Enron email network, and a world trade network. Compared to the disparity filter, the proposed approach better captures hierarchical relations that align well with journal quality ratings, airport hub categories by size, levels of management, and a core-periphery structure of countries, respectively.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Writing Is Growing Fastest Among Non-English-Speaking and Less Established Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominance of English in global science has long created significant barriers for non-native speakers. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) dramatically reduces drafting and revision costs, but, simultaneously, raises a critical question: how is the technology being adopted by the global scientific community, and is it mitigating existing inequities? This study provides first large-scale empirical evidence by analyzing over two million full-text biomedical publications from PubMed Central from 2021 to 2024, estimating the fraction of AI-generated content using a distribution-based framework. We observe a significant post-ChatGPT surge in AI-assisted writing, with adoption growing fastest in contexts where language barriers are most pronounced: approximately 400% in non-English-speaking countries compared to 183% in English-speaking countries. This adoption is highest among less-established scientists, including those with fewer publications and citations, as well as those in early career stages at lower-ranked institutions. Prior AI research experience also predicted higher adoption. Finally, increased AI usage was associated with a modest increase in productivity, narrowing the publication gap between scientists from English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries with higher levels of AI adoption. These findings provide large-scale evidence that generative AI is being adopted unevenly, reflecting existing structural disparities while also offering a potential opportunity to mitigate long-standing linguistic inequalities.</description>

      <title>Candidate Voter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model dynamically changing candidate positions in the face of a dynamic electorate. To formulate our equations, we use a space-time-continuous Hegselmann-Krause equation, which we solve using a particle method. We use the combined candidate-voter model to demonstrate the possibility of discontinuous jumps in candidate behavior as parameters of the model are varied. We also extend the analysis to a three candidate scenario. We observe that depending on the parameters, candidates do not always come or stay together at their dynamically evolving position.</description>

      <title>Modeling temporal hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks representing social, biological, technological or other systems are often characterized by higher-order interaction involving any number of nodes. Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs and to test and control for complex dependencies in hypergraph dynamics. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>

      <title>Increasing competitiveness by imbalanced groups: The example of the 48-team FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A match played in a sports tournament can be called stakeless if at least one team is indifferent to its outcome because it already has qualified or has been eliminated. Such a game threatens fairness since teams may not exert full effort without incentives. This paper suggests a novel classification for stakeless matches based on their expected outcome: they are more costly if the indifferent team is more likely to win by playing honestly. Our approach is illustrated with the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the first edition of the competition with 48 teams. We propose a novel format based on imbalanced groups, which substantially reduces the probability of stakeless matches played by the strongest teams according to Monte Carlo simulations. The new design also increases the uncertainty of match outcomes and requires fewer matches. Governing bodies in sports are encouraged to consider our innovative idea in order to enhance the competitiveness of their tournaments.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Contact Patterns in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how age-specific social contact patterns and susceptibility influence infectious disease transmission is crucial for accurate epidemic modeling. This study presents an eigenvector-based sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of age-structured interactions on disease spread. By applying perturbation analysis to the Next Generation Matrix, we reformulate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, as a generalized eigenproblem, enabling the identification of key age group interactions that drive transmission. Using real-world COVID-19 contact data from Hungary, we demonstrate the framework's ability to highlight critical transmission pathways. We compare these findings with results obtained earlier using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we extend the analysis to contact structures in the UK and British Columbia, Canada, providing broader epidemiological insights. This work enhances our understanding of demographic interactions in epidemic propagation and offers a robust methodological foundation for improving infectious disease modeling and informing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Who is using AI to code? Global diffusion and impact of generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative coding tools promise big productivity gains, but uneven uptake could widen skill and income gaps. We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in over 30 million GitHub commits by 170,000 developers, tracking how fast -- and where -- these tools take hold. Today, AI writes an estimated 29% of Python functions in the US, a modest and shrinking lead over other countries. We estimate that quarterly output, measured in online code contributions, has increased by 3.6% because of this. Our evidence suggests that programmers using AI may also more readily expand into new domains of software development. However, experienced programmers capture nearly all of these productivity and exploration gains, widening rather than closing the skill gap.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a large variety of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering and comparing centrality measures.</description>
