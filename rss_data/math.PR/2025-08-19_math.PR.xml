      <title>Phase transition on randomly horizontally stretched square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a bond percolation model on a horizontally stretched square lattice, constructed by stretching the distances between the columns of $\mathbb{Z}_+^2$ according to a collection of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a non-negative random variable $\xi$. We assume that $\xi$ satisfies the integrability condition \[ \mathbb{E}\big[\xi\, e^{c(\log \xi)^{1/2}} \,\mathbb{1}_{\{\xi \geq 1\}}\big] &lt; \infty, \] for some constant $c &gt; 8\sqrt{\log 96}$. In this random environment, each vertical edge is independently declared open with probability $p$, while each horizontal edge is open with probability $p^{|e|}$, where $|e|$ denotes the Euclidean length of the edge. We develop a multiscale renormalization scheme adapted to this geometry and use it to prove that percolation occurs for all sufficiently large values of $p &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Sharp upper bounds on hitting probabilities for the solution to the stochastic heat equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Gaussian random fields with values in $\mathbb{R}^d$, sharp upper and lower bounds on the probability of hitting a fixed set have been available for many years. These apply in particular to the solutions of systems of linear SPDEs. For non-Gaussian random fields, the available bounds are less sharp. For nonlinear systems of stochastic heat equations, a sharp lower bound was obtained in a previous paper by two of the authors. Here, we obtain the corresponding sharp upper bound. The proof requires a bound on the joint probability density function of a two-dimensional random vector whose components are the solution to the {\em nonlinear} stochastic heat equation and the supremum over a small rectangle of the solution to the {\em linear} stochastic heat equation, in terms of the size of the rectangle. This bound makes use of a formula that expresses the density of a {\em locally nondegenerate} random vector as an iterated Skorohod integral. The main effort is to estimate, using Malliavin calculus, each of the terms that arise from this formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rather sharp two-side estimate for the tail probability of the derivative martingale limit in a branching random walk throughout the entire subcritical regime, confirming a conjecture by Lacoin, Rhodes, and Vargas (\emph{Duke Math.

      <description>arXiv:2508.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for a class of Crump Mode Jagers continuous time branching processes, where the birth rate is age dependent, and also random (different from one individual to the next), in the limit of a large number of ancestors. The only difficulty concerns the tightness in the Skorohod space $D$ for the central limit theorem. We exploit a criterion for the CLT in $D$ due to M. Hahn \cite{MH}.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed.This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a sufficient (non-Gaussian) affine-ergodic-interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\textsf{AR}(p)$ and $\textsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means.</description>

      <title>Sub-Poisson distributions: Concentration inequalities, optimal variance proxies, and closure properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonasymptotic framework for sub-Poisson distributions with moment generating function dominated by that of a Poisson distribution. At its core is a new notion of optimal sub-Poisson variance proxy, analogous to the variance parameter in the sub-Gaussian setting. This framework allows us to derive a Bennett-type concentration inequality without boundedness assumptions and to show that the sub-Poisson property is closed under key operations including independent sums and convex combinations, but not under all linear operations such as scalar multiplication. We derive bounds relating the sub-Poisson variance proxy to sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential Orlicz norms. Taken together, these results unify the treatment of Bernoulli and Poisson random variables and their signed versions in their natural tail regime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shift the perspective on the interval fragmentation problem from division points to division spacings. This leads to a proof that is both simpler and stronger, establishing limiting distributions for partition points and spacings and, more importantly, including large-deviation error bounds. Moreover, the approach is general. We derive the limiting spacing distribution for arbitrary division points, and claim it is independent of splitting scheme. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the limiting partition points are always uniformly distributed. Discrete case (heavy-tailed probability densities of division points) is investigated and new results are presented, such as the stage-wise progression of fragmentation process. The results obtained apply to random trees.</description>

      <title>Kinetic SDEs with subcritical distributional drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness of the kinetic stochastic differential equation (SDE) in $\mathbb R^{2d}(d\geq2)$ driven by Brownian motion: $$\mathord{{\rm d}} X_t=V_t\mathord{{\rm d}} t,\ \mathord{{\rm d}} V_t=b(t,X_t,V_t)\mathord{{\rm d}} t+\sqrt{2}\mathord{{\rm d}} W_t,$$ where the subcritical distribution-valued drift $b$ belongs to the weighted anisotropic H\"{o}lder space $\mathbb L_T^{q_b}\mathbf C_{\boldsymbol{a}}^{\alpha_b}(\rho_\kappa)$ with parameters $\alpha_b\in(-1,0)$, $q_b\in(\frac{2}{1+\alpha_b},\infty]$, $\kappa\in[0,1+\alpha_b)$ and $\div_v b$ is bounded. We establish the well-posedness of weak solutions to the associated integral equation: $$X_t=X_0+\int_0^t V_s\mathord{{\rm d}} s,\ V_t=V_0+\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^t b_n(s,X_s,V_s)\mathord{{\rm d}}+\sqrt{2}W_t,$$ where $b_n:=b*\Gamma_n$ denotes the mollification of $b$ and the limit is taken in the $L^2$-sense. As an application, we discuss examples of $b$ involving Gaussian random fields.</description>

      <title>On the Fitness Landscape in the $NK$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $NK$ model, introduced by Kauffman, Levin, and Weinberger, is a random field used to describe the fitness landscape of certain species with $N$ genetic loci, each interacting with $K$ others. The model has wide applications in understanding evolutionary and natural selection as it captures ruggedness feature of the fitness landscape. Earlier literature has been focused on the case $K$ being a fixed positive integer and used tools from Ergodic and Markov theory. In this paper, by viewing it as a statistical physics object, we investigate the $NK$ model in the regime $K/N\to\alpha \in(0,1]$ via the spin glass methodologies. Our main result identifies the exact limits for the free energy at any temperature and the maximum fitness. Moreover, we show that the $NK$ model exhibits a multiple-peak structure, namely, the number of near-fittest genomes that are asymptotically orthogonal to each other is exponentially large. Based on establishing the overlap gap properties, we obtain quantitative descriptions for the geometry of the fitness landscape and deduce that, in particular, near-fittest evolutionary paths become impossible as the fitness levels of the genomes approach the global maximum for any $\alpha\in (0,1]$. Nevertheless, we also show that by choosing $\alpha$ sufficiently small, an evolutionary path maintained at a given fitness level can be constructed with high probability.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Nonlinear Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the mean field stochastic partial differential equations with nonlinear kernels. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of strong and weak solutions for mean field stochastic partial differential equations in the variational framework, then establish the convergence (in certain Wasserstein metric) of the empirical laws of interacting systems to the law of solutions of mean field equations, as the number of particles tends to infinity. The main challenge lies in addressing the inherent interplay between the high nonlinearity of operators and the non-local effect of coefficients that depend on the measure. In particular, we do not need to assume any exponential moment control condition of solutions, which extends the range of the applicability of our results.
  As applications, we first study a class of finite-dimensional interacting particle systems with polynomial kernels, which are commonly encountered in fields such as the data science and the machine learning. Subsequently, we present several illustrative examples of infinite-dimensional interacting systems with nonlinear kernels, such as the stochastic climate models, the stochastic Allen-Cahn equations, and the stochastic Burgers type equations.</description>

      <title>An interesting spectral gap problem, from Jim Fill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the request of Laszlo Babai, founder and an editor of the free online journal Theory of Computing (ToC), theoryofcomputing.org, in August, 2025, I am posting on the arXiv, essentially unedited and not updated, a combination of two closely related sets of unpublished notes from 2003. ToC is keen on publishing links to all bibliography items, and a paper soon to be published there makes progress on a conjecture in my 2003 notes. The sections "The problem", "Evidence in favor of the conjecture", "Facts about the spectral structure of the matrix $K$", and "Stronger conjectures" previously formed a document entitled "An interesting spectral gap problem, from Jim Fill". The sections "Introduction: Self-organizing lists" and "The move-ahead-$1$ (MA1) rule" formed a document entitled "Background on the gap problem". The two sets of notes have inspired some research, including (as one example, with no attempt here at a literature survey) a 2022 paper by Bhakta, Miracle, Randall, and Streib cited in this arXiv document.</description>

      <title>Monotone tail functions: definitions, properties, and application to risk-reducing strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies properties of functions having monotone tails. We extend Theorem 1 of Dhaene et al. (2002a) and show how the tail quantiles of a random variable transformed with a monotone tail function can be expressed as the transformed tail quantiles of the original random variable. The main result is intuitive, in that Dhaene et al. (2002a) properties still hold, but only for certain quantile values. However, the proof presents some complications that arise especially when the function involved has discontinuities. We consider different situations where monotone tail functions occur and can be use ful, such as the evaluation of the payoff of option trading strategies and the present value of insurance contracts providing both death and survival benefits. The paper also applies monotone tail functions to study quadrant perfect dependence, and shows how this depen dence structure integrates within the framework of monotone tail functions. Moreover, we apply the theory to the problem of risk reduction and investigate conditions on a hedger ensuring efficient reductions of required economic capital.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations of last passage percolation with thick boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the exponential last passage percolation (LPP) with thick two-sided boundary that consists of a few inhomogeneous columns and rows. Ben Arous and Corwin previously studied the limit fluctuations in this model except in a critical regime, for which they predicted that the limit distribution exists and depends only on the most dominant columns and rows. In this article, we prove their conjecture and identify the limit distribution explicitly in terms of a Fredholm determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel. This result leads in particular to an explicit variational formula for the one-point marginal of the KPZ fixed point for a new class of initial conditions. Our limit distribution is also a novel generalization of and provides a new numerically efficient representation for the Baik--Rains distribution.</description>

      <title>Law of the iterated logarithm for supercritical non-local spatial branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $X=(X_{t})_{t\ge 0}$ is either a general supercritical non-local branching Markov process, or a general supercritical non-local superprocess, on a Luzin space. Here, by ``supercritical" we mean that the mean semigroup of $X$ exhibits a Perron-Frobenius type behaviour with a positive principal eigenvalue. In this paper, we study the almost sure behaviour of a family of martingales naturally associated with the real or complex-valued eigenpairs of the mean semigroup. Under a fourth-moment condition, we establish limit theorems of the iterated logarithm type for these martingales. In particular, we discover three regimes, each resulting in different scaling factors and limits. Furthermore, we obtain a law of the iterated logarithm for the linear functional $\langle \mathrm{Re}(f),X_{t}\rangle$ where $f$ is a sum of finite terms of eigenfunctions and $\mathrm{Re}(f)$ denotes its real part. In the context of branching Markov processes, our results improve on existing literature by complementing the known results for multitype branching processes in Asmussen [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 231 (1) (1977) 233--248] and generalizing the recent work of Hou, Ren and Song [arXiv: 2505.12691] to allow for non-local branching mechanism and non-symmetric spatial motion. For superprocesses, as far as we know, our results are new.</description>

      <title>Taming Irrationality: An Invariance Principle for the Random Billiard Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random billiard walk is a stochastic process $(L_t)_{t\geq 0}$ in which a laser moves through the Coxeter arrangement of an affine Weyl group in $\mathbb{R}^d$, reflecting at each hyperplane with probability $p\in (0, 1)$ and transmitting unchanged otherwise. Defant, Jiradilok, and Mossel introduced this process from the perspective of algebraic combinatorics and established that, for initial directions aligned with the coroot lattice, $L_t/\sqrt{t}$ converges to a centered spherical Gaussian. We bring analytic tools from ergodic theory and probability to the problem and extend this central limit theorem to all initial directions. More strongly, we prove the rescaled trajectories $t\mapsto n^{-1/2}L_{tn}$ converge to isotropic Brownian motion. Away from directions with rational dependencies, the limiting covariance varies continuously in $p$ and the initial direction.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-scaled strong convergence of stochastic theta method for stochastic differential equations driven by time-changed L\'evy noise beyond Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an $\alpha$-parametrized framework for analyzing the strong convergence of the stochastic theta (ST) method for stochastic differential equations driven by time-changed L\'evy noise (TCSDEwLNs) with time-space-dependent coefficients satisfying local Lipschitz conditions. Properties of the inverse subordinator are investigated and explicit moment bounds for the exact solution are derived with jump rate incorporated. The analysis demonstrates that the ST method converges strongly with order of $min\{\eta_{F},\eta_{G},\eta_{H},\alpha/2\}$, establishing a precise relationship between numerical accuracy and the time-change mechanism. This theoretical advancement extends existing results and would facilitate applications in finance and biology where time-changed L\'evy models are prevalent.</description>

      <title>Benford behavior resulting from stick and box fragmentation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benford's law is the statement that in many real world data sets, the probability of having digit $d$ in base $B$, where $1 \leq d \leq B$, as the first digit is \log_{B}\!\left(\frac{d+1}{d}\right). We sometimes refer to this as weak Benford behavior, and we say that a data set exhibits strong Benford behavior in base $B$ if the probability of having significand at most s, where $1 \leq s &lt; B$, is \log_{B}\!\left(s\right). We examine Benford behaviors in two different probabilistic models: stick and box fragmentation. Building on the work by arXiv:1309.5603 on the one-dimensional stick fragmentation model, we employ combinatorial identities on multinomial coefficients to reduce the high-dimensional stick fragmentation model to the one-dimensional model and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the lengths of the stick fragments to converge to strong Benford behavior. Then we answer a conjecture by arXiv:2304.08335 on the high-dimensional box fragmentation model. Using tools from order statistics, we prove that under some mild conditions, faces of any arbitrary dimension of the box have total volume converging to strong Benford behavior.</description>

      <title>On the central limit question for strictly stationary, reversible Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will provide several classes of strictly stationary, countable-state, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chains that are reversible and have finite second moments, such that the central limit theorem fails to hold. The main purpose is to examine the extent to which, for the development of central limit theory for strictly stationary Markov chains (and functions of them) under the strong mixing and absolute regularity conditions, the property of reversibility (if it holds) can provide extra leverage. It is known, partly as a by-product of research done by Roberts, Rosenthal, and Tweedie in two papers in 1997 and 2001, that for the case of exponential mixing rates, reversibility provides notable extra leverage of that kind. In contrast, a class of counterexamples in a paper of Doukhan, Massart, and Rio in 1994 showed (implicitly) that for the case of power-type mixing rates, reversibility apparently provides almost no such extra leverage. Further perspective on that latter fact will be provided by some counterexamples in this paper. Other counterexamples here will (indirectly) provide some tentative, uncertain evidence for the possibility that for mixing rates that are ``between'' power-type and exponential (for example, sub-exponential), reversibility may in fact provide some small but nontrivial extra leverage.</description>

      <title>The Leibenson process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Leibenson equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u = \Delta_p u^q, \end{equation*} where $\Delta_p f = div(|\nabla f|^{p-2}\nabla f)$ for $p&gt;1$ and $q&gt;0$, which is a simultaneous generalization of the porous media and the $p$-Laplace equation. In this paper we identify the Leibenson equation as a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation and prove that it has a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean as its probabilistic counterpart. More precisely, we obtain a probabilistic representation of its Barenblatt solutions as the one-dimensional marginal density curve of the unique solutions to the associated McKean--Vlasov SDE. The latter is of novel type, since its coefficients depend pointwise both on its solution's time marginal densities and also on their first and second order derivatives. Moreover, we show that these solutions constitute the aforementioned nonlinear Markov process, which we call the Leibenson process. A further main result of this work is to prove that despite the strong degeneracy of the diffusion and the irregularity of the drift coefficient (which is merely of bounded variation) of the McKean--Vlasov SDE these solutions are probabilistically strong, i.e., measurable functionals of the driving Brownian motion and the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling of Filtration with Sieving in Graded Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model filtration of a feed solution, containing both small and large foulant particles, by a membrane filter. The membrane interior is modeled as a network of pores, allowing for the simultaneous adsorption of small particles and sieving of large particles, two fouling mechanisms typically observed during the early stages of commercial filtration applications. In our model, first-principles continuum partial differential equations model transport of the small particles and adsorptive fouling in each pore, while sieving particles are assumed to follow a discrete Poisson arrival process with a biased random walk through the pore network. Our goals are to understand the relative influences of each fouling mode and highlight the effect of their coupling on the performance of filters with a pore-size gradient (specifically, we consider a banded filter with different pore sizes in each band). Our results suggest that, due to the discrete nature of pore blockage, sieving alters qualitatively the rate of the flux decline. Moreover, the difference between sieving particle sizes and the initial pore size (radius) in each band plays a crucial role in indicating the onset and disappearance of sieving-adsorption competition. Lastly, we demonstrate a phase transition in the filter lifetime as the arrival frequency of sieving particles increases.</description>

      <title>Does the Barron space really defy the curse of dimensionality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barron space has become famous in the theory of (shallow) neural networks because it seemingly defies the curse of dimensionality. And while the Barron space (and generalizations) indeed defies (defy) the curse of dimensionality from the POV of classical smoothness, we herein provide some evidence in favor of the idea that the Barron space (and generalizations) does (do) not defy the curse of dimensionality with a nonclassical notion of smoothness which relates naturally to "infinitely wide" shallow neural networks. Like how the Bessel potential spaces are defined via the Fourier transform, we define so-called ADZ spaces via the Mellin transform; these ADZ spaces encapsulate the nonclassical smoothness we alluded to earlier.

      <title>Dependence bounds for the difference of stop-loss payoffs on the difference of two random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the difference of stop-loss payoffs where the underlying is a difference of two random variables. The goal is to study whether the comonotonic and countermonotonic modifications of those two random variables can be used to construct upper and lower bounds for the expected payoff, despite the fact that the payoff function is neither convex nor concave. The answer to the central question of the paper requires studying the crossing points of the cdf of the original difference with the cdfs of its comonotonic and countermonotonic transforms. The analysis is supplemented with a numerical study of longevity trend bonds, using different mortality models and population data. The numerical study reveals that for these mortality-linked securities the three pairs of cdfs generally have unique pairwise crossing points. Under symmetric copulas, all crossing points can reasonably be approximated by the difference of the marginal medians, but this approximation is not necessarily valid for asymmetric copulas. Nevertheless, extreme dependence structures can give rise to bounds if the layers of the bond are selected to hedge tail risk. Further, the dependence uncertainty spread can be low if the layers are selected to hedge median risk, and, subject to a trade-off, to hedge tail risk as well.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Type Operator Deformed by Generalized Fibonacci Numbers and Its Combinatorial Moment Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter deformation of the classical Poisson distribution from the viewpoint of noncommutative probability theory, by defining a $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator (random variable) on the $(q,t)$-Fock space \cite{Bl12} (See also \cite{BY06, AY20}). From the analogous viewpoint of the classical Poisson limit theorem in probability theory, we are naturally led to a family of orthogonal polynomials, which we call the $(q,t)$-Charlier polynomials. These generalize the $q$-Charlier polynomials of Saitoh-Yoshida \cite{SY00a, SY00b} and reflect deeper combinatorial symmetries through the additional deformation parameter $t$. A central feature of this paper is the derivation of a combinatorial moment formula of the $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator and the $(q,t)$-Poisson distribution. This is accomplished by means of a card arrangement technique, which encodes set partitions together with crossing and nesting statistics. The resulting expression naturally exhibits a duality between these statistics, arising from a structure rooted in generalized Fibonacci numbers. Our approach provides a concrete framework where methods in combinatorics and theory of orthogonal polynomials are used to investigate the probabilistic properties arising from the $(q,t)$-deformation.</description>

      <title>On localization for the alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model with long-range hopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Anderson localization near the spectral edge for some alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with exponential long-range hopping. This extends the work of Bourgain [Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, LNM 1850: 77--99, 2004], in which he pioneered a novel multi-scale analysis to treat Bernoulli random variables. Our proof is mainly based on Bourgain's method. However, to establish the initial scales Green's function estimates, we adapt the approach of Klopp [Comm. Math. Phys, Vol. 232, 125--155, 2002], which is based on the Floquet-Bloch theory and a certain quantitative uncertainty principle. Our proof also applies to an analogues model on $\mathbb{R}^d.$</description>

      <title>Configured spaces and their M\"obius polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An arbitrary dependence structure between a finite family of events of a probability space defines a hypergraph structure. We study the converse operation, starting from a hypergraph structure, to determine a canonical probability space with events indexed by the vertices and that satisfy the prescribed dependence structure; we also require that events that are not mutually independent must be mutually exclusive. Such a hypergraph structure, we call a configuration.
  Requiring furthermore that all events are given the same positive probability $t$, converts this problem to the study of a family of M\"obius polynomials, which we call the relative M\"obius polynomials (or independence polynomial) of the configuration. This study was very much already complete in the case where the configuration actually derives from a graph structure, but remained open in the general case.
  We show the existence and uniqueness of an optimal real $t$, optimal in the sense that the events cover a subset of maximal probability. We base our study on a new formula for the derivative of the M\"obius polynomial.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rare event sampling for moving targets: extremes of temperature and daily precipitation in a general circulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events epitomize high cost: to society through their physical impacts, and to computer servers that are used to simulate them to provide information to mitigate those impacts. It costs hundreds of years to sample a few once-per-century events with straightforward model integration, but that cost can be much reduced with rare event sampling, which nudges ensembles of simulations to convert moderate events to severe ones, e.g., by steering a cyclone directly through a region of interest. With proper statistical accounting, rare event algorithms can provide quantitative climate risk assessment at reduced cost. But this can only work if ensemble members diverge fast enough. Sudden, transient events characteristic of Earth's midlatitude storm track regions, such as heavy precipitation and heat extremes, pose a particular challenge because they come and go faster than an ensemble can explore the possibilities. Here we extend standard rare event algorithms to handle this challenging case in an idealized atmospheric general circulation model, achieving 5-10 times sped-up estimation of long return periods, such as 100-150 years from only 20 years of simulation for extremes of daily precipitation and surface temperature. The algorithm, called TEAMS (``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting''), was developed previously in Finkel and O'Gorman (2024) using a toy chaotic system, and relies on a key parameter -- the advance split time -- which may be estimated based on simple diagnostics of ensemble dispersion rates. The results are promising for accelerated risk assessment across a wide range of physical hazards using more realistic and complex models with acute computational constraints.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation: Global solution and invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by both additive and multiplicative noises is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, spin current, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a unique pathwise solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove the convergence of this pathwise solution to that of the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation in the limit of vanishing exchange relaxation parameter. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, and prove the existence of nontrivial invariant measures. For temperatures above the Curie temperature, exponential stability of the solution and uniqueness of invariant measure are obtained under certain dissipativity conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exclusion process with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the headway exclusion process which is an exclusion process with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with jump rates that depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump but not on $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ unidirectionally it is proved by reverse duality that a certain family of non-stationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and a stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the max-type recursive model introduced by Hu and Shi (J. Stat. Phys., 2018), which generalizes the model of Derrida and Retaux (J. Stat. Phys., 2014). The class of geometric-type marginal distributions is preserved by the model with a geometric offspring distribution. We give some long-time asymptotic expansions of the parameters of the marginal distribution. From the expansions, we derive the asymptotics of the sustainability probability, marginal distribution, first moment and probability generating function.</description>

      <title>On the Weak Convergence of the Function-Indexed Sequential Empirical Process and its Smoothed Analogue under Nonstationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sequential empirical process indexed by general function classes and its smoothed set-indexed analogue. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</description>

      <title>Martingale and analytic dimensions coincide under Gaussian heat kernel bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet form on a metric measure space that satisfies Gaussian heat kernel bounds, we show that the martingale dimension of the associated diffusion process coincides with Cheeger's analytic dimension of the underlying metric measure space. More precisely, we show that the pointwise version of the martingale dimension introduced by Hino (called the pointwise index) almost everywhere equals the pointwise dimension of the measurable differentiable structure constructed by Cheeger. Using known properties of spaces that admit a measurable differentiable structure, we show that the martingale dimension is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying metric space, thereby extending an earlier bound obtained by Hino for some self-similar sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an elementary method to show non-Gaussianity of invariant measures of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations with polynomial non-linearities in the Da Prato--Debussche regime. The approach is essentially algebraic and involves using the generator equation of the SPDE at stationarity. Our results in particular cover the $\Phi^4_\delta$ measures in dimensions $\delta&lt;\frac{14}{5}$, which includes cases where the invariant measure is singular with respect to the invariant measure of the linear solution.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of consistent estimators in supercritical controlled branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a supercritical controlled branching process consistently from a single observed trajectory of population size counts. Our goal is to establish which parameters can and cannot be consistently estimated. When a parameter can be consistently estimated, we derive an explicit expression for the estimator. We address these questions in three scenarios: when the distribution of the control function distribution is known, when it is unknown, and when progenitor numbers are observed alongside population size counts. Our results offer a theoretical justification for the common practice in population ecology of estimating demographic and environmental stochasticity using separate observation schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with singular interactions, which include the Coulomb/Riesz/Biot-Savart kernels as typical examples (Examples 2.1 and 2.2), we derive the well-posedness and regularity estimates by establishing the entropy-cost inequality. To measure the singularity of interactions, we introduce a new probability distance induced by local integrable functions, and estimate this distance for the time-marginal laws of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions. A key point of the study is to characterize the path space of time-marginal distributions for the solutions, by using local hyperbound estimates on diffusion semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We study one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic cable equations driven by a multiplicative space-time white noise. Using the Malliavin-Stein method, we prove a central limit theorem for the spatial average of the solution. The convergence is established in the total variation distance with mild conditions. We also establish a functional central limit theorem with a technical assumption. Furthermore, we show that this assumption holds in a special case.</description>

      <title>Universal diameter bounds for random graphs with given degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$ which lie in the same connected component, and let $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$; so $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)=\infty$ if $G$ is not connected.
  Fix a sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of positive integers, and let $\mathbf{G}$ be a uniformly random connected simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$. We show that, unless a $1-o(1)$ proportion of vertices have degree $2$, then $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{diam}(\mathbf{G})]=O(\sqrt{n})$. It is not hard to see that this bound is best possible for general degree sequences (and in particular in the case of trees, in which $\sum_{v=1}^n d_v = 2(n-1)$). We also prove that this bound holds without the connectivity constraint. As a key input to the proofs, we show that graphs with minimum degree $3$ are with high probability connected and have logarithmic diameter: if $\min(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \ge 3$ then $\mathrm{diam}^+(\mathbf{G})=O_{\mathbb{P}}(\log n)$; this bound is also best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on a work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The upper bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

Inspired by and extending the matching algorithm via degree profiles by Ding, Ma, Wu and Xu (2021), we obtain an efficient matching algorithm as long as the minimal average degree is at least $\Omega(\log^{2} n)$ and the minimal correlation is at least $1 - O(\log^{-2} n)$.</description>

Abstract: Interference of randomly scattered classical waves naturally leads to familiar speckle patterns, where the wave intensity follows an exponential distribution while the wave field itself is described by a circularly symmetric complex normal distribution. In the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave beam propagation, we demonstrate how a deterministic incident beam transitions to such a fully developed speckle pattern over long distances in the so-called scintillation (weak-coupling) regime.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Lax approximation for value functions of L\'evy optimal control problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate stochastic versions of the Hopf-Lax formula which are based on compositions of the Hopf-Lax operator with the transition kernel of a L\'evy process taking values in a separable Banach space. We show that, depending on the order of the composition, one obtains upper and lower bounds for the value function of a stochastic optimal control problem associated to the drift controlled L\'evy dynamics. Dynamic consistency is restored by iterating the resulting operators. Moreover, the value function of the control problem is approximated both from above and below as the number of iterations tends to infinity, and we provide explicit convergence rates and guarantees for the approximation procedure.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Driven Instant Review: Confident Detection and Reconstruction of LLM Plagiarism on PC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.</description>
