      <title>Who Gets the Callback? Generative AI and Gender Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is being rapidly deployed in recruitment and for candidate shortlisting. We audit several mid-sized open-source LLMs for gender bias using a dataset of 332,044 real-world online job postings. For each posting, we prompt the model to recommend whether an equally qualified male or female candidate should receive an interview callback. We find that most models tend to favor men, especially for higher-wage roles. Mapping job descriptions to the Standard Occupational Classification system, we find lower callback rates for women in male-dominated occupations and higher rates in female-associated ones, indicating occupational segregation. A comprehensive analysis of linguistic features in job ads reveals strong alignment of model recommendations with traditional gender stereotypes. To examine the role of recruiter identity, we steer model behavior by infusing Big Five personality traits and simulating the perspectives of historical figures. We find that less agreeable personas reduce stereotyping, consistent with an agreeableness bias in LLMs. Our findings highlight how AI-driven hiring may perpetuate biases in the labor market and have implications for fairness and diversity within firms.</description>

      <title>Lights Out, Stress In: Assessing Stress Amidst Power and Energy Challenges in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the psychological impact of energy crises on households, utilising the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure the stress induced by disruptions in electricity, gas, and fuel supply and pricing. Through a multivariate analysis incorporating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Simultaneous-Quantile Regressions (SQR), Random Forest (RF) and Ordered Probit models, the research identifies the key socio-demographic and environmental factors influencing household stress. Our findings reveal that urban residency, low-income households, older individuals, and those with low environmental awareness are particularly vulnerable to stress during energy crises. Regional disparities and attitudes towards nuclear and renewable energy also significantly shape stress responses. The study emphasises the need for psychologically-informed energy policy, advocating for the inclusion of stress metrics in energy planning to enhance resilience and address the multi-dimensional nature of energy insecurity. This research contributes a novel, human-centric perspective to energy policy, urging policymakers to integrate psychosocial resilience alongside traditional technical and economic considerations in the design of energy interventions.</description>

      <title>Multigenerational Effects of Smallpox Vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the effects of childhood vaccination extend across three generations? Using Swedish data spanning 250 years, we estimate the impact of smallpox vaccination on longevity, disability, and occupational achievements. Employing mother fixed-effects, difference-in-differences, and shift-share instrumental-variables designs, we find that vaccination improves health and economic outcomes for at least two subsequent generations. Causal mediation analysis reveals that these benefits arise from improved health behaviors and epigenetic factors. Even in milder disease environments as seen today, vaccination delivers lasting advantages, demonstrating its long-term benefits beyond epidemic contexts. These findings highlight the benefits of early-life health interventions lasting for subsequent generations.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Higher-Order Elasticity Framework for Dynamic Diagnostics(2HOED)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning detects patterns, block chain guarantees trust and immutability, and modern causal inference identifies directional linkages, yet none alone exposes the full energetic anatomy of complex systems; the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics(2HOED) framework bridges these gaps. Grounded in classical mechanics but extended to Economics order elasticity terms, 2HOED represents economic, social, and physical systems as energy-based Hamiltonians whose position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of elasticity jointly determine systemic power, Inertia, policy sensitivity, and marginal responses. Because the formalism is scaling free and coordinate agnostic, it transfers seamlessly from financial markets to climate science, from supply chain logistics to epidemiology, thus any discipline in which adaptation and shocks coexist. By embedding standard econometric variables inside a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enriches conventional economic analysis with rigorous diagnostics of resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops, revealing failure modes invisible to linear models. Wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams derived from 2HOED expose multistage policy leverage that machine learning detects only empirically and block chain secures only after the fact. For economists, physicians and other scientists, the method opens a new causal energetic channel linking biological or mechanical elasticity to macro level outcomes. Portable, interpretable, and computationally light, 2HOED turns data streams into dynamical energy maps, empowering decision makers to anticipate crises, design adaptive policies, and engineer robust systems delivering the predictive punch of AI with the explanatory clarity of physics.</description>

      <title>Individuals, Crowds, and the Network Dynamics of Belief Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does talking to others make people more accurate or less accurate on numeric estimates such as quantitative evaluations or probabilistic forecasts? Research on peer-to-peer communication suggests that discussion between people will usually improve belief accuracy, while research on social networks suggests that error can percolate through groups and reduce accuracy. One challenge to interpreting empirical literature is that some studies measure accuracy at the group level, while others measure individual accuracy. We explain how social influence impacts belief accuracy by analyzing a formal model of opinion formation to identify the relationship between individual accuracy, group accuracy, and the network dynamics of belief formation. When opinions become more similar over time, change in individual error is always strictly better than change in group error, by a value equal to the change in variance. We show that change in group error can be decomposed into the influence network centralization, the accuracy/influence correlation ("calibration"), and the averageness/influence correlation ("herding"). Because group dynamics both theoretically and empirically lead people to become more similar over time, one might intuitively expect that the same factors which reduce group accuracy will also reduce individual accuracy. Instead, we find that individuals reliably improve under nearly all conditions, even when groups get worse. We support this analysis with data from six previously published experiments.</description>

      <title>The heterogeneous impact of the EU-Canada agreement with causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a causal machine learning approach to investigate the impact of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). We propose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain multidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels. We find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level intensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product churning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in eight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no longer exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects of the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on multiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by reallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing local market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional counterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the CETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other destinations are re-directed to Canada.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spillovers from Sampled Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical researchers often estimate spillover effects by fitting linear or non-linear regression models to sampled network data. Here, we show that common sampling schemes induce dependence between observed and unobserved spillovers. Due to this dependence, spillover estimates are biased, often upwards. We then show how researchers can construct unbiased estimates of spillover effects by rescaling using aggregate network statistics. Our results can be used to bound true effect sizes, determine robustness of estimates to missingness, and construct estimates when missingness depends on treatment. We apply our results to re-estimate the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks between US public firms, and peer effects amongst USAFA cadets.</description>

      <title>Securing the supply of graphite for batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for graphite in batteries has led to concerns around supply chain security. Currently, over 92% of global anode material is produced in China, posing a geopolitical risk for other countries reliant on graphite supply for domestic industries. This paper assesses the costs of producing battery-grade graphite (natural and synthetic) in the US and China using process-based cost models. We find that production costs in the US significantly exceed those in China due to higher capital intensity and input costs. Our analysis reveals that a majority of modeled projects in the US are not competitive at current market prices. We identify key cost drivers, including capital costs, economies of scale, and input material prices, and explore pathways to improve the competitiveness of US graphite production, such as supportive financing and process innovation directions. The analysis of conventional graphite production costs at scale also informs ceiling costs for alternative, promising pathways such as methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization. This study highlights the challenges and trade-offs in building a diversified graphite supply chain and informs policy and investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk mitigation in supply chains through network rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The networked nature of supply chains makes them susceptible to systemic risk, where local firm failures can propagate through firm interdependencies that can lead to cascading supply chain disruptions. The systemic risk of supply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and dynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties contribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can be significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry unnecessarily high levels of systemic risk. We discuss the possibility of devising policies to reduce systemic risk through minimal, targeted interventions in supply chain networks through market-based incentives.</description>
