      <title>Market Equilibria With Buying Rights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed buying rights into a (repeated) Arrow-Debreu model to study the long-term effects of regulation through buying rights on arising inequality. Our motivation stems from situations that typically call for regulatory interventions, such as rationing, namely, distribution crises in which demand and supply are persistently misaligned. In such settings, scarce resources tend to become increasingly concentrated among more affluent individuals, while the needs of the broader population remain unmet. While fully centralized distribution may be logistically or politically unfeasible, issuing buying rights offers a more practical alternative: they can be implemented digitally, e.g., via tokens traded on online platforms, making them significantly easier to administer. We model a scenario in which a regulator periodically distributes buying rights with the aim of promoting a more equitable allocation. Our contributions include (i) the definition of the (iterated) market where in each round the buying rights are distributed and then traded alongside the resource, (ii) the approximation algorithm of the market-clearing prices in every round, and (iii) the upper bound on \textit{frustration} -- a notion conceptually similar to the Price of Anarchy, but for systems regulated through buying rights, defined as the arising loss in fairness the individual buyers have to take when the distribution is handled via the market.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Predation: Equilibrium Analysis in Dynamic Oligopolies with Smooth Market Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predatory pricing -- where a firm strategically lowers prices to undermine competitors -- is a contentious topic in dynamic oligopoly theory, with scholars debating practical relevance and the existence of predatory equilibria. Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to capture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence and form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit (drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We focus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces the subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium can be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not in models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key findings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms reliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information oligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the resulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results demonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium strategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium analysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study answers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition authorities and regulators.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Preference Elicitation in Local Energy Markets: Combinatorial Clock Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) proliferate, future power system will need new market platforms enabling prosumers to trade various electricity and grid-support products. However, prosumers often exhibit complex, product interdependent preferences and face limited cognitive and computational resources, hindering engagement with complex market structures and bid formats. We address this challenge by introducing a multi-product market that allows prosumers to express complex preferences through an intuitive format, by fusing combinatorial clock exchange and machine learning (ML) techniques. The iterative mechanism only requires prosumers to report their preferred package of products at posted prices, eliminating the need for forecasting product prices or adhering to complex bid formats, while the ML-aided price discovery speeds up convergence. The linear pricing rule further enhances transparency and interpretability. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate convergence to clearing prices in approximately 15 clock iterations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Expectation Property for Max-Polymatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address an open problem on the computability of correlated equilibria in a variant of polymatrix where each player's utility is the maximum of their edge payoffs. We demonstrate that this max-variant game has the polynomial expectation property, and the results of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden can thus be applied. We propose ideas for extending these findings to other variants of polymatrix games, as well as briefly address the broader question of necessity for the polynomial expectation property when computing correlated equilibria.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, legislation, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Markovian Search with Ex-Ante Constraints: Theory and Applications to Socially Aware Algorithmic Hiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithmic framework to incorporate "ex-ante" constraints on outcomes (that hold only on average) into stateful sequential search with costly inspection. Our framework encompasses the classical Weitzman's Pandora's box [Weitzman, 1979] as well as its extensions to joint Markovian scheduling [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979], modeling richer processes such as multistage search with multiple layers of inspection. Ex-ante constraints in search are particularly motivated by social considerations in algorithmic hiring, where they adjust outcome distributions to promote equity and access. Building on the optimality of index-based policies in the unconstrained problems, we show that optimal policies under a single ex-ante constraint (e.g., demographic parity) retain an index-based structure but require (i) dual-based adjustments of the indices and (ii) randomization between two such adjustments via a "tie-breaking rule," both easy to compute and economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple affine constraints by reduction to a variant of the exact Carath\'eodory problem and providing a polynomial-time algorithm to construct an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. For general affine and convex constraints, we develop a primal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based adjustments, yielding a near-feasible, near-optimal policy. All these results rely on the key observation that a suitable relaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits index-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Finally, through a numerical study, we investigate the implications of various socially aware ex-ante constraints on the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and examine whether they achieve their intended socially desirable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Additively-Separable Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19325v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sub-class of bi-matrix games which we refer to as two-person (hereafter referred to as two-player) additively-separable sum (TPASS) games, where the sum of the pay-offs of the two players is additively separable. The row player's pay-off at each pair of pure strategies, is the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the column player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the column player. The column player's pay-off at each pair of pure strategies, is also the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the row player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the row player. The sum of the inter-dependent components of the pay-offs of the two players is assumed to be zero. We prove the existence of equilibrium for such games and show that the set of equilibria for such games is the projection on the set of strategy pairs of the solutions of a pair of linear programming problems that are dual to each other. This result is a generalization of the corresponding and well-known result for two-person zero-sum games. We also show that a (randomized or mixed) strategy pair is an equilibrium of the game if and only if there exist two other real numbers such that the three together solve a certain linear programming problem. In order to prove this result, we need to appeal to the existence of an equilibrium for the TPASS game. The technology we use to prove our results, consists of the duality theorems and the complementary slackness theorem of linear programming.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When online sellers use AI learning algorithms to automatically compete on e-commerce platforms, there is concern that they will learn to coordinate on higher than competitive prices. However, this concern was primarily raised in single-dimension price competition. We investigate whether this prediction holds when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. We analyze competition in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a large-scale dataset from Amazon.com to provide empirical evidence. We show that when consumers have high search costs, learning algorithms can coordinate on prices lower than competitive prices, facilitating a win-win-win for consumers, sellers, and platforms. This occurs because algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices and enlarging demand on the platform. We also show that our results generalize to any learning algorithm that uses exploration of price and advertising bids. Consistent with our predictions, an empirical analysis shows that price levels exhibit a negative interaction between estimated consumer search costs and algorithm usage index. We analyze the platform's strategic response and find that reserve price adjustments will not increase platform profits, but commission adjustments will, while maintaining the beneficial outcomes for both sellers and consumers.</description>
