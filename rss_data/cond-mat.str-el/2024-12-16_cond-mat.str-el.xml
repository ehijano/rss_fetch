      <title>Unlocking new regimes in fractional quantum Hall effect with quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that formulating the composite-fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect in terms of quaternions greatly expands its reach and opens the door into many interesting issues that were previously beyond the reach of quantitative theoretical investigation. As an illustration, we investigate the possibility of a nematic or a charge-density wave instability of the composite-fermion Fermi sea at half-filled Landau level and of the nearby FQH states by looking for a magneto-roton instability. Our quaternion formulation of the FQH effect has been inspired by mathematical developments in the theoretical analyses of gravitational wave modes and cosmic microwave background radiation, where an important role is played by spin-weighted spherical harmonics which are nothing but monopole harmonics appearing in the spherical geometry for the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Bilayer orthogonal ferromagnetism in CrTe$_2$-based van der Waals system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with pronounced spin anisotropy play a pivotal role in advancing magnetization switching and spin-wave generation mechanisms, which are fundamental for spintronic technologies. Quasi-van der Waals ferromagnets, particularly Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compounds, represent seminal materials in this field, renowned for their delicate balance between frustrated layered geometries and magnetism. Despite extensive investigation, the precise nature of their magnetic ground state, typically described as a canted ferromagnet, remains contested, as does the mechanism governing spin reorientation under external magnetic fields and varying temperatures. In this work, we leverage a multimodal approach, integrating complementary techniques, to reveal that Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ ($\delta = 0.25 - 0.50$) hosts a previously overlooked magnetic phase, which we term orthogonal-ferromagnetism. This single phase consists of alternating atomically sharp single layers of in-plane and out-of-plane ferromagnetic blocks, coupled via exchange interactions and as such, it differs significantly from crossed magnetism, which can be achieved exclusively by stacking multiple heterostructural elements together. Contrary to earlier reports suggesting a gradual spin reorientation in CrTe$_2$-based systems, we present definitive evidence of abrupt spin-flop-like transitions. This discovery, likely due to the improved crystallinity and lower defect density in our samples, repositions Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compounds as promising candidates for spintronic and orbitronic applications, opening new pathways for device engineering.</description>

      <title>Switchable Chern insulator, isospin competitions and charge density waves in rhombohedral graphene moire superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based moire superlattices provide a versatile platform for exploring novel correlated and topological electronic states, driven by enhanced Coulomb interactions within flat bands. The intrinsic tunability of graphene s multiple degrees of freedom enables precise control over these complex quantum phases. In this study, we observe a range of competing phases and their transitions in rhombohedrally stacked hexalayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (r-6G/hBN) moire superlattices. When electrons are polarized away from the moire superlattice, we firstly identify a Chern insulator with reversible Chern numbers at v = 1 (one electron per moire cell), attributed to the competition between bulk and edge magnetizations.Then, we detect transitions between three distinct insulating states at v = 2, driven by vertical displacement field D and vertical magnetic field B. These insulating phases are distinguished as spin-antiferromagnetic, spin-polarized, and valley-polarized insulators, based on their responses to parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields. When electrons are polarized toward the moire superlattice, in a device with large twist angle, insulating states appear at v = 1/3 and 2/3 at zero magnetic field, and v = 1/2 in a magnetic field. Our findings reveal a rich interplay of charge, isospin, topology and magnetic field in rhombohedral graphene moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>Spin density wave and van Hove singularity in the kagome metal CeTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals with van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena, including chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, unconventional magnetic states driven by VHSs, such as spin-density waves (SDWs), have yet to be observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where the Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Our neutron diffraction measurements reveal an incommensurate SDW ground state of the Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments, which notably coexists with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by both thermal fluctuations and external magnetic fields, resulting in a rich phase diagram that includes an intermediate single-Q SDW phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements identify VHSs near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a VHS-assisted SDW in CeTi3Bi4. These findings establish the rare-earth Kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Large Kohn anomaly and phonon collapse induced by charge density wave in UPt$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm CDW}$, and becomes over-damped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with a potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, further corroborating a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as an exemplary case of an electronically driven strongly correlated CDW system.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity for the planar limit of holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity is a fundamental characteristic of states within a quantum system. Its use is however mostly limited to bosonic systems, inhibiting its present applicability to supersymmetric theories. This is also relevant to its application to the AdS/CFT correspondence. To address this limitation, we extend the framework of spread complexity beyond bosonic systems to include fermionic and supercoherent states. This offers a gateway to compute spread complexity analytically for any semiclassical system governed by a Hamiltonian associated with a Lie (super)algebra. This requires extending the Krylov chain to a Krylov path in a higher-dimensional lattice. A detailed analysis of supercoherent states within the super Heisenberg-Weyl and OSp$(2|1)$ algebras elucidates distinct contributions from bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom to the complexity. This generalisation allows us to access the semiclassical regime of the planar limit of the holographic correspondence. We then compute the spread complexity of large charge superstring states on the gravity side, which are equivalent to the dual gauge states. The resulting complexity leads to Krylov paths capturing the geometry in which the string propagates.</description>

      <title>Towards the phase diagram of fermions coupled with $SO(3)$ quantum links in $(2+1)$-D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum link models (QLMs) are generalizations of Wilson's lattice gauge theory formulated with finite-dimensional link Hilbert spaces. In certain cases, the non-Abelian Gauss Law constraint can be exactly solved, and the gauge invariant subspace embedded onto local spin Hamiltonians for efficient quantum simulation. In $(1+1)d$ previous studies of the $SO(3)$ QLM coupled to adjoint fermionic matter have been shown to reflect key properties of QCD and nuclear physics, including distinct confining/deconfining phases and hadronic bound states. We extend the model to $(2+1)d$ dimensions for the first time, and report on our initial results. We review the construction of gauge-invariant state space for the proposed models, and study the single-plaquette ground state via exact-diagonalisation. We provide indications of a rich phase diagram which shows both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and distinct magnetic phases characterised by different plaquette expectation values.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of One-Site Entanglement and Reduced Fidelity in an Anisotropic Spin-2 chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the matrix product formalism, we have studied the variation of entanglement and fidelity measures in the MP ground states of a generic anisotropic spin 2 chain with nearest neighbour interactions and shared symmetries. These MP states represent the exact Ground State solutions of the system and display distinctive characteristics determined by a maximum of three parameters exhibiting one antiferromagnetic Haldane phase (AFMH), together with a secondary weak antiferromagnetic (WAFM) and a weak ferromagnetic phase (WFM). Using Transfer Matrix Method (TM), we have obtained nontrivial features in the variation of Quantum Correlation measures and QIT Measures around the VBS point for an acritical choice of the parameters, and a Quantum Critical Point, for a critical choice of the parameters, of the AFMH spin liquid phase of the system.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced skyrmion deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we perform a systematic analysis of equilibrium solutions for Neel and Bloch skyrmions on a cylindrical shell and demonstrate that both experience curvature-induced deformation. Considering the curvature as a small perturbation and applying the first-order perturbation theory we decompose the deformation on the radial symmetrical and elliptical parts. The orientation of the elliptically deformed skyrmion shape depends on the skyrmion type. For Neel skyrmion, the long semi-axis of the ellipse is oriented along or perpendicularly to the cylinder generatrix depending on the signs of the curvature and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. In contrast, the elliptical shape of the Bloch skyrmion makes an angle $\pm\pi/4$ with the generatrix. The theoretically predicted skyrmion shapes are compared to those obtained from the numerical spin-lattice simulations. Using simulations we also investigate the nonlinear regime beyond the applicability of the first-order perturbation theory. In particular, we demonstrate that Neel skyrmion can collapse for a large enough curvature.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and magic spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and magic, offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings.Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and saturation of magic at time scales that increase logarithmically with system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of energy conservation in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractonic many-body systems are characterized by mobility restrictions on single-particle hopping due to the conservation of higher moments (e.g., dipoles, angular momenta, and quadrupoles). This conservation allows the definition of new symmetries and their physical consequences, with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) being especially intriguing in bosonic systems. Building on previous work [Yuan \textit{et al. arXiv:1911.02876] and [Chen \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2010.03261], we propose a new class of phases called hybrid fractonic superfluids (HFS), where multiple boson species interact and moment hybridization is conserved. We focus on two model series: Model Series A, where moments of the same order from different species are conserved, and Model Series B, where moments of different orders are conserved. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the analysis to higher-order moments. We investigate ground states, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and the spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry, showing that at zero temperature, charge symmetry is partially broken when the spatial dimension is at least $N+1$. This results in off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) driven by particle-hole bound states formed by bosons of different species. In Model Series B, we explore systems conserving mixed dipole-quadrupole moments. Additionally, we construct Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models where the small Hubbard $U$ limit realizes HFS for both series. We analyze mean-field phase diagrams for Model Series A and discuss potential realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, e.g., MW theorems and large-scale numerical studies for Bose-Hubbard models. This article, together with previous work, forms a trilogy of fractonic superfluids to uncover the exotic interplay of SSB physics and fracton physics.</description>

Abstract: Lattice simulations have observed a novel strong coupling symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase for the SU(3) gauge system with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions (represented by two sets of staggered fields) at very large renormalized coupling ($g^2_{GF} \gtrsim 25$). The results of Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 014513 suggest that the SMG phase is separated from the weak coupling, conformal phase by a continuous phase transition, implying that the SMG phase exists in the continuum limit. To scrutinize these findings, we are generating a set of large volume zero temperature ensembles using nHYP improved staggered fermions with additional Pauli-Villars fields to tame gauge field fluctuations. We consider the low-lying meson spectrum and verify the existence of the SMG phase. Based on a finite size scaling analysis we predict that the phase transition between the strong and weak coupling phases is likely governed by a merged fixed point that is ultraviolet in the strong coupling but infrared in the weak coupling side. This finding suggests that the SU(3) 8-flavor system sits at the opening of the conformal window</description>

      <title>Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models: SU($N$) magnetic $\eta$ pairing, weak ergodicity breaking, and partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry on the lattice: Geometry, Topology, and Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, supersymmetry (SUSY) posits an equivalence between two elementary degrees of freedom, bosons, and fermions defined by local rules. Here we apply it to find connections between bosonic and fermionic lattice models in the realm of condensed matter physics and uncover a novel 5-fold way topology it demands in these systems. At the single-particle level, our connections pair a bosonic and fermionic lattice model, either describing the hopping of number-conserving particles or local couplings between fermion parity-conserving particles. The pair are isospectral except for zero modes, such as flat bands, quadratic band touchings, and nexus points, whose existence is undergirded by the Witten index of the SUSY theory. We develop a unifying framework to formulate these SUSY connections in terms of general lattice graph correspondences. Notably, in this framework, the supercharge operator that generates SUSY is Hermitian and can itself be interpreted as a hopping Hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice, a feature that enables the discovery of materials or model lattices hosting the SUSY partners. To illustrate the power of SUSY, we present 16 use cases of SUSY, that span topics including frustrated magnets, Kitaev spin liquids, and topological superconductors, the majority of which turn out to provide insights into the discovery and design of flat bands and topological materials.</description>

      <title>Curvature induced magnetization of altermagnetic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a thin film of $d$-wave altermagnet bent in a stretching-free manner and demonstrate that gradients of the film curvature induce a local magnetization which is approximately tangential to the film. The magnetization amplitude directly reflects the altermagnetic symmetry and depends on the direction of bending. It is maximal for the bending along directions of the maximal altermagnetic splitting of the magnon bands. A periodically bent film of sinusoidal shape possesses a total magnetic moment per period $\propto\mathscr{A}^2q^4$ where $\mathscr{A}$ and $q$ are the bending amplitude and wave vector, respectively. The total magnetic moment is perpendicular to the plane of the unbent film and its direction (up or down) is determined by the bending direction. A film roll up to a nanotube possesses a toroidal moment directed along the tube $\propto \delta_r/r^2$ per one coil, where $r$ and $\delta_r$ are the coil radius and the pitch between coils. All these analytical predictions agree with numerical spin-lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice: from supersolid to gapped solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by numerically studying excitations and the dynamical spin structure factor $S^{\mu\mu}({\bf q},\omega)$. Results are analyzed within the supersolid scenario, characterized by the translation-symmetry-breaking parameter $m_z$ and the supersolid offdiagonal order parameter $m_\perp$. We find very robust $m_z &gt; 0$ in the whole easy-axis anisotropy regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z &gt; 0$, even enhanced by the magnetic field $h&gt;0$, as well as $m_\perp &gt;0$ for intermediate $\alpha &lt;1$ and $h&gt;0$. Still, at small $\alpha \lesssim 0.2$, relevant for recent experiments on the magnetic material K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, we find at $h=0$ rather vanishing $m_\perp \sim 0$, consistent with the numerical evidence of the finite magnon excitation gap $\Delta_1 \sim 0.25 \alpha J$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the linked cluster expansion as well as the quench action approach to study the time evolution of one-point functions after a quantum quench in integrable field theories. We argue that the relaxation towards the stationary value fundamentally differs depending on the locality properties of the considered observable: while for local operators both exponential and power-law decaying terms are present in the dynamics, for semi-local operators the latter are absent. We explicitly confirm this for the Ising field theory, the sinh-Gordon model, and the repulsive sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Minimal pole representation and analytic continuation of matrix-valued correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal pole method for analytically continuing matrix-valued imaginary frequency correlation functions to the real axis, enabling precise access to off-diagonal elements and thus improving the interpretation of self-energies and susceptibilities in quantum simulations. Traditional methods for matrix-valued analytic continuation tend to be either noise-sensitive or make ad-hoc positivity assumptions. Our approach avoides these issues via the construction of a compact pole representation with shared poles through exponential fits, expanding upon prior work focused on scalar functions. We test our method across various scenarios, including fermionic and bosonic response functions, with and without noise, and for both continuous and discrete spectra of real materials and model systems. Our findings demonstrate that this technique addresses the shortcomings of existing methodologies, such as artificial broadening and positivity violations. The paper is supplemented with a sample implementation in Python.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the ``pair-breaking scattering interference" as a general source of coherence peak modulations in superconductors. Assuming this mechanism, we present a simple physical picture for the coherence peak modulations in overdoped cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223), ferromagnetic iron pnictide EuRbFe$_4$As$_4$ (Eu-1144), and kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, and Cs). Specifically, we explain the wavevectors, the particle-hole symmetry, and the dependence on the internal or external Zeeman-field of the coherence peak modulations. This work is intended as a cautious reminder to the scientific community when asserting the existence of a pair density wave phenomenon in the absence of tunneling conductance modulations in the normal state.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforced entanglement in maximally mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is typically fragile to interactions with the environment. Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is `strongly symmetric', i.e. it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS), and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable, and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g. $SU(2)$), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically $\sim \log N$ with the number of qudits $N$.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>
