      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Feature-Guided Sampling Strategy for Adaptive Model Order Reduction of Convection-Dominated Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though high-performance computing enables high-fidelity simulations of complex engineering systems, accurately resolving multi-scale physics for real-world problems remains computationally prohibitive, particularly in many-query applications such as optimization and uncertainty quantification. Projection-based model order reduction (MOR) has demonstrated significant potential for reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude through the creation of reduced-order models (ROMs). However, physical problems featuring strong convection, such as hypersonic flows and detonations, pose significant challenges to conventional MOR techniques due to the slow decay of Kolmogorov N-width present in these problems. In the past few years various approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; one of the promising methods is the adaptive MOR. In this work, we introduce a feature-guided adaptive projection-based MOR framework tailored for convection-dominated problems involving flames and shocks. This approach dynamically updates the ROM subspace and incorporates a feature-guided sampling method that strategically selects sampling points to capture prominent convective features, ensuring accurate predictions of crucial dynamics in the target problems. We evaluate the proposed methodology using a suite of challenging convection-dominated test problems, including shocks, flames, and detonations. The results demonstrate the feature-guided adaptive ROM's capability in producing efficient and reliable predictions of the nonlinear convection-dominated physical phenomena in the selected test suite, which are well recognized to be challenging for conventional ROM methods.</description>

      <title>Velocity modulations in view of the elliptical approach at Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of the poloidal velocity of the turbulence and the poloidal mean flow velocity are important quantities for the study of sheared flows on turbulence and transport. The estimation depends on the underlying model of the turbulence. Beside the propagation time of the turbulence, its decay with the fading time must be considered. For the description of the propagation, the elliptical approach is applied, which takes into account the propagation and fading time of the turbulence. The model has been applied successfully in experimental fluid dynamics and is confirmed by direct numerical simulations, also.
  In this paper, the elliptical approach is applied in the analysis of density fluctuations, measured by poloidal correlation reflectometry at two different fusion devices, TEXTOR and W7-X. For the latter, it is demonstrated that the elliptical approach is necessary for a correct description of the turbulence propagation. In addition, the velocity modulations are investigated, which in principle can be either generated by an oscillation of the propagation time of density fluctuations and/or an oscillation of the fading of the turbulence. An example for low frequency velocity oscillations in W7-X will be given in the paper, showing a relation between turbulence properties and small oscillations on the measured diamagnetic plasma energy.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.</description>

      <title>The role of symmetries in the axisymmetric jet mean velocity profile development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that physical conservation laws can be derived from symmetry properties of space and time, as shown by Emily N\"other, has been utilized in predicting the development of the round turbulent jet from the jet exit to the far field. In particular, the developing region has been described using an analytical approach in combination with using a numerical recursive program. Both approaches assume that the only forces acting on the flow are internal shear forces in a Newtonian constant density fluid. The analytical and numerical predictions both display excellent agreement with carefully conducted measurements. The jet spreading angle is observed to be directly coupled to the turbulent momentum diffusion, hence the spreading rate depends on the upstream, or initial, conditions. The jet entrainment and momentum rate are both observed to be constant, even across the developing jet. Since the solution of the jet development depends on the initial conditions, the total (molecular and turbulent) viscosity and the initial velocity profile must be input into the analytical or numerical solver to obtain the correct solution. The Reynolds number is observed to not enter into the analytical or numerical solution and experiments confirm that the jet spreading is independent of the Reynolds number in the tested range, $Re = 3\,200 - 32\,000$. We emphasize that our results do not rely on any assumptions of self-similarity or prior knowledge about the jet from experiments, only the Galilei symmetry properties, and that the results are valid throughout the jet.</description>

      <title>Taylor dispersion in variable-density, variable-viscosity pulsatile flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Taylor or shear-induced dispersion of a non-passive scalar field in a pulsatile pipe flow is investigated, accounting for the scalar field's influence on fluid density and transport coefficients. By employing multiple scale analysis, an effective one-dimensional, unsteady mixing problem for the scalar field is obtained, which includes the diffusion coefficient for shear-induced dispersion. The resulting governing equations are applicable to a range of scalar transport problems in pulsatile pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of appendages on the turbulence and flow noise of a submarine model using high-order scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs high-fidelity numerical simulations to investigate the influence of appendages on the turbulent flow dynamics and far-field acoustic radiation of the SUBOFF submarine model at a Reynolds number of Re = 1.2*10^7. Utilizing a third-order numerical scheme combined with wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy, the hydrodynamic and acoustic behaviors of an appended SUBOFF configuration are compared to those of a bare hull. A computational grid of 103 million cells resolves the intricate flow interactions, while 648 hydrophones positioned 500 diameters from the model capture far-field acoustic signatures. Key results reveal that appendages significantly amplify hydrodynamic and acoustic disturbances. Flow separations and vortex shedding at appendage junctions elevate pressure-induced drag contributions, contrasting the viscous-dominated drag of the bare hull. The sail-hull interaction intensifies local surface pressure fluctuations, increasing power spectral density (PSD) amplitudes by up to an order of magnitude. In the far field, the appended SUBOFF generates sound pressure levels approximately 20 dB higher than the bare hull, with distinct dipole directivity patterns and peak noise levels (85.10 dB) observed on the central plane. Appendages also disrupt wake symmetry, introducing complex vortical structures such as horseshoe and necklace vortices. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of appendages on hydrodynamic and acoustic behavior, filling a gap in turbulence noise research for complex underwater geometries and providing a vital foundation for the noise reduction optimization of advanced underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional variational data assimilation of separated flows using time-averaged experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for assimilating planar PIV experimental data using a variational approach to enhance the predictions of the Spalart-Allmaras RANS turbulence model. Our method applies three-dimensional constraints to the assimilation of mean velocity data, incorporating a corrective forcing term in the momentum equations. The advantages of this approach are highlighted through a direct comparison with traditional two-dimensional assimilation using the same experimental dataset. We demonstrate its efficacy by assimilating the deep stall flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at a $15^\circ$ angle of attack and a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re_c \approx 7.5 \times 10^4$. We find that in two-dimensional assimilation, the corrective forcing term compensates not only for physical modeling errors but also for the lack of divergence in the experimental data. This conflation makes it difficult to isolate the effects of measurement inconsistencies from deficiencies in the turbulence model. In contrast, three-dimensional assimilation allows the corrective forcing term to primarily address experimental setup errors while enabling the turbulence model to more accurately capture the flow physics. We establish the superiority of three-dimensional assimilation by demonstrating improved agreement in reconstructed quantities, including pressure, lift force, and Reynolds shear stress.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient rapid prediction of urban airflow and temperature fields for complex building geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting urban microclimate, including wind speed and temperature, based solely on building geometry requires capturing complex interactions between buildings and airflow, particularly long-range wake effects influenced by directional geometry. Traditional methods relying on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are prohibitively expensive for large-scale simulations, while data-driven approaches struggle with limited training data and the need to model both local and far-field dependencies. In response, we propose a novel framework that leverages a multi-directional distance feature (MDDF) combined with localized training to achieve effective wind field predictions with minimal CFD data. By reducing the problem's dimensionality, localized training effectively increases the number of training samples, while MDDF encodes the surrounding geometric information to accurately model wake dynamics and flow redirection. Trained on only 24 CFD simulations, our localized Fourier neural operator (Local-FNO) model generates full 3D wind velocity and temperature predictions in under one minute, yielding a 500-fold speedup over conventional CFD methods. With mean absolute errors of 0.3 m/s for wind speed and 0.3 $^{\circ}$C for temperature on unseen urban configurations, our method demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and significant potential for practical urban applications.</description>

      <title>Role of enthalpy transport in laminar premixed hydrogen flames at atmospheric and elevated pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses the role of diffusive enthalpy transport in relation to the origin of thermodiffusive instability and the resulting enhanced reactivity. Thermodiffusive effects in premixed hydrogen flames are typically explained and modelled via local equivalence ratio fluctuations. However, it is reiterated here that the imbalance between species and thermal diffusion (differential diffusion), rather than local species-to-species diffusive imbalances (preferential diffusion) is the leading-order effect. Reactant (H$_2$), product (H$_2$O) and intermediate (H) species are demonstrated to all play a role in the transport of enthalpy through an analysis of enthalpy flux divergence terms in unstretched flames. Premixed counterflow flames at various strain rates and pressures are then analysed to demonstrate that enhanced reactivity originates from a combination of enthalpy transport and the broadness of the reaction zone relative to the thickness of the flame. Effects resulting from key pressure fall-off reactions are also discussed to determine the importance of detailed chemistry, and the usage of Zeldovich number. Finally, two-dimensional planar flames are simulated and analysed to demonstrate the role of curvature in addition to strain rate, and the implications of the findings in blends and turbulent flames are discussed.</description>

      <title>Deep learning in the abyss: a stratified Physics Informed Neural Network for data assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of deep ocean currents is a major challenge in data assimilation due to the scarcity of interior data. In this work, we present a proof of concept for deep ocean flow reconstruction using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), a machine learning approach that offers an alternative to traditional data assimilation methods. We introduce an efficient algorithm called StrAssPINN (for Stratified Assimilation PINNs), which assigns a separate network to each layer of the ocean model while allowing them to interact during training. The neural network takes spatiotemporal coordinates as input and predicts the velocity field at those points. Using a SIREN architecture (a multilayer perceptron with sine activation functions), which has proven effective in various contexts, the network is trained using both available observational data and dynamical priors enforced at several collocation points. We apply this method to pseudo-observed ocean data generated from a 3-layer quasi-geostrophic model, where the pseudo-observations include surface-level data akin to SWOT observations of sea surface height, interior data similar to ARGO floats, and a limited number of deep ARGO-like measurements in the lower layers. Our approach successfully reconstructs ocean flows in both the interior and surface layers, demonstrating a strong ability to resolve key ocean mesoscale features, including vortex rings, eastward jets associated with potential vorticity fronts, and smoother Rossby waves. This work serves as a prelude to applying StrAssPINN to real-world observational data.</description>

      <title>Characteristic boundary conditions for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of characteristic boundary conditions (CBCs) within the framework of Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, including both the Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBCs) and a novel approach to generalized characteristic relaxation boundary conditions (GRCBCs). CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.</description>

      <title>Understanding Latent Timescales in Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Models for Advection-Dominated Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for developing accelerated surrogate models of complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). A popular approach for PDE systems employs a two-step strategy: a nonlinear dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder, followed by time integration in the latent space using a neural ODE. This study examines the applicability of such autoencoder-based neural ODE architectures to systems where advection dominates the dynamics. In addition to predictive performance, this work investigates the mechanisms behind model acceleration by analyzing how the autoencoder and neural ODE components influence latent system time-scales. These effects are quantified through eigenvalue analysis of dynamical system Jacobians. Specifically, the study evaluates the sensitivity of model accuracy and discovered latent time-scales to key training choices: decoupled versus end-to-end training, latent space dimensionality, and training trajectory length. A central finding is the crucial role of training trajectory length (i.e., the number of rollout steps included in the loss function), which directly impacts the recovered latent time-scales. Longer trajectories lead to larger limiting time-scales in the latent system, and the most accurate models are shown to capture the largest time-scales of the original system. These insights are demonstrated across a diverse set of unsteady, advection-driven fluid dynamics problems: (1) the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, (2) hydrogen-air channel detonations governed by the compressible reacting Navier-Stokes equations, and (3) 2D atmospheric flows.</description>

      <title>Enhancing machine learning turbulence model generalizability via tensor basis normalization</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, the development and study of machine learning turbulence models have become increasingly prevalent. As a critical component of turbulence modeling, the constitutive relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean flow quantities, modeled using machine learning methods, faces a pressing challenge: the lack of generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a novel tensor basis normalization technique to improve machine learning turbulence models, grounded in the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. In this study, we utilize direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of periodic hill flows as training data to develop a symbolic regression-based turbulence model based on the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. Furthermore, we construct a systematic validation dataset to evaluate the generalizability of our symbolic regression-based turbulence model. This validation set includes periodic hills with different aspect ratios from the training dataset, zero pressure gradient flat plate flows, three-dimensional incompressible flows over a NACA0012 airfoil, and transonic axial compressor rotor flows. These validation cases exhibit significant flow characteristics and geometrical variations, progressively increasing their differences from the training dataset. Such a diverse validation set is a robust benchmark to assess the generalizability of the proposed turbulence model. Finally, we demonstrate that our symbolic regression-based turbulence model performs effectively across validation cases, encompassing various separation features, geometries, and Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Smooth invariant foliations and Koopman eigenfunctions about stable equilibria of semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a $C^r$ semiflow $\{ \varphi_t \}_{t \geq 0}$ on a Banach space $X$ admitting a stable fixed point $x$. We show, along the lines of the parameterization method (Cabr\'e et al., 2003), the existence of a $C^r$ invariant foliation tangent to $X_1$ at $x$, for an arbitrary $D \varphi_t(x)$-invariant subspace $X_1 \subset X$ satisfying some additional spectral conditions. Uniqueness ensues in a subclass of sufficiently smooth invariant foliations tangent to $X_1$ at $x$. We then draw relations to Koopman theory, and thereby establish the existence and uniqueness, in some appropriate sense, of $C^r$ Koopman eigenfunctions. We demonstrate that these results apply to the case of the Navier-Stokes system, the archetypal example considered by the modern upheaval of applied 'Koopmanism'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <title>Onset of Intermittency and Multiscaling in Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>

      <title>Geometry Matters: Benchmarking Scientific ML Approaches for Flow Prediction around Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate simulations of fluid dynamics around complicated geometric bodies are critical in a variety of engineering and scientific applications, including aerodynamics and biomedical flows. However, while scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown considerable promise, most studies in this field are limited to simple geometries, and complex, real-world scenarios are underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by benchmarking diverse SciML models, including neural operators and vision transformer-based foundation models, for fluid flow prediction over intricate geometries. Using a high-fidelity dataset of steady-state flows across various geometries, we evaluate the impact of geometric representations -- Signed Distance Fields (SDF) and binary masks -- on model accuracy, scalability, and generalization. Central to this effort is the introduction of a novel, unified scoring framework that integrates metrics for global accuracy, boundary layer fidelity, and physical consistency to enable a robust, comparative evaluation of model performance. Our findings demonstrate that newer foundation models significantly outperform neural operators, particularly in data-limited scenarios, and that SDF representations yield superior results with sufficient training data. Despite these promises, all models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, highlighting a critical challenge for future SciML applications. By advancing both evaluation models and modeling capabilities, our work paves the way for robust and scalable ML solutions for fluid dynamics across complex geometries.</description>

      <title>From non-equilibrium Green's functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, which may lead to a significant reduction of friction a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum- nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the lengthscale of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena at scales of engineering relevance.</description>
