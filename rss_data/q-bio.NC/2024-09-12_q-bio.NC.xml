      <title>Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the human visual cortex encode sensory information? To address this question, we explore the covariance structure of neural representations. We perform a cross-decomposition analysis of fMRI responses to natural images in multiple individuals from the Natural Scenes Dataset and find that neural representations systematically exhibit a power-law covariance spectrum over four orders of magnitude in ranks. This scale-free structure is found in multiple regions along the visual hierarchy, pointing to the existence of a generic encoding strategy in visual cortex. We also show that, up to a rotation, a large ensemble of principal axes of these population codes are shared across subjects, showing the existence of a universal high-dimensional representation. This suggests a high level of convergence in how the human brain learns to represent natural scenes despite individual differences in neuroanatomy and experience. We further demonstrate that a spectral approach is critical for characterizing population codes in their full extent, and in doing so, we reveal a vast space of uncharted dimensions that have been out of reach for conventional variance-weighted methods. A global view of neural representations thus requires embracing their high-dimensional nature and understanding them statistically rather than through visual or semantic interpretation of individual dimensions.</description>

      <title>Detailed delineation of the fetal brain in diffusion MRI via multi-task learning</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI is increasingly used to study the normal and abnormal development of fetal brain in-utero. Recent studies have shown that dMRI can offer invaluable insights into the neurodevelopmental processes in the fetal stage. However, because of the low data quality and rapid brain development, reliable analysis of fetal dMRI data requires dedicated computational methods that are currently unavailable. The lack of automated methods for fast, accurate, and reproducible data analysis has seriously limited our ability to tap the potential of fetal brain dMRI for medical and scientific applications. In this work, we developed and validated a unified computational framework to (1) segment the brain tissue into white matter, cortical/subcortical gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, (2) segment 31 distinct white matter tracts, and (3) parcellate the brain's cortex and delineate the deep gray nuclei and white matter structures into 96 anatomically meaningful regions. We utilized a set of manual, semi-automatic, and automatic approaches to annotate 97 fetal brains. Using these labels, we developed and validated a multi-task deep learning method to perform the three computations. Our evaluations show that the new method can accurately carry out all three tasks, achieving a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.865 on tissue segmentation, 0.825 on white matter tract segmentation, and 0.819 on parcellation. The proposed method can greatly advance the field of fetal neuroimaging as it can lead to substantial improvements in fetal brain tractography, tract-specific analysis, and structural connectivity assessment.</description>

      <title>Policy consequences of the new neuroeconomic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current theories of decision making suggest that the neural circuits in mammalian brains (including humans) computationally combine representations of the past (memory), present (perception), and future (agentic goals) to take actions that achieve the needs of the agent. How information is represented within those neural circuits changes what computations are available to that system which changes how agents interact with their world to take those actions. We argue that the computational neuroscience of decision making provides a new microeconomic framework (neuroeconomics) that offers new opportunities to construct policies that interact with those decision-making systems to improve outcomes. After laying out the computational processes underlying decision making in mammalian brains, we present four applications of this logic with policy consequences: (1) contingency management as a treatment for addiction, (2) precommitment and the sensitivity to sunk costs, (3) media consequences for changes in housing prices after a disaster, and (4) how social interactions underlie the success (and failure) of microfinance institutions.</description>
