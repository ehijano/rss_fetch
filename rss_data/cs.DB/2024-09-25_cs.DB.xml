      <title>PACE: Poisoning Attacks on Learned Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CE) plays a crucial role in database optimizer. We have witnessed the emergence of numerous learned CE models recently which can outperform traditional methods such as histograms and samplings. However, learned models also bring many security risks. For example, a query-driven learned CE model learns a query-to-cardinality mapping based on the historical workload. Such a learned model could be attacked by poisoning queries, which are crafted by malicious attackers and woven into the historical workload, leading to performance degradation of CE. In this paper, we explore the potential security risks in learned CE and study a new problem of poisoning attacks on learned CE in a black-box setting. Experiments show that PACE reduces the accuracy of the learned CE models by 178 times, leading to a 10 times decrease in the end-to-end performance of the target database.</description>

      <title>AutoCE: An Accurate and Efficient Model Advisor for Learned Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CE) plays a crucial role in many database-related tasks such as query generation, cost estimation, and join ordering. Lately, we have witnessed the emergence of numerous learned CE models. However, no single CE model is invincible when it comes to the datasets with various data distributions. To facilitate data-intensive applications with accurate and efficient cardinality estimation, it is important to have an approach that can judiciously and efficiently select the most suitable CE model for an arbitrary dataset.
  In this paper, we study a new problem of selecting the best CE models for a variety of datasets. This problem is rather challenging as it is hard to capture the relationship from various datasets to the performance of disparate models. To address this problem, we propose a model advisor, named AutoCE, which can adaptively select the best model for a dataset. The main contribution of AutoCE is the learning-based model selection, where deep metric learning is used to learn a recommendation model and incremental learning is proposed to reduce the labeling overhead and improve the model robustness. We have integrated AutoCE into PostgreSQL and evaluated its impact on query optimization. The results showed that AutoCE achieved the best performance (27% better) and outperformed the baselines concerning accuracy (2.1 times better) and efficacy (4.2 times better).</description>
