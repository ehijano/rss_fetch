      <title>Organic Hydrogen Sensors for Potential Use in Safety-Critical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate monitoring of the hydrogen concentration is critical for optimizing fuel cell performance, minimizing purge losses, and reducing long-term degradation. Conventional hydrogen sensors often rely on catalytic materials and face limitations such as the need of oxygen purging when operated in fuel cell environments. Here, we report the discovery of a novel hydrogen-sensing mechanism based on organic molecules, without the use of catalytic metals. The sensor is based on a typical vertical stack geometry, containing $\mathrm{Alq_3}$ as active organic material. Upon exposure to hydrogen, the device shows an increase in resistivity, yielding a reliable sensor signal that varies linearly with hydrogen concentration, temperature, and humidity, and exhibits a relative response of up to 3.5 % at 100 %vol hydrogen. By exposing the sensor to an external magnetic field, the rise and fall times of the sensor response were found to be tunable. This novel organic sensor demonstrates sensitivity across a wide range of hydrogen concentrations under fuel cell-relevant conditions and beyond. This new class of hydrogen sensors with high miniaturization potential and cost efficiency paves the way for real-time hydrogen monitoring and advanced control strategies in fuel cells, the chemical industry, or energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>A scalability benchmark study of model order reduction techniques for very large, strongly coupled vibroacoustic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Order Reduction (MOR) can significantly reduce the computational cost of vibroacoustic simulations. While most MOR research focuses on single-domain systems (e.g., structural dynamics or computational fluid mechanics), this work compares MOR techniques for large multi-domain problems to identify methods that remain efficient and accurate at very large scales. In particular, harmonic response simulations of vibroacoustic fluid-structure coupled systems used to compute transfer functions from an input force to either structural acceleration or pressure in the heavy fluid domain are of high interest. To achieve this, the most common MOR techniques based on modal methods and Krylov subspace methods are compared for multi-material systems. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of these techniques for different system sizes, a scalable benchmark model of a water-filled Plexiglass cylinder is developed, with mesh sizes from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). The quality of the models is assured by validation against experimental data. The geometry, model data, and experimental results are made available so that they can be used as a benchmark for further studies. For systems larger than 100,000 DOF, the investigated modal methods become impractical due to memory limitations, even on powerful workstations. Among the tested techniques, a Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction, combined with symmetrization and conditioning of the system matrices, provides the most accurate and efficient approximation of the target transfer functions - particularly for large-scale models up to 1,000,000 DOF. This approach achieves a speedup of up to 600 times compared to the full model.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth optimization, measurement and theoretical analysis of strain-compensated QCL grown on (511)A InP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface roughness scattering is an important limiting factor for achieving high performance Quantum Cascade Lasers. Following recent results, we study the growth conditions for a strain-compensated QCL emitting around 4.6 {\mu}m grown on a (511)A InP substrate using AFM and XRD measurements. We find that modulating the arsenic flux and correctly tailoring the III/V ratio is fundamental to achieve a good quality material. We report the first lasing device on such a platform with a current density threshold of 1.34 kA/cm2 and a slope efficiency of 1.1 W/A, which result suboptimal compared to the (100) reference. Finally, we find a 7% redshift of the (511)A spectrum which we attribute to an impurity scattering due to the increased incorporation along the exposed (111) direction. We validate this statement by verifying that the change in CBO and effective electron mass due to strain along a non-trivial direction cannot cause such a shift by using the k-p method generalized to arbitrary growth directions</description>

      <title>Advanced Superdirective Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superdirective (supergain) antennas aim to produce a narrow main beam from radiators that are electrically small compared with the wavelength. Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion.</description>

      <title>Observation of Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>A universal waveguide mass--energy relation for lossy one-dimensional waves in nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite, lossy waveguides are ubiquitous: distributed attenuation with partial reflections produces feedback, resonance, delays and decay across electromagnetic, acoustic, photonic, quantum-transport and electrochemical interfaces. Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\mathcal{U}^2-\mathcal{S}^2=|\Gamma_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|\Gamma_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|\Gamma_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems.</description>

      <title>Massive coherent equipartition of light by the geometric phase of null space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light source is a foundational to photonic science and technology. However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>ZnCdO:Eu Epitaxially Grown Alloys for Self-Powered Ultrafast Broadband Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photodetectors (PDs) are essential in imaging, communication, and sensing technologies. However, their reliance on external power makes them energy-consuming. This creates a strong need for self-powered PDs as a sustainable alternative. ZnO is a promising semiconductor material due to its pyroelectric properties, stemming from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite crystal structure, enabling the pyro-phototronic effect that enhances response speed. Properties of ZnO can be tailored via alloying and doping. Thus, this work explores thin layers of ZnCdO:Eu random alloys grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on silicon substrates, with varying Cd content. The study shows that doping with Eu notably affects growth kinetics, promoting strong [0001] orientation preference. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements confirm the successful incorporation of Eu3+ ions into the structure. Electrical measurements show that the introduction of Cd eliminates the problem of Schottky barrier formation on the ZnO/Si interface. The n-ZnCdO:Eu/p-Si junctions exhibit rectifying behavior and generate photocurrent across 380-1150 nm wavelength range without external electrical bias. Utilizing the pyro-phototronic effect, these devices achieved ultrafast response times: rise time below 10 us and decay time below 5 us for 405 nm and 650 nm illumination - placing them among the fastest self-powered oxide-based detectors that do not rely on additional performance-enhancing layers.</description>

      <title>Topological robustness of optical skyrmions through a real-world free-space link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured light offers a promising solution for the increasing data demands of modern optical networks, opening up new degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for greater channel capacity and more bits per photon. However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (&gt;98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of cyclic behavior in quasi-brittle materials: a micromechanics-based approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a micromechanics-based phase-field framework for fatigue fracture to incorporate cyclic plasticity with ratcheting. This mechanism is particularly relevant for low-cycle fatigue, where the accumulation of inelastic strains plays a critical role in the progression to final failure. An energetic formulation is proposed in which the ratcheting strain is explicitly incorporated into both the free energy and the dissipation potential. Ratcheting is modeled within a pressure-dependent, non-associative plasticity framework through the evolution of a ratcheting strain that progressively accumulates over loading cycles, capturing the characteristic inelastic strain growth of cyclic plasticity in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The plastic potential is formulated such that the deviatoric and volumetric components of ratcheting can be controlled independently. A staggered solution scheme is employed to solve for the internal variables, including the ratcheting strain. Numerical examples under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions are presented to evaluate the proposed model and to investigate the influence of ratcheting on the material response.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>

      <title>Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (&gt;2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Enhanced Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Solvent-Engineered MAPbBr$_3$ Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in neural stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link underlying microscopic tissue structure with macroscopic assumptions. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Conductivity variations within the cortex are expected given the differences in cell density and volume fraction across layers. We review recent efforts modeling microscopic and mesoscopic E-fields and outline approaches that bridge micro- and macroscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions. Using simplified microscopic models, effective tissue conductivity was estimated as a function of volume fraction of extracellular space, and the conductivities of different cortical layers were interpolated based on experimental volume fraction. The effective tissue conductivities were monotonically decreasing convex functions of the cell volume fraction. With decreasing cell volume fraction, the conductivity of cortical layers increased with depth from layer 2 to 6. Although the variation of conductivity within the cortex was small when compared to the conductivity of extracellular fluid (9% to 15%), the conductivity difference was considerably larger when compared between layers, e.g., with layer 3 and 6 being 20% and 50% more conductive than layer 2, respectively. The review and analysis provide a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural stimulation. Using layer-specific conductivity values within the cortex could improve the accuracy of estimations of thresholds and distributions of neural activation in E-field models of brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Broadband silicon polarization beam splitter based on Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) &gt; 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.</description>
