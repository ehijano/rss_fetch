      <title>Sputtered AlN buffer layer for low-loss crystalline AlN-on-sapphire integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, aluminum nitride (AlN) has emerged as an attractive material for integrated photonics due to its low propagation losses, wide transparency window, and presence of both second- and third-order optical nonlinearities. However, most of the research led on this platform has primarily focused on applications, rather than material optimization, although the latter is equally important to ensure its technological maturity. In this work, we show that voids, which are commonly found in crystalline AlN-on-sapphire epilayers, have a detrimental role in related photonic structures, as they can lead to propagation losses exceeding 30 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. Their impact on light propagation is further quantified through finite-difference time-domain simulations that reveal that void-related scattering losses are strongly dependent on their size and density in the layer. As a possible solution, we demonstrate that when introducing a thin sputtered AlN buffer layer prior to initiating AlN epitaxial growth, void-free layers are obtained. They exhibit intrinsic quality factors in microring resonators as high as $2.0\times 10^6$, corresponding to propagation losses lower than 0.2 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. These void-free layers are further benchmarked for high-power applications through second-harmonic and supercontinuum generation in dispersion-engineered waveguides. Such layers are highly promising candidates for short-wavelength photonic integrated circuit applications, particularly given the strong potential of AlN for visible photonics. Given that volumetric scattering losses scale as $\lambda^{-4}$, the platform quality becomes increasingly critical in the visible and ultraviolet range, where our improved layers are expected to deliver enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Self-focusing of high-intensity beams with grid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser beams with high optical power propagating in a Kerr medium can undergo self-focusing when their power exceeds a critical power determined by the optical properties of the medium. The highly concentrated energy close to the in the region of the self-focus can lead to other nonlinear phenomena and cause significant irreversible damage to the material. We propose a transverse grid beam structure that effectively suppresses self-focusing even in the absence of other competing effects through the redistribution of optical power by inter-beamlet nonlinear interaction. We find that a beam with a $N \times N$ grid structure with optimized lattice spacing undergoes a dimension-dependent multi-stage self-focusing. We also identify specific grid layouts that can increase the total transmitted power beyond that permitted by the critical level of self-focusing for each beamlet. Lastly, we derive a general numerical relation between the optimal grid lattice spacing and the size of beamlets. Our results could potentially inform the use of beam shaping to prevent damage to optical components in high-powered and directed-energy applications.</description>

      <title>Stokes microcombs in silicon nitride microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride microresonators have become an ubiquitous platform for cutting-edge photonics applications. Improvement in silicon nitride fabrication techniques, providing ultra-high quality-factor values up to $10^7$, has opened up new possibilities for nonlinear effects realizations in such structures. Here we report for the first time to our knowledge on the observation of the Stokes microcombs in silicon nitride on-chip microresonators exhibiting normal group velocity dispersion. Moreover, using different pump schemes, namely, a tunable laser with an isolator and a stabilized diode laser, we demonstrate on-chip stimulated Raman frequency combs including dark-pulse Raman states. We reveal a complex interplay between Kerr and Raman nonlinearities and elaborate effective method of controllable switching between predominantly Kerr-comb and predominantly Raman-comb operation. We prove the Raman-induced platicon formation by numerical model which shows perfect agreement with experimental results. These findings are of special importance for silicon nitride photonics and provide a basis for novel photonic devices.</description>

      <title>HAPS Communication Networks: A Tutorial-cum-Survey on Integration with Optical Atmospheric Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging as key enablers of future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), supporting gigabit-class free-space optical (FSO) backhaul links while hosting laser-based sensing payloads. This tutorial and survey reviews recent advances in HAPS optical communication and integration with atmospheric remote sensing via shared optical links. Among several sensing techniques, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is identified as most promising due to its range-resolved sensitivity, spectral selectivity, and compatibility with HAPS constraints. A roadmap is outlined for implementing telecom-band DIAL on HAPS alongside high-throughput FSO systems. The paper analyzes architectural and atmospheric advantages of HAPS over terrestrial and satellite nodes, emphasizing spatial-temporal coverage, station-keeping ability, and support for compact laser payloads such as DIAL, in-situ sensors, and multispectral imagers. It highlights the feasibility of co-locating sensing and communication within a shared optical and power envelope, especially in the telecom C-band (1.53-1.57 um), enabling trace-gas retrieval (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2S, O3) while maintaining multi-Gbps downlinks. Suitable HAPS architectures (balloons, UAVs, airships) and use cases are identified where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled HAPS outperform satellites and UAVs, including greenhouse gas monitoring, disaster response, air-quality mapping, and 6G NTN extensions. A literature survey for 2005-2025 shows HAPS publications have tripled since 2014, indicating rapid growth. The results confirm that optical hardware, favorable transmission windows, and active R&amp;D are positioning HAPS as a persistent stratospheric layer for 6G ISAC communications and environmental observation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Localized Optical Links and Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical links and knots have attracted growing attention owing to their exotic topologic features and promising applications in next-generation information transfer and storage. However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Achromatic Metalens for the Short-Wave Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1.8-2.3 {\mu}m band lies within the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region and serves as a key operational window for a wide range of applications, including quantum sensing, molecular spectroscopy, and free-space quantum and classical optical communication. Despite its significance, optical devices operating in this band still face two major challenges: chromatic aberration across the wide spectral range and the difficulty of integration due to bulky optical elements. Metalenses are composed of subwavelength nanostructures that locally control the phase and group delay of light, enabling precise wavefront shaping and broadband dispersion compensation. These capabilities make them highly promising for use in infrared optical systems, particularly in applications such as focusing and imaging for compact integrated devices. In this study, we propose a metalens design based on a CaF2 substrate, where each nanocell consists of a single-bar silicon structure. These nanocells are periodically arranged with a 900 nm period, enabling precise control of dispersion and phase. By systematically finetuning the bar length and width, the design enables simultaneous dispersion compensation and phase modulation, achieving stable focusing performance over a broad spectral range. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the metalens design achieves effective suppression of chromatic aberration in the 1800-2300 nm range, maintaining a stable focal position throughout the bandwidth with variation within 6% of the focal length. This design offers a compact, broadband, and high-performance approach for beam collimation and wavefront shaping in the SWIR band, with promising potential for applications in quantum communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling architectural and optoelectronic synergies in lead-free perovskite/perovskite/kesterite triple-junction monolithic tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Multiscale aperture synthesis imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture imaging has enabled breakthrough observations from radar to astronomy. However, optical implementation remains challenging due to stringent wavefield synchronization requirements among multiple receivers. Here we present the multiscale aperture synthesis imager (MASI), which utilizes parallelism to break complex optical challenges into tractable sub-problems. MASI employs a distributed array of coded sensors that operate independently yet coherently to surpass the diffraction limit of single receiver. It combines the propagated wavefields from individual sensors through a computational phase synchronization scheme, eliminating the need for overlapping measurement regions to establish phase coherence. Light diffraction in MASI naturally expands the imaging field, generating phase-contrast visualizations that are substantially larger than sensor dimensions. Without using lenses, MASI resolves sub-micron features at ultralong working distances and reconstructs 3D shapes over centimeter-scale fields. MASI transforms the intractable optical synchronization problem into a computational one, enabling practical deployment of scalable synthetic aperture systems at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Entropy mode driven gas optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of gaseous diffractive optical elements created by imprinting an entropy mode in a gas. Previous approaches to gaseous diffractive optics relied on the simultaneous excitation of a standing acoustic wave and an entropy mode to produce one-dimensional periodic structures. However, the presence of acoustic oscillations in the gas imposes stringent constraints on some operational parameters of these optical elements, such as their lifetime and diffraction angle. In this work, we introduce a new approach that eliminates the acoustic mode, relying solely on the entropy mode. This enables control of the lifetime and temporal profile of gaseous optical elements, and also allows the creation of arbitrary structures with greater contrast, including non-periodic patterns such as chirped gratings or lenses. This approach should allow operation over a wider parameter space, including larger diffraction angles and compatibility with laser pulse durations ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution with Fourier measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</description>

      <title>Deep-ultraviolet ptychographic pocket-scope (DART): mesoscale lensless molecular imaging with label-free spectroscopic contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mesoscale characterization of biological specimens has traditionally required compromises between resolution, field-of-view, depth-of-field, and molecular specificity, with most approaches relying on external labels. Here we present the Deep-ultrAviolet ptychogRaphic pockeT-scope (DART), a handheld platform that transforms label-free molecular imaging through intrinsic deep-ultraviolet spectroscopic contrast. By leveraging biomolecules' natural absorption fingerprints and combining them with lensless ptychographic microscopy, DART resolves down to 308-nm linewidths across centimeter-scale areas while maintaining millimeter-scale depth-of-field. The system's virtual error-bin methodology effectively eliminates artifacts from limited temporal coherence and other optical imperfections, enabling high-fidelity molecular imaging without lenses. Through differential spectroscopic imaging at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths, DART quantitatively maps nucleic acid and protein distributions with femtogram sensitivity, providing an intrinsic basis for explainable virtual staining. We demonstrate DART's capabilities through molecular imaging of tissue sections, cytopathology specimens, blood cells, and neural populations, revealing detailed molecular contrast without external labels. The combination of high-resolution molecular mapping and broad mesoscale imaging in a portable platform opens new possibilities from rapid clinical diagnostics, tissue analysis, to biological characterization in space exploration.</description>

      <title>Video-rate gigapixel ptychography via space-time neural field representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving gigapixel space-bandwidth products (SBP) at video rates represents a fundamental challenge in imaging science. Here we demonstrate video-rate ptychography that overcomes this barrier by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations through neural field representations. Our approach factorizes the space-time volume into low-rank spatial and temporal features, transforming SBP scaling from sequential measurements to efficient correlation extraction. The architecture employs dual networks for decoding real and imaginary field components, avoiding phase-wrapping discontinuities plagued in amplitude-phase representations. A gradient-domain loss on spatial derivatives ensures robust convergence. We demonstrate video-rate gigapixel imaging with centimeter-scale coverage while resolving 308-nm linewidths. Validations span from monitoring sample dynamics of crystals, bacteria, stem cells, microneedle to characterizing time-varying probes in extreme ultraviolet experiments, demonstrating versatility across wavelengths. By transforming temporal variations from a constraint into exploitable correlations, we establish that gigapixel video is tractable with single-sensor measurements, making ptychography a high-throughput sensing tool for monitoring mesoscale dynamics without lenses.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Upconverted Full-Stokes Imaging with High-Efficiency Germanium Metasurface from MWIR to SWIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can be utilized for efficient high harmonic generation, which has been explored here in this effort for a high-efficient Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33-micron wavelength by the third harmonic generation (THG) from the 4-micron fundamental wavelength. The internal TH conversion efficiency for the Ge film is about 1x10-5 % to 5.6x10-3 % and for the Ge-metasurface 1.5x10-4 % to 1.05x10-1 % for linearly polarized (LP) incidence, and 1.3x10-4 % to 6.1x10-2 % for circularly polarized (CP) incidence, for the optical intensity range 0.47 GW/cm2 to 16.8 GW/cm2 respectively. The effect of the Ge film height variation has been discussed and compared with transmission line theory for the nonlinear medium. The metasurface design pitch is suitably tuned for the anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantenna for analyzing the polarization states of the fundamental beam simultaneously. The effect of source intensity on TH conversion among the LP and CP states, flipping the nonlinear diffraction orders and incipient of new harmonics with intensity dependence and design limitations, has also been addressed. To my knowledge, with this type of metasurface design, this is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging. The benefit will be upconverted polarimetry of MWIR at SWIR, where uncooled efficient detectors are available for high-resolution thermal imaging. This efficient Ge-metasurface is exempt from TH transmission loss due to the size effect of assigning a phase gradient for polarization-dependent TH diffraction order generation and orthogonal transmission disparity. Integration of this type of metasurface for infrared image upconversion will open new possibilities for intense heat signature identification, especially for target recognition in next-generation infrared homing devices in surveillance and missile defense systems.</description>

      <title>Pulse duration retrieval using a commercial laser diode with a monitor photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers merge coherent light emission with photodetection and, owing to third-order nonlinearities in their active region, function as sensitive room temperature two-photon absorption (TPA) detectors. Here, we leverage these capabilities offered by a commercially available InGaAsP semiconductor laser diode with an integrated InGaAs monitor photodiode to measure the duration of femtosecond pulses at telecom wavelengths. The nonlinear and linear signals obtained from both detectors enable the retrieval of pulse duration with femtosecond accuracy without moving parts. This capability is demonstrated down to 2 $\mu$W average optical power for a 250 MHz repetition rate laser.</description>

      <title>Freespace twistronics for optical supertopologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics, the study of moir\'e superlattices of twisted bilayer 2D materials creating nontrivial physical effects, has recently revolutionized diverse subjects from materials to optoelectronics, nanophotonics, and beyond. Here, breaking the reliance on materials, we present twistronics in higher-dimensional free space, where the twisted lattice is not a layer of 2D material but a 3D propagating light field with topological textures. Moir\'e structured light with a twist angle can generate a rich set of high-dimensional topologies, including skyrmionium bags, skyrmion bag superlattices, skyrmion clusters, and optical quasicrystals, with controllable symmetry. Many of these textures have not been reported before. Importantly, in contrast to prior moir\'e superlattices, our freespace optical moir\'e textures maintain their topologies over a long propagation distances, showing nondiffractive behavior and robustness against perturbations and obstacles. Our work unlocks higher dimensions to manipulate moir\'e photonics with high-capacity topologies to address modern challenges of robust information transfer and encryption.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Antenna-Modulator Integration for Monolithic Photonic RF Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated radio-frequency (RF) photonics plays a pivotal role in wireless communications, sensing, and radar due to its large intrinsic bandwidth, remote distribution capability, and compact footprint. However, despite significant advances in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), the practical deployment of these systems remains constrained by the bulky nature of essential RF components (e.g., bulky antennas, amplifiers, and cables), especially in covert, conformal, and space-constrained applications. To overcome these limitations, monolithic electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs), enabling miniaturized and synergistic integration of both RF and photonic components, are gaining notable attention. As a groundbreaking advancement, we demonstrate a novel photonic RF receiver that monolithically integrates a bow-tie antenna and a microring modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. The chip innovatively leverages dual-resonance enhancement mechanism, RF resonance from the antenna and optical resonance from the microring, to significantly boost the RF-to-optical conversion efficiency. A record-high figure of merit (FOM) of 3.88 W-1/2 is achieved within a compact footprint of 2*1.7 mm2. As the first demonstrations, the integrated receiver is deployed in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, achieving centimeter-level radar ranging accuracy and 3.2 Gbps wireless communication capacity, as well as real-time video transmission function in moving scenarios. This seminal work paves a new way for covert, conformal, and miniaturized frontends in wireless communication and sensing applications, including body area networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed vacuum maglevs, and electronic warfare systems.</description>

      <title>Deep learning EPI-TIRF cross-modality enables background subtraction and axial super-resolution for widefield fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolving ability of wide-field fluorescence microscopy is fundamentally limited by out-of-focus background owing to its low axial resolution, particularly for densely labeled biological samples. To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor for efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus in the near-infrared region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a high-performance, multilayered surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensor designed to enhance performance parameters in the near-infrared (NIR) region through angular interrogation. The multi-layered sensor consists of a bimetallic layer (Aluminum (Al) &amp; Gold (Au)), a dielectric layer (MgF2), and an optimized number of 2D nanomaterial (MoS2) layers. The proposed SPR sensor is numerically designed and analyzed through simulation using the transfer matrix and finite element methods to achieve high sensitivity, figure of merit (FOM), and detection accuracy. The simulated results revealed that the proposed plasmonic sensor (Glass prism/Al/Au/MgF2/MoS2/sensing sample) exhibits a maximum sensitivity of 372{\deg}/RIU, FOM of 1690.90 RIU-1, and detection accuracy of 4.54 degree-1. The outcomes from this work indicate that the developed SPR sensor exhibits excellent detection capabilities for refractive index changes, including those caused by the novel coronavirus, making it a promising prospect for biosensing applications.</description>

      <title>Integrated soliton microcombs beyond the turnkey limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in optical microresonators are accelerating the transition of optical frequency combs from laboratory instruments to industrial platforms. Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Topological Transitions Driven by Permittivity Modulation in Non-Hermitian Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast permittivity modulation in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media provides a pathway for real-time control of non-Hermitian photonic topology. We model ultrafast topological dynamics in an ITO/SiO$_2$/Ag multilayer supporting hybrid epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-plasmon modes. Using a time-dependent Drude-Lorentz permittivity for ITO and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, it is found that carrier relaxation with a 10-ps time constant redshifts the ENZ resonance from 490 to 525~nm and shifts the reflection-phase singularities across the angle--wavelength plane. The motion of these singularities corresponds to the displacement of exceptional points and a discrete change in the cumulative winding number. The transient Floquet-like band structure exhibits avoided crossings and Dirac-type dispersions driven by ENZ modulation. The results directly link picosecond-scale permittivity dynamics to quantized topological transitions in non-Hermitian photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Light Focusing through Dynamic Media via Real-Valued Intensity Transmission Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise light delivery through biological tissue is essential for deep-tissue imaging and phototherapeutic applications. Wavefront shaping enables control over scattered light by modulating the incident wavefront, but its application in living tissue is hindered by tissue-induced temporal decorrelation. This study systematically investigated the real-valued intensity transmission matrix (RVITM), a high-speed wavefront shaping method, for light focusing across a broad range of speckle decorrelation times. The inherent trade-off between static light focusing enhancement and implementation speed is characterized, which provided practical guidelines for implementing RVITM in real-time wavefront shaping under varying dynamic conditions. Effective optical focusing using a RVITM with 33 ms runtime was achieved through porcine liver with decorrelation times as short as 13 ms, demonstrating feasibility for biologically relevant dynamics and supporting the development of adaptive, non-invasive optical control for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Transformation Optics: A Unified Framework for Energy and Entropy with Application to the Casimir Force in Dissipative Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel idea, Quantum Thermodynamic Transformation Optics (QTTO), is introduced in this article. This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.
  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments.</description>

      <title>Fano-Like Resonances in Coupled Sagnac Interferometers Formed by a Self-Coupled Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate Fano-like resonances in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowire-based coupled Sagnac interferometers (SIs) formed by a self-coupled waveguide. By adjusting the reflectivity of the two SIs and coupling strength between them, we tailor coherent mode interference to achieve high-performance optical analogues of Fano resonance. The device is theoretically analyzed and experimentally fabricated on a SOI platform. Theoretical analysis predicts periodic Fano-like resonances with a high extinction ratio and a steep slope rate, arising from strong coherent optical mode interference within a compact resonator comprising two SIs and a connected feedback waveguide. Experimental results align with the theoretical model, validating the expected resonance behavior and confirming the effectiveness of the design. These findings underscore the potential of compact coupled SIs for generating Fano-like resonances, enabling broader applications in integrated photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics can be used to break time reversal symmetry and is important for interactions in a wide range of systems, from active matter and neural networks to metamaterials and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In integrated photonic devices, non-Hermitian physics can be used for direction-dependent light propagation, reconfigurable light paths, selective energy localization and optical isolators. In this work, we report previously unexplored direction-dependent mode splitting in ring microresonators, achieved by adding multiple scatterers around the cavity. Through experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we unveil the underlying physics that changes the resonance shapes in resonant systems with backscattering. By engineering the spatial configuration of the scatterers, we can produce a predictable and repeatable direction-dependent mode splitting, enabling new ways to route light through optical resonators and photonic networks. In addition, the direction dependent mode-splitting can be used for precise near-field measurements, enhancing traditional sensing in integrated photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase metasurfaces for linearly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase is a universal concept in modern physics and has enabled the development of metasurfaces for versatile wavefront shaping. However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Directional Random Lasing in Liquid Crystal Infiltrated Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random lasers (RL) emit light through multiple scattering in disordered gain media, typically resulting in isotropic emission with limited directionality control. Controlling RL emission direction in compact systems remains a challenge. Here we report directional random lasing achieved by infiltrating dye-doped nematic liquid crystals into a nanostructured silica metasurface. By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications.</description>

      <title>GiBS: Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing large-scale metasurfaces with nonlocal optical effects remains challenging due to the immense dimensionality and fabrication constraints of conventional optimization methods. We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic wave enabled all-optical determination of the interlayer elastic constants of van der Waals interface</title>

Abstract: Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits to Phase and Amplitude Estimation in the High-Strehl Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Ground-based telescopes are susceptible to seeing, an atmospheric phenomenon that reduces the resolving power of large observatories to that of a home telescope. Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.
  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.
  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.
  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nanophotonic Interface for Tin-Vacancy Centers in Thin-Film Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be {\eta}BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.</description>

      <title>Compressive multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with beam distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.</description>

      <title>Photodiode quantum efficiency for 2-{\mu}m light in the signal band of gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 {\mu}m. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-{\mu}m laser light.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical neural networks using atom-cavity interactions to provide all-optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</description>

      <title>Biphoton state generation and engineering with bright hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.</description>

      <title>Superposition- and interference-induced optical spectrum distortion in the figure-9 fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The output pulse spectra of the figure-8 and figure-9 lasers typically exhibit more pronounced distortion than those from mode-locked lasers based on other saturable absorbers, as well as the spectra of their own intracavity pulses. Here, we demonstrate two figure-9 lasers with repetition rates of 190.6 MHz and 92.4 MHz and introduce a self-designed beam splitter that exhibits minimal spectral filtering into the fiber loop to output two interference-free pulses. By applying superposition and interference calculations to the experimental spectra of these two pulses, we obtained calculated spectra and found that their characteristics agree with the distortion features observed in the experimental spectra from the other two ports where superposition and interference occur. Therefore, we conclude that the severe spectral distortion is caused by spectral superposition and interference, rather than the commonly believed nonlinear effects. Furthermore, analysis based on the interference theory of the figure-9 laser reveals that the $p$-components of the two intracavity light beams usually interfere with non-equal intensity at the beam splitter where interference occurs, while the $s$-components always interferes with almost equal intensity. This mechanism results in a significant yet stable spectral difference between the intracavity and output pulses. Moreover, a change in the pump power can amplify the difference between the two $s$-components, thereby leading to the emergence of a minor peak at the optical spectrum center. These findings provide new perspectives for simulating spectra that closely resemble experimental results and deepen our understanding of spectral evolution and pulse dynamics of the figure-9 lasers.</description>

      <title>Shell-Core Structural Anisotropy in Starch Granules Probed by Polarization Third-Harmonic Generation Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lately the non-linear optical third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy is starting to emerge as a laboratory standard for label-free studies in biological samples. In this study, the THG signals produced from corn starch granules are investigated. In particular, the polarization-dependent THG (P-THG) signals emerging from the outer layer (shell) of the starch granules are compared with the P-THG signals originating from their inner portion (core). By rotating the linear polarization of the excitation beam, two distinct P-THG modulation patterns are revealed within single granules, corresponding to their shells and to their structurally different cores. These patterns are analyzed using a theoretical framework, that describes THG from an orthorhombic crystal symmetry, characteristic of corn starch. This allows us to extract point-by-point in the granules the ratios of the \c{hi}^(3) susceptibility tensor elements and the average molecular orientations. Then, the anisotropy ratio (AR=\c{hi}_xxxx^((3) )/\c{hi}_yyyy^((3) ) is defined and used as a quantitative descriptor of the local molecular arrangements. Our results show that the shells and cores exhibit distinct AR values, probing the anisotropy in the molecular arrangements between the two regions. This study establishes P-THG as a powerful contrast mechanism for probing structural anisotropy in biological samples beyond conventional THG intensity-only microscopy.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Complex-Valued Deformable CNN for High-Quality Computer-Generated Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic displays have significant potential in virtual reality and augmented reality owing to their ability to provide all the depth cues. Deep learning-based methods play an important role in computer-generated holography (CGH). During the diffraction process, each pixel exerts an influence on the reconstructed image. However, previous works face challenges in capturing sufficient information to accurately model this process, primarily due to the inadequacy of their effective receptive field (ERF). Here, we designed complex-valued deformable convolution for integration into network, enabling dynamic adjustment of the convolution kernel's shape to increase flexibility of ERF for better feature extraction. This approach allows us to utilize a single model while achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and optical experiment reconstructions, surpassing existing open-source models. Specifically, our method has a peak signal-to-noise ratio that is 2.04 dB, 5.31 dB, and 9.71 dB higher than that of CCNN-CGH, HoloNet, and Holo-encoder, respectively, when the resolution is 1920$\times$1072. The number of parameters of our model is only about one-eighth of that of CCNN-CGH.</description>

      <title>Direct Reconstruction of Terahertz-driven Subcycle Electron Emission Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While field-driven electron emission is theoretically understood down to the subcycle regime, its direct experimental temporal characterization using long-wavelength terahertz (THz) fields remains elusive. Here, by driving a graphite tip with phase-stable quasi-single-cycle THz pulses, we reveal distinct subcycle electron emission dynamics including: (1) At a carrier-envelope phase (CEP) zero, spectral peaks scale linearly with THz field strength, characteristic of subcycle emission; (2) At nearly opposite CEP, dominant deceleration fields generate stationary low-energy peaks. Crucially, we develop a pump-probe-free, direct reconstruction method extracting electron pulse profiles solely from measured energy spectra, obtaining durations from 73.0 to 81.0 fs as the field increases (191-290 kV/cm). Phase-resolved simulations further reveal a 72.8% modulation in the cutoff energy and a near-total (99.7%) suppression of the emission current. This work not only validates the field-emisssion theory under THz excitation but also establishes a general framework for the direct temporal characterization of subcycle electron emission, opening pathways for precise electron control in ultrafast electron sources and lightwave nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Sensitive and accurate femtosecond pulse characterization via two-photon absorption in Fabry-P\'erot laser diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers offer native bifunctionality enabling coherent light emission and linear photodetection. They can also operate as sensitive two-photon absorption detectors due to the third-order nonlinearity of the heterostructure constituting the active region. The strong two-photon response at room temperature is highly desired in ultrafast optics, where such detectors are used for interferometric characterization of femtosecond light pulses for shape and duration. Another niche is pulse detection in dual-comb ranging. While prior studies have focused on the two-photon response of commercial photodiodes or proprietary semiconductor microcavities for intensity autocorrelation measurements, a systematic analysis of the semiconductor lasers ability to accurately characterize the optical pulse width is missing. To address this niche, here we measure autocorrelation traces of femtosecond pulses with varying durations from sub 55 fs to 260 fs at the common 1.5 $\mu$m wavelength using AlGaAs and InGaAsP laser diodes designed to operate at emission wavelengths of 0.95 $\mu$m and 1.3 $\mu$m, respectively. We validate the obtained waveforms using a silicon avalanche photodetector and conventional crystal-based second-harmonic autocorrelator. We consider the effects of optical polarization, operation mode and electrical load resistance on the shape and intensity of generated electrical signals. Our results prove the suitability of Fabry-P\'erot laser structures for interferometric autocorrelation measurements of 53 $\mu$W (220 fJ pulse energy) average power pulses as short as 36 fs with a mean square error of 7 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points unveiled by nilpotence and mathematical induction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can have peculiar degeneracies of eigenstates called exceptional points (EPs). An EP of $n$ degenerate states is said to have order $n$, and higher-order EPs (HEPs) with $n \ge 3$ exhibit intrinsic order-scaling responses potentially applied to superior sensing and state control. However, traditional eigenvalue-based searches for HEPs are facing fundamental limitations in terms of complexity and implementation. Here, we propose a design paradigm for HEPs based on a simple property for matrices termed nilpotence and concise inductive procedure. The nilpotence guarantees a HEP with desired order and helps divide the problem. Our inductive scheme repeatedly extends a system and doubles its EP order, starting with a known design. Based on the nilpotence, we systematically design photonic cavity arrays operating at chiral, passive, and active HEPs with $n = 3, 6, 7$ and show their peculiar directional radiation, induced transparency, and enhanced transmittance and spontaneous emission, respectively. We inductively find lattice systems with diverging EP order originating from a well-known $2 \times 2$ parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonian. We also extend the active HEP system with $n = 7$ to another with $n = 14$ and have further magnified responses. Our work pushes the investigation and application of HEPs to previously unexplored regimes in various physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and experimentally implement Fourier-plane phase synchronization for optical microscopy, and demonstrate its performance with interferometric scattering microscopy. By combining a photothermal phase plate and laser beam scanning, we realize a synchronized phase for all scattering components on the Fourier plane of high numerical-aperture microscopes, where the evanescent waves and optical aberration normally produce highly inhomogeneous phase distributions. We achieve an almost perfect point spread function, exhibiting a tighter focus with 50\% enhancement of the signal and ideal circular symmetry. Particularly, by synchronizing the phase to $\pi/2$, we demonstrate the background speckles exhibit an anti-symmetric dependence on axial defocus, enabling the effective suppression of the speckles via defocus integration and thus the detection of 10 nm particles immobilized on the substrate. The concept and technique of seamless dynamic phase control on the Fourier plane constitute a key asset for modern optical microscopy.</description>

Abstract: Interferometric scattering microscopy was widely applied in nanoscopic detection and tracking due to its high sensitivity and label-free manner. The sensitivity is limited by contrast. Oblique illumination provided high contrast with lower power density. However, no model has been established to illustrate the schematic and complex rotation setup was needed. Here, we established a model of contrast and the unexpected reflections both in intensity and phase modulation. Then, the contrast enhancement was verified in oblique illumination. To provide a uniform contrast measurement, the phase map of oblique illumination was calibrated through scanning without the need for rotation. Our work gives new insights in oblique illumination and may inspire new idea to enhance contrast with phase and intensity modulation.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz and Bell Inequality Violations in Coupled Optomechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</description>

      <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Raman Microspectroscopy for Real-Time Structure Indicator in Ultrafast Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser fabrication enables the creation of a wide range of devices, but its scalability and yield can be limited by the lack of real-time, in-situ monitoring tools. In particular, there is a strong need for metrics that directly correlate with device performance. Raman microspectroscopy provides a non-destructive route for in-situ characterization. Here, we demonstrate its potential to assess the electrical performance of laser-written graphitic electrodes in diamond. By combining hyperspectral mapping with electrical testing, we show that depletion of the 1332 cm$^{-1}$ sp3 Raman line serves as a monotonic and robust predictor of resistance, offering clear advantages over commonly used spectral features. We further introduce hyperspectral unmixing as a label-free approach to identify relevant spectral signatures in fabrication processes where Raman markers are less defined. Importantly, the methodology we present is not restricted to diamond but can be adapted to other host materials and functionalities, offering a practical path toward specification-driven fs-laser microfabrication.</description>
