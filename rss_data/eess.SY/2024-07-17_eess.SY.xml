      <title>Time Shift Governor for Constrained Control of Spacecraft Orbit and Attitude Relative Motion in Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers constrained spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD) in the setting of the Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem (BCR4BP), while accounting for attitude dynamics. We consider Line of Sight (LoS) cone constraints, thrust limits, thrust direction limits, and approach velocity constraints during RVD missions in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in the Sun-Earth-Moon system. To enforce the constraints, the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which uses a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target reference for the Deputy spacecraft, is employed. The time shift is gradually reduced to zero so that the virtual target gradually evolves towards the Chief spacecraft as time goes by, and the RVD mission objective can be achieved. Numerical simulation results are reported to validate the proposed control method.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Controlled Invariant Sets for Gaussian Process State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute probabilistic controlled invariant sets for nonlinear systems using Gaussian process state space models, which are data-driven models that account for unmodeled and unknown nonlinear dynamics. We investigate the relationship between robust and probabilistic invariance, leveraging this relationship to design state-feedback controllers that maximize the probability of the system staying within the probabilistic controlled invariant set. We propose a semi-definite-programming-based optimization scheme for designing the state-feedback controllers subject to input constraints. The effectiveness of our results are demonstrated and validated on a quadrotor, both in simulation and on a physical platform.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event-triggered Control with Sampled Transmitted Output and Controller Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event-triggered control with intermittent output can reduce the communication burden between the controller and plant side over the network. It has been exploited for adaptive output feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems in the literature, however the controller must partially reside at the plant side where the computation capacity is required. In this paper, all controller components are moved to the controller side and their dynamics use sampled states rather than continuous one with the benefit of directly estimating next triggering instance of some conditions and avoiding constantly checking event condition at the controller side. However, these bring two major challenges. First, the virtual input designed in the dynamic filtering technique for the stabilization is no longer differentiable. Second, the plant output is sampled to transmit at plant side and sampled again at controller side to construct the controller, and the two asynchronous samplings make the analysis more involving. This paper solves these two issues by introducing a new state observer to simplify the adaptive law, a set of continuous companion variables for stability analysis and a new lemma quantifying the error bound between actual output signal and sampled transmitted output.
  It is theoretically guaranteed that all internal signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded and the output is practically stabilized to the origin. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Sensing, Communication, and Computation: Perspectives, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming 6G networks have two predominant features of wide coverage and sufficient computation capability. To support the promising applications, Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC) has been considered as a vital enabler by completing the computation of raw data to achieve accurate environmental sensing. To help the ISCC networks better support the comprehensive services of radar detection, data transmission and edge computing, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can be employed to boost the transmission rate and the wireless coverage by smartly tuning the electromagnetic characteristics of the environment. In this article, we propose an RIS-assisted ISCC framework and exploit the RIS benefits for improving radar sensing, communication and computing functionalities via cross-layer design, while discussing the key challenges. Then, two generic application scenarios are presented, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles and Internet of vehicles. Finally, numerical results demonstrate a superiority of RIS-assisted ISCC, followed by a range of future research directions.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-time Cooperative Output Regulation of Linear Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-time protocol for a multi-agent systems (MASs) can guarantee the convergence of every agent in a finite time interval in contrast to the asymptotic convergence, but the settling time depends on the initial condition and design parameters and is inconsistent across the agents. In this paper, we study the prescribed-time cooperative output regulation (PTCOR) problem for a class of linear heterogeneous MASs under a directed communication graph, where the settling time of every agent can be specified a priori and thus consistent. As a special case of PTCOR, the necessary and sufficient condition for prescribed-time output regulation of an individual system is first discussed. Then, the PTCOR problem is converted into two cascaded subsystem, where the first one composed of distributed estimate errors and local estimate errors and the second one is for
  local tracking errors.
  The criterion for prescribed-time stabilization of the cascaded system is proposed and is found to be different from that of traditional asymptotic stabilization of a cascaded system. Under the criterion and sufficient condition, the general PTCOR problem is studied in two scenarios including state feedback control and measurement output feedback control. In particular, a distributed prescribed-time observer for each subsystem is explicitly constructed to estimate the exosystem's state. Based on the observer, a distributed controller is proposed to achieve convergence of the regulated output to zero within a prescribed-time.</description>

      <title>Finite State Machines-Based Path-Following Collaborative Computing Strategy for Emergency UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offloading services to UAV swarms for delay-sensitive tasks in Emergency UAV Networks (EUN) can greatly enhance rescue efficiency. Most task-offloading strategies assumed that UAVs were location-fixed and capable of handling all tasks. However, in complex disaster environments, UAV locations often change dynamically, and the heterogeneity of on-board resources presents a significant challenge in optimizing task scheduling in EUN to minimize latency. To address these problems, a Finite state machines-based Path-following Collaborative computation strategy (FPC) for emergency UAV swarms is proposed. First, an Extended Finite State Machine Space-time Graph (EFSMSG) model is constructed to accurately characterize on-board resources and state transitions while shielding the EUN dynamic characteristic. Based on the EFSMSG, a mathematical model is formulated for the FPC strategy to minimize task processing delay while facilitating computation during transmission. Finally, the Constraint Selection Adaptive Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (CSABPSO) algorithm is proposed for the solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPC strategy effectively reduces task processing delay, meeting the requirements of delay-sensitive tasks in emergency situations.</description>

      <title>Imitation learning with artificial neural networks for demand response with a heuristic control approach for heat pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flexibility of electrical heating devices can help address the issues arising from the growing presence of unpredictable renewable energy sources in the energy system. In particular, heat pumps offer an effective solution by employing smart control methods that adjust the heat pump's power output in reaction to demand response signals. This paper combines imitation learning based on an artificial neural network with an intelligent control approach for heat pumps. We train the model using the output data of an optimization problem to determine the optimal operation schedule of a heat pump. The objective is to minimize the electricity cost with a time-variable electricity tariff while keeping the building temperature within acceptable boundaries. We evaluate our developed novel method, PSC-ANN, on various multi-family buildings with differing insulation levels that utilize an underfloor heating system as thermal storage. The results show that PSC-ANN outperforms a positively evaluated intelligent control approach from the literature and a conventional control approach. Further, our experiments reveal that a trained imitation learning model for a specific building is also applicable to other similar buildings without the need to train it again with new data. Our developed approach also reduces the execution time compared to optimally solving the corresponding optimization problem. PSC-ANN can be integrated into multiple buildings, enabling them to better utilize renewable energy sources by adjusting their electricity consumption in response to volatile external signals.</description>

      <title>Reachset-Conformant System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification techniques play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of complex cyber-physical systems. To transfer model-based verification results to the real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in the set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to as reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those reachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant identification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these methods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output models. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of prior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of model uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model uncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box models from data. For the black-box identification, we propose a new genetic programming variant, which we call conformant genetic programming. The robustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Pareto local search for a multi-objective demand response problem in residential areas with heat pumps and electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future energy systems characterized by significant shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources, there is a need for a fundamental change in electricity consumption. The energy system requires the ability to adapt to the intermittent electricity generation of renewable energy sources. This can be achieved by integrating flexible electrical loads, such as electric heating devices and electric vehicles, in combination with efficient control methods. In this paper, we introduce the Pareto local search method PALSS with heuristic search operations to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of a residential area with different types of flexible loads. PALSS shifts the flexible electricity load with the objective of minimizing the electricity cost and peak load while maintaining the inhabitants' comfort in favorable ranges. Further, we include reinforcement learning into the heuristic search operations in the approach RELAPALSS and use the dichotomous method for obtaining all Pareto-optimal solutions of the multi-objective optimization problem with conflicting goals. The methods are evaluated in simulations with different configurations of the residential area. The results show that PALSS and RELAPALSS strongly outperform the two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA-II from the literature and the conventional control approach. The inclusion of reinforcement learning in RELAPALSS leads to additional improvements. Our study reveals the need for multi-objective optimization methods to utilize renewable energy sources in residential areas.</description>

      <title>Exploring the 6G Potentials: Immersive, Hyper Reliable, and Low-Latency Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless telecommunications networks introduces significant challenges for researchers and industry stakeholders. The 6G technology aims to enhance existing usage scenarios, particularly supporting innovative applications requiring stringent performance metrics. Among the key performance indicators (KPIs) for 6G, immersive throughput, hyper-reliability, and hyper-low latency must be achieved simultaneously in some critical applications to achieve the application requirements. However, this is challenging due to the conflicting nature of these KPIs. This article proposes a new service class of 6G as immersive, hyper reliable, and low-latency communication (IHRLLC), and introduces a potential network architecture to achieve the associated KPIs. Specifically, technologies such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (umMIMO)-aided terahertz (THz) communications, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are viewed as the key enablers for achieving immersive data rate and hyper reliability. Given the computational complexity involved in employing these technologies, and the challenges encountered in designing real-time algorithms for efficient resource allocation and management strategies as well as dynamic beamforming and tracking techniques, we also propose the involvement of other potential enabling technologies such as non-terrestrial networks (NTN), learn-to-optimize (L2O) and generative-AI (GenAI) technologies, quantum computing, and network digital twin (NDT) for limiting the latency.</description>

      <title>Combining Federated Learning and Control: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11069v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an overview of combining Federated Learning (FL) and control to enhance adaptability, scalability, generalization, and privacy in (nonlinear) control applications. Traditional control methods rely on controller design models, but real-world scenarios often require online model retuning or learning. FL offers a distributed approach to model training, enabling collaborative learning across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. By keeping data localized, FL mitigates concerns regarding privacy and security while reducing network bandwidth requirements for communication. This survey summarizes the state-of-the-art concepts and ideas of combining FL and control. The methodical benefits are further discussed, culminating in a detailed overview of expected applications, from dynamical system modeling over controller design, focusing on adaptive control, to knowledge transfer in multi-agent decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>SENTINEL: Securing Indoor Localization against Adversarial Attacks with Capsule Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for edge device powered location-based services in indoor environments, Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting has become popular, given the unavailability of GPS indoors. However, achieving robust and efficient indoor localization faces several challenges, due to RSS fluctuations from dynamic changes in indoor environments and heterogeneity of edge devices, leading to diminished localization accuracy. While advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in mitigating these phenomena, it remains an open problem. Additionally, emerging threats from adversarial attacks on ML-enhanced indoor localization systems, especially those introduced by malicious or rogue access points (APs), can deceive ML models to further increase localization errors. To address these challenges, we present SENTINEL, a novel embedded ML framework utilizing modified capsule neural networks to bolster the resilience of indoor localization solutions against adversarial attacks, device heterogeneity, and dynamic RSS fluctuations. We also introduce RSSRogueLoc, a novel dataset capturing the effects of rogue APs from several real-world indoor environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SENTINEL achieves significant improvements, with up to 3.5x reduction in mean error and 3.4x reduction in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks using simulated adversarial attacks. SENTINEL also achieves improvements of up to 2.8x in mean error and 2.7x in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks when evaluated with the real-world RSSRogueLoc dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of State-Triggered Linear Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear quadratic regulator is a famous application of optimal control theory. This class of control systems has linear dynamics (in both the state and control), while minimizing a quadratic cost. Upon application of Pontryagin's maximum principle, the co-states can be fully decoupled from the state which results in a matrix Riccati equation. As such, solutions can be found by solving this matrix equation backwards. The purpose of this work is to extend this analysis to systems with linear state jumps, which are referred to as linear hybrid systems. The extension of the maximum principle to these systems results in the ``hybrid maximum principle.'' However, successful application of this theory requires many subtle properties which are usually ignored - specifically beating/blocking and Zeno. It turns out that these phenomena occur in linear hybrid systems and as such, the hybrid maximum principle is not immediately applicable to these seemingly simple systems. We show that for spatially triggered linear hybrid systems, beating always occurs while blocking and Zeno can be successfully avoided if a certain controllability assumption is satisfied. For these trivially blocking systems, we develop conditions for optimality for the two cases of when beating is excluded and present. This work concluded with an example.</description>

      <title>Scenario Convex Programs for Dexterous Manipulation under Modeling Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new framework to design a controller for the dexterous manipulation of an object by a multi-fingered hand. To achieve a robust manipulation and wide range of operations, the uncertainties on the location of the contact point and multiple operating points are taken into account in the control design by sampling the state space. The proposed control strategy is based on a robust pole placement using LMIs. Moreover, to handle uncertainties and different operating points, we recast our problem as a robust convex program (RCP). We then consider the original RCP as a scenario convex program (SCP) and solve the SCP by sampling the uncertain grasp map parameter and operating points in the state space. For a required probabilistic level of confidence, we quantify the feasibility of the SCP solution based on the number of sampling points. The control strategy is tested in simulation in a case study with contact location error and different initial grasps.</description>

      <title>Distributed Prescribed-Time Convex Optimization: Cascade Design and Time-Varying Gain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed prescribed-time convex optimization (DPTCO) problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under undirected connected graph. A cascade design framework is proposed such that the DPTCO implementation is divided into two parts: distributed optimal trajectory generator design and local reference trajectory tracking controller design. The DPTCO problem is then transformed into the prescribed-time stabilization problem of a cascaded system. Changing Lyapunov function method and time-varying state transformation method together with the sufficient conditions are proposed to prove the prescribed-time stabilization of the cascaded system as well as the uniform boundedness of internal signals in the closed-loop systems. The proposed framework is then utilized to solve robust DPTCO problem for a class of chain-integrator MASs with external disturbances by constructing a novel variables and exploiting the property of time-varying gains. The proposed framework is further utilized to solve the adaptive DPTCO problem for a class of strict-feedback MASs with parameter uncertainty, in which backstepping method with prescribed-time dynamic filter is adopted. The descending power state transformation is introduced to compensate the growth of increasing rate induced by the derivative of time-varying gains in recursive steps and the high-order derivative of local reference trajectory is not required. Finally, theoretical results are verified by two numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a comprehensive approach to increase the reliability and resilience of future power grids rich in distributed energy resources. Our distributed scheme combines federated learning-based attack detection with a local electricity market-based attack mitigation method. We validate the scheme by applying it to a real-world distribution grid rich in solar PV. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach is feasible and can successfully mitigate the grid impacts of cyber-physical attacks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reachability Analysis of Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachability analysis is a popular method to give safety guarantees for stochastic cyber-physical systems (SCPSs) that takes in a symbolic description of the system dynamics and uses set-propagation methods to compute an overapproximation of the set of reachable states over a bounded time horizon. In this paper, we investigate the problem of performing reachability analysis for an SCPS that does not have a symbolic description of the dynamics, but instead is described using a digital twin model that can be simulated to generate system trajectories. An important challenge is that the simulator implicitly models a probability distribution over the set of trajectories of the SCPS; however, it is typical to have a sim2real gap, i.e., the actual distribution of the trajectories in a deployment setting may be shifted from the distribution assumed by the simulator. We thus propose a statistical reachability analysis technique that, given a user-provided threshold $1-\epsilon$, provides a set that guarantees that any reachable state during deployment lies in this set with probability not smaller than this threshold. Our method is based on three main steps: (1) learning a deterministic surrogate model from sampled trajectories, (2) conducting reachability analysis over the surrogate model, and (3) employing {\em robust conformal inference} using an additional set of sampled trajectories to quantify the surrogate model's distribution shift with respect to the deployed SCPS. To counter conservatism in reachable sets, we propose a novel method to train surrogate models that minimizes a quantile loss term (instead of the usual mean squared loss), and a new method that provides tighter guarantees using conformal inference using a normalized surrogate error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on various case studies.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Unknown Dynamical Systems via Gaussian Process Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging autonomous systems in safety-critical scenarios requires verifying their behaviors in the presence of uncertainties and black-box components that influence the system dynamics. In this work, we develop a framework for verifying discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled dynamics and noisy measurements against temporal logic specifications from an input-output dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstracts the continuous-space system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification results on the abstraction created from noisy measurements to the underlying system. We show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis illustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Contingency-constrained economic dispatch with safe reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future power systems will rely heavily on micro grids with a high share of decentralised renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. The high complexity and uncertainty in this context might make conventional power dispatch strategies infeasible. Reinforcement-learning based (RL) controllers can address this challenge, however, cannot themselves provide safety guarantees, preventing their deployment in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a formally validated RL controller for economic dispatch. We extend conventional constraints by a time-dependent constraint encoding the islanding contingency. The contingency constraint is computed using set-based backwards reachability analysis and actions of the RL agent are verified through a safety layer. Unsafe actions are projected into the safe action space while leveraging constrained zonotope set representations for computational efficiency. The developed approach is demonstrated on a residential use case using real-world measurements.</description>

      <title>Recursive Dynamic State Estimation for Power Systems with an Incomplete Nonlinear DAE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems are highly complex, large-scale engineering systems subject to many uncertainties, which makes accurate mathematical modeling challenging. This paper proposes a novel, centralized dynamic state estimator for power systems that lack models of some components. Including the available dynamic evolution equations, algebraic network equations, and phasor measurements, we apply the least squares criterion to estimate all dynamic and algebraic states recursively. The approach results in an algorithm that generalizes the iterated extended Kalman filter and does not require static network observability. We further derive a graph theoretic condition for placing phasor measurement units that guarantees the uniqueness of the solution. A numerical study evaluates the performance under short circuits in the network and load changes and shows superior tracking performance compared to robust procedures from the literature within computational times that are feasible for real-time application.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we determine a fundamental anatomical modeling parallelism between low-inertia power systems and Bohr's atomic model. The proposed atomic architecture will serve as a microscopic building block, where we validate the structural analogy of low-inertia power systems using semi-classical quantum approximations in IEEE 9-bus &amp; 39-bus systems. As a future scope of work, detailed modeling &amp; system stability will be investigated by using pre-quantization and geometric quantization methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Optimal PMU Placement Problem in Multi-Machine Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To provide real-time visibility of physics-based states, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are deployed throughout power networks. PMU data enable real-time grid monitoring and control -- and are essential in transitioning to smarter grids. Various considerations are taken into account when determining the geographic, optimal PMU placements (OPP). This paper focuses on the control-theoretic, observability aspect of OPP. A myriad of studies have investigated observability-based formulations to determine the OPP within a transmission network. However, they have mostly adopted a simplified representation of system dynamics, ignored basic algebraic equations that model power flows, disregarded including renewables such as solar and wind, and did not model their uncertainty. Consequently, this paper revisits the observability-based OPP problem by addressing the literature's limitations. A nonlinear differential algebraic representation (NDAE) of the power system is considered. The system is discretized using various discretization approaches while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. A moving horizon estimation approach is explored to reconstruct the joint differential and algebraic initial states of the system, as a gateway to the OPP problem which is then formulated as a computationally tractable integer program (IP). Comprehensive numerical simulations on standard power networks are conducted to validate the different aspects of this approach and test its robustness to various dynamical conditions</description>

Abstract: Reasonable vibration reduction design is an important way to achieve low phase noise index of airborne frequency source output signal. Aiming at the problem of phase noise deterioration of an airborne frequency source under random condition, this paper proposes to improve the vibration reduction mode crystal oscillator and reduce the distance between the barycenter of frequency source and crystal oscillator vibration based on the analysis of the relationship between the frequency source and the phase noise of output signal. Experimental results show that the active noise control system achieves 62dB phase noise compensation under the random vibration of 0.04-0.1g*g/Hz amplitude range and 5-2000 Hz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics, Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this technical note, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of nonlinear systems (computed via perturbing initial conditions) yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the technical note's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.</description>

      <title>Empowering Safe Reinforcement Learning for Power System Control with CommonPower</title>

Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). However, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure satisfaction of system constraints. Therefore, combining them with formally correct safeguarding mechanisms is an important aspect when studying RL for power system management. Integrating safeguarding into complex use cases requires tool support. To address this need, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower. CommonPower's unique contribution lies in its symbolic modeling approach, which enables flexible, model-based safeguarding of RL controllers. Moreover, CommonPower offers a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, with seamless integration of different forecasting methods. This allows users to validate the effectiveness of safe RL controllers across a large variety of case studies and investigate the influence of specific aspects on overall performance. We demonstrate CommonPower's versatility through a numerical case study that compares RL agents featuring different safeguards with a model predictive controller in the context of building energy management.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Learning of MIMO Signal Detection over Grassmannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain or statistical distribution shifts are a key staple of the wireless communication channel, because of the dynamics of the environment. Deep learning (DL) models for detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals in dynamic communication require large training samples (in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions) and online retraining to adapt to domain shift. Some dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples or online fine-tuning which incurs significant end-to-end delay. In this paper, a novel classification technique based on the concept of geodesic flow kernel (GFK) is proposed for MIMO signal detection. In particular, received MIMO signals are first represented as points on Grassmannian manifolds by formulating basis of subspaces spanned by the rows vectors of the received signal. Then, the domain shift is modeled using a geodesic flow kernel integrating the subspaces that lie on the geodesic to characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties of the received signals. The kernel derives low-dimensional representations of the received signals over the Grassman manifolds that are invariant to domain shift and is used in a geometric support vector machine (G-SVM) algorithm for MIMO signal detection in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the existing baselines like OAMPnet and MMNet with only 1,200 training samples and without online retraining.</description>

We build a theoretical framework that helps us to analyze extremely difficult problems which include both nonlinearity and noise of semiconductors. Using our proposed framework, we analytically calculate the amplitude noise and phase noise of nonlinear RC circuits in the presence of nonlinear capacitance and conductance. As a more practical example, we analyze the amplitude noise and phase noise of a common-emitter stage bipolar transistor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots (WBRs) have the capability to execute agile and versatile locomotion tasks. This paper focuses on improving the dynamic performance of WBRs through innovations in both hardware and software development. Inspired by the human barbell squat, a bionic mechanical design is proposed and implemented as shown in Fig. 1. It distributes the weight onto its hip and knee joints to improve the effectiveness of joint motors while maintaining a relatively large workspace of the base link. Meanwhile, a novel model-based controller is devised, synthesizing height-variable wheeled linear inverted pendulum (HV-wLIP) model, Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and whole-body dynamics for theoretically guaranteed stability and efficient computation. Compared with other alternatives, as a more accurate approximation of the WBR dynamics, the HV-wLIP can enable more agile response and provide theory basis for WBR controller design. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot could perform human-like deep squat, and is capable of maintaining tracking CoM velocity while manipulating base states. Furthermore, it exhibited robustness against external disturbances and unknown terrains even in the wild.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>
