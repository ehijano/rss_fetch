      <title>Stochastic bifurcation in economic growth model driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enhances the classical Solow model of economic growth by integrating L\'evy noise, a type of non-Gaussian stochastic perturbation, to capture the inherent uncertainties in economic systems. The extended model examines the impact of these random fluctuations on capital stock and output, revealing the role of jump-diffusion processes in long-term GDP fluctuations. Both continuous and discrete-time frameworks are analyzed to assess the implications for forecasting economic growth and understanding business cycles. The study compares deterministic and stochastic scenarios, providing insight into the stability of equilibrium points and the dynamics of economies subjected to random disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate how stochastic noise contributes to economic volatility, leading to abrupt shifts and bifurcations in growth trajectories. This research offers a comprehensive perspective on the influence of external shocks, presenting a more realistic depiction of economic development in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Payrolls to Prompts: Firm-Level Evidence on the Substitution of Labor for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to transform how firms produce output. Yet, credible evidence on how AI is actually substituting for human labor remains limited. In this paper, we study firm-level substitution between contracted online labor and generative AI using payments data from a large U.S. expense management platform. We track quarterly spending from Q3 2021 to Q3 2025 on online labor marketplaces (such as Upwork and Fiverr) and leading AI model providers. To identify causal effects, we exploit the October 2022 release of ChatGPT as a common adoption shock and estimate a difference-in-differences model. We provide a novel measure of exposure based on the share of spending at online labor marketplaces prior to the shock. Firms with greater exposure to online labor adopt AI earlier and more intensively following the shock, while simultaneously reducing spending on contracted labor. By Q3 2025, firms in the highest exposure quartile increase their share of spending on AI model providers by 0.8 percentage points relative to the lowest exposure quartile, alongside significant declines in labor marketplace spending. Combining these responses yields a direct estimate of substitution: among the most exposed firms, a \$1 decline in online labor spending is associated with approximately \$0.03 of additional AI spending, implying order-of-magnitude cost savings from replacing outsourced tasks with AI services. These effects are heterogeneous across firms and emerge gradually over time. Taken together, our results provide the first direct, micro-level evidence that generative AI is being used as a partial substitute for human labor in production.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Behavioral Parameters with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral parameters such as loss aversion, herding, and extrapolation are central to asset pricing models but remain difficult to measure reliably. We develop a framework that treats large language models (LLMs) as calibrated measurement instruments for behavioral parameters. Using four models and 24{,}000 agent--scenario pairs, we document systematic rationality bias in baseline LLM behavior, including attenuated loss aversion, weak herding, and near-zero disposition effects relative to human benchmarks. Profile-based calibration induces large, stable, and theoretically coherent shifts in several parameters, with calibrated loss aversion, herding, extrapolation, and anchoring reaching or exceeding benchmark magnitudes. To assess external validity, we embed calibrated parameters in an agent-based asset pricing model, where calibrated extrapolation generates short-horizon momentum and long-horizon reversal patterns consistent with empirical evidence. Our results establish measurement ranges, calibration functions, and explicit boundaries for eight canonical behavioral biases.</description>

      <title>Hype Has Worth: Attention, Sentiment, and NFT Valuation in Major Ethereum Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do online narratives leave a measurable imprint on prices in markets for digital or cultural goods? This paper evaluates how community attention and sentiment relate to valuation in major Ethereum NFT collections after accounting for time effects, market-wide conditions, and persistent visual heterogeneity. Transaction data for large generative collections are merged with Reddit-based discourse measures available for 25 collections, covering 87{,}696 secondary-market sales from January 2021 through March 2025. Visual differences are absorbed by a transparent, within-collection standardized index built from explicit image traits and aggregated via PCA. Discourse is summarized at the collection-by-bin level using discussion intensity and lexicon-based tone measures, with smoothing to reduce noise when text volume is sparse. A mixed-effects specification with a Mundlak within--between decomposition separates persistent cross-collection differences from within-collection fluctuations. Valuations align most strongly with sustained collection-level attention and sentiment environments; within collections, short-horizon negativity is consistently associated with higher prices, and attention is most informative when measured as cumulative engagement over multiple prior windows.</description>

      <title>The Strategic Foresight of LLMs: Evidence from a Fully Prospective Venture Tournament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can artificial intelligence outperform humans at strategic foresight -- the capacity to form accurate judgments about uncertain, high-stakes outcomes before they unfold? We address this question through a fully prospective prediction tournament using live Kickstarter crowdfunding projects. Thirty U.S.-based technology ventures, launched after the training cutoffs of all models studied, were evaluated while fundraising remained in progress and outcomes were unknown. A diverse suite of frontier and open-weight large language models (LLMs) completed 870 pairwise comparisons, producing complete rankings of predicted fundraising success. We benchmarked these forecasts against 346 experienced managers recruited via Prolific and three MBA-trained investors working under monitored conditions. The results are striking: human evaluators achieved rank correlations with actual outcomes between 0.04 and 0.45, while several frontier LLMs exceeded 0.60, with the best (Gemini 2.5 Pro) reaching 0.74 -- correctly ordering nearly four of every five venture pairs. These differences persist across multiple performance metrics and robustness checks. Neither wisdom-of-the-crowd ensembles nor human-AI hybrid teams outperformed the best standalone model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Solar Investment and Operation under Asymmetric Net Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the joint investment and operational decisions of a prosumer, a customer who both consumes and generates electricity, under net energy metering (NEM) tariffs. Traditional NEM schemes provide temporally flat compensation at the retail price for net energy exports over a billing period. However, ongoing reforms in several U.S. states are introducing time-varying prices and asymmetric import/export compensation to better align incentives with grid costs. While prior studies treat PV capacity as exogenous and focus primarily on consumption behavior, this work endogenizes PV investment and derives the marginal value of solar capacity for a flexible prosumer under asymmetric NEM tariffs. We characterize optimal investment and show how optimal investment changes with prices and PV costs. Through this analysis, we identify a PV effect: changes in NEM pricing in one period can influence net demand and consumption in generating periods with unchanged prices through adjustments in optimal PV investment. The PV effect weakens the ability of higher import prices to increase prosumer payments, with direct implications for NEM reform. We validate our theoretical results in a case study using simulated household and tariff data derived from historical conditions in Massachusetts.</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions in Science and Technology Networks: Substitutes or Complements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of scientific and technological peer effects to study how individuals' productivity responds to the behavior and network positions of their collaborators across both scientific and inventive activities. Building on a simultaneous equation network framework, the model predicts that productivity in each activity increases in a variation of the Katz-Bonacich centrality that captures within-activity and cross-activity strategic complementarities. To test these predictions, we assemble the universe of cancer-related publications and patents and construct coauthorship and coinventorship networks that jointly map the collaboration structure of researchers active in both spheres. Using an instrumental-variables approach based on predicted link formation from exogenous dyadic characteristics, and incorporating community fixed effects to address endogenous network formation, we show that both authors' and inventors' outputs rise with their network centrality, consistent with the theory. Moreover, scientific productivity significantly enhances technological productivity, while technological output does not exert a detectable reciprocal effect on scientific production, highlighting an asymmetric linkage aligned with a science-driven model of innovation. These findings provide the first empirical evidence on the joint dynamics of scientific and inventive peer effects, underscore the micro-foundations of the co-evolution of science and technology, and reveal how collaboration structures can be leveraged to design policies that enhance collective knowledge creation and downstream innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how labor market conditions around high school graduation affect postsecondary skill investments. Using administrative data on more than six million German graduates from 1995-2018, and exploiting deviations from secular state-specific trends, I document procyclical college enrollment. Cyclical increases in unemployment reduce enrollment at traditional universities and shift graduates toward vocational colleges and apprenticeships. These effects translate into educational attainment. Using large-scale survey data, I identify changes in expected returns to different degrees as the main mechanism. During recessions, graduates expect lower returns to an academic degree, while expected returns to a vocational degree are stable.</description>

      <title>AI in Debt Collection: Estimating the Psychological Impact on Consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the psychological and behavioral implications of integrating AI into debt collection practices using data from eleven European countries. Drawing on a large-scale experimental design (n = 3514) comparing human versus AI-mediated communication, we examine effects on consumers' social preferences (fairness, trust, reciprocity, efficiency) and social emotions (stigma, empathy). Participants perceive human interactions as more fair and more likely to elicit reciprocity, while AI-mediated communication is viewed as more efficient; no differences emerge in trust. Human contact elicits greater empathy, but also stronger feelings of stigma. Exploratory analyses reveal notable variation between gender, age groups, and cultural contexts. In general, the findings suggest that AI-mediated communication can improve efficiency and reduce stigma without diminishing trust, but should be used carefully in situations that require high empathy or increased sensitivity to fairness. The study advances our understanding of how AI influences the psychological dynamics in sensitive financial interactions and informs the design of communication strategies that balance technological effectiveness with interpersonal awareness.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Migration to Europe: ICO Reallocation Following U.S. Securities Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines whether a major U.S. regulatory clarification coincided with cross-border spillovers in crypto-asset entrepreneurial finance. We study the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 2017 DAO Report, which clarified the application of U.S. securities law to many initial coin offerings, and analyze how global issuance activity adjusted across regions. Using a comprehensive global dataset of ICOs from 2014 to 2021, we construct a region-month panel and evaluate issuance dynamics around the announcement. We document a substantial and persistent reallocation of ICO activity toward Europe following the DAO Report. In panel regressions with region and month fixed effects, Europe experiences an average post-2017 increase of approximately 14 additional ICOs per region-month relative to other regions, net of global market cycles. The results are consistent with cross-border regulatory spillovers in highly mobile digital-asset markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of our AI governance efforts focus on substance: what rules do we want in place? What limits or checks do we want to impose on AI development and deployment? But a key role for law is not only to establish substantive rules but also to establish legal and regulatory infrastructure to generate and implement rules. The transformative nature of AI calls especially for attention to building legal and regulatory frameworks. In this PNAS Perspective piece I review three examples I have proposed: the creation of registration regimes for frontier models; the creation of registration and identification regimes for autonomous agents; and the design of regulatory markets to facilitate a role for private companies to innovate and deliver AI regulatory services.</description>

      <title>Sector-Specific Substitution and the Effect of Sectoral Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How a shock to an individual sector propagates to the prices of other sectors and aggregates to GDP depends on how easily sectoral goods can be substituted in production, which is determined by the intermediate input substitution elasticity. Past estimates of this parameter in the US have been restrictive: they have assumed a common elasticity across industries, and have ignored the use of imports in production. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to produce new estimates without these restrictions, by exploiting variation in import ratios and input expenditure shares from the BEA Input-Output Accounts. I find that sectors differ meaningfully in their ability to substitute inputs in production, and that the uniform estimate of the intermediate input substitution elasticity is biased downwards relative to the median sector-specific estimate. Relative to imposing the uniform elasticity, sector-specific substitution causes domestic prices to rise more in response to oil import shocks and less in response to semiconductor import shocks. It also implies the average GDP response to a sectoral business cycle is 0.35% higher, making sectoral business cycles 17.7% less costly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study staged entry with costly gatekeeping in a differentiated-products economy: entrepreneurs observe noisy signals before paying a resource-intensive activation cost. Precision improves selection but requires more resources, reducing entry and variety: welfare need not rise with precision. Under CES preferences, the activation cutoff is efficient as profit displacement offsets the consumer-surplus gain from variety. Welfare losses arise from verification costs shrinking the feasible set of varieties, not from misaligned incentives. Because the market responds efficiently to any given regime, these losses cannot be corrected via Pigouvian taxes.</description>

      <title>Comrades and Cause: Peer Influence on West Point Cadets' Civil War Allegiances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do social networks and peer influence shape major life decisions in highly polarized settings? We explore this question by examining how peers influenced the allegiances of West Point cadets during the American Civil War. Leveraging quasi-random variations in the proportion of cadets from Free States, we analyze how these differences affected cadets' decisions about which army to join. We have three main findings. First, there was a strong and significant peer effect: a higher proportion of classmates from Free States significantly increased the likelihood that cadets from Slave States joined the Union Army. Second, the peer effect varies with geography, most notably with the slave population share in cadets' home states or counties, and with cadets' own slave ownership in 1860. Third, shared experiences -- such as having served together in the Mexican-American War, continuous military service, and belonging to the same cohort -- amplified peer effects, suggesting that sustained interaction is important.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from international club football in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play a crucial role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments. Their importance has been substantially increased from the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule. Our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, we do not detect any (positive) relationship between relative team strength and shootout success using differences in Elo ratings. Consequently, penalty shootouts seem to be close to a coin toss in top European club football.</description>

Abstract: We introduce heterogeneous R&amp;D productivities into an endogenous R&amp;D network formation model, generalizing the framework of Goyal and Moraga-Gonz\'alez (2001). Heterogeneous productivities endogenously create asymmetric gains from collaboration: less productive firms benefit disproportionately from links, while more productive firms exert greater R&amp;D effort and incur higher costs. When productivity gaps are sufficiently large, more productive firms experience lower profits from collaborating with less productive partners. As a result, the complete network -- stable under homogeneity -- becomes unstable, and the positive assortative (PA) network, in which firms cluster by R&amp;D productivity, emerges as pairwise stable. Using simulations, we show that the clustered structure delivers higher welfare than the complete network; nevertheless, welfare under this formation follows an inverted U-shape as the fraction of high-productivity firms increases, reflecting crowding-out effects at high fractions. Altogether, we uncover an R&amp;D productivity puzzle: economies with higher average R&amp;D productivity may exhibit lower welfare through (i) the formation of alternative stable networks, or (ii) a crowding-out effect of high-productivity firms. Our findings show that productivity gaps shape the organization of innovation by altering equilibrium R&amp;D alliances and effort. Productivity-enhancing policies must therefore account for these endogenous responses, as they may reverse intended welfare gains.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Bilevel subsidy-enabled mobility hub network design with perturbed utility coalitional choice-based assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10465</link>

Abstract: Urban mobility is undergoing rapid transformation with the emergence of new services. Mobility hubs (MHs) have been proposed as physical-digital convergence points, offering a range of public and private mobility options in close proximity. By supporting Mobility-as-a-Service, these hubs can serve as focal points where travel decisions intersect with operator strategies. We develop a bilevel MH platform design model that treats MHs as control levers. The upper level (platform) maximizes revenue or flow by setting subsidies to incentivize last-mile operators; the lower level captures joint traveler-operator decisions with a link-based Perturbed Utility Route Choice (PURC) assignment, yielding a strictly convex quadratic program. We reformulate the bilevel problem to a single-level program via the KKT conditions of the lower level and solve it with a gap-penalty method and an iterative warm-start scheme that exploits the computationally cheap lower-level problem. Numerical experiments on a toy network and a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) case (244 nodes, 469 links, 78 ODs) show that the method attains sub-1% optimality gaps in minutes. In the base LIRR case, the model allows policymakers to quantify the social surplus value of a MH, or the value of enabling subsidy or regulating the microtransit operator's pricing. Comparing link-based subsidies to hub-based subsidies, the latter is computationally more expensive but offers an easier mechanism for comparison and control.</description>
