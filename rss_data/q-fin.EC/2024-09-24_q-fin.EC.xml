      <title>Determinants of Workplace Flextime Flexibility: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the factors that determine workplace autonomy in the choice of schedules, using GEIH data for formal employees from January 2023 to February 2024. A logistic regression model identified significant relationships between autonomy and variables such as company size, income, tenure, workplace, and job satisfaction. The results highlight the complexity of these factors and suggest the need for improvements in the predictive model.</description>

      <title>Friends, Key Players and the Adoption and Use of Experience Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper empirically investigates how an individual's network influences their purchase and subsequent use of experience goods. Utilising data on the network and game-ownership of over 108 million users from the world's largest video game platform, we analyse whether a user's friendship network influences their decision to purchase single-player video games. Our identification strategy uses an instrumental variable (IV) approach that employs the temporal lag of purchasing decisions from second degree friends. We find strong peer effects in the individual game adoption in the contemporary week. The effect is stronger if the friend who purchased the game is an old friend compared to a key player in the friendship network. Comparing the results to adoption decisions for a major label game, we find peer effects of a similar size and duration. However, the time subsequently spent playing the games is higher for players who were neither influenced by a peer who is a key player nor an old friend. Considering the increasing importance of online networks on consumption decisions, our findings offer some first insights on the heterogeneity of peer effects between old and key player friends and also provide evidence in consumers' biases in social learning.</description>

      <title>The role of gender in promotion rates in the Australian Finance Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We surveyed Australian finance professionals and tested whether there are statistically significant differences in promotional propensity according to gender identity. The findings indicate men and women are equally likely to ask for promotion, however, 'gifted advancements' account for the higher statistical frequency of promotions among men. These gender-based differences in behaviors have been overlooked in existing research on promotion. We call for a standardized framework for the development of promotion policies to address this industry-wide problem.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Three-Child Policy and Delayed Retirement on the Transfer of Surplus Rural Labor under Xi Jinping's New Population Vision: A Re-examination of China's Lewis Turning Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese-style modernization involves the modernization of a large population, requiring top-level design in terms of scale and structure. The population perspective in Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era serves as the fundamental guide for population policies. The three-child policy and delayed retirement will affect the supply of labor in China and challenge the previous assessments of China's Lewis Turning Point. This study examines the rural surplus labor transfer from 2013 to 2022 based on urban and rural data. The results indicate that China's overall wage levels have continuously increased, the urban-rural income gap has narrowed, and the transfer of surplus rural labor has slowed. China has passed the first turning point and entered a transitional phase. Factors such as the level of agricultural mechanization, urbanization rate, and urban-rural income gap are more significant in influencing the transfer of surplus labor than the normal working-age population ratio. The delayed retirement policy has a more immediate impact on the supply and transfer of rural surplus labor than the three-child policy. Additionally, delayed retirement can offset the negative impact of the reduced relative surplus labor supply caused by the three-child policy, although the three-child policy could increase the future absolute surplus labor supply.</description>

      <title>Temperature Variability and Natural Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies natural disasters and the psychological costs of climate change. It presents what we believe to be the first evidence that higher temperature variability and not a higher level of temperature is what predicts natural disasters. This conclusion holds whether or not we control for the (incorrectly signed) impact of temperature. The analysis draws upon long-differences regression equations using GDIS data from 1960-2018 for 176 countries and the contiguous states of the USA. Results are checked on FEMA data. Wellbeing impact losses are calculated. To our knowledge, the paper's results are unknown to natural and social scientists.</description>

      <title>A Dataset of Uniswap daily transaction indices by network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is reshaping traditional finance by enabling direct transactions without intermediaries, creating a rich source of open financial data. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are emerging to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem, surpassing Layer 1 (L1) systems. However, the impact of L2 solutions is still underexplored, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive transaction data indices for economic analysis. This study bridges that gap by analyzing over 50 million transactions from Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange, across both L1 and L2 networks. We created a set of daily indices from blockchain data on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, offering insights into DeFi adoption, scalability, decentralization, and wealth distribution. Additionally, we developed an open-source Python framework for calculating decentralization indices, making this dataset highly useful for advanced machine learning research. Our work provides valuable resources for data scientists and contributes to the growth of the intelligent Web3 ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>
