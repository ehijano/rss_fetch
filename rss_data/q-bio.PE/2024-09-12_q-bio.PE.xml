      <title>Why aphids are not pests in cacao? An approach based on a predator-prey model with aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied a mean-field predator-prey model with aging to simulate the \mbox{interaction} between aphids (\textit{Toxoptera aurantii}) and syrphid larvae in \mbox{cacao} farms in Ilheus, Bahia. Based on the classical predator-prey model, we \mbox{propose} a system of differential equations with three rate equations. \mbox{Unlike} the original Lotka-Volterra model, our model includes two aphid population classes: juveniles (non-breeding) and adult females (asexually breeding). We obtained steady-state solutions for juvenile and adult populations by \mbox{analyzing} the stability of the fixed points as a function of model \mbox{parameters}. The results show that the absorbing state (zero prey population) is always possible, but not consistently stable. A nonzero stationary solution is achievable with appropriate parameter values. Using phase diagrams, we analyzed the \mbox{stationary} solution, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics involved. Simulations on complete graphs yielded results closely matching the differential equations. We also performed simulations on random networks to highlight the influence of network topology on system behavior.</description>

      <title>On the design and stability of cancer adaptive therapy cycles: deterministic and stochastic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive therapy is a promising paradigm for treating cancers, that exploits competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, thereby avoiding or delaying treatment failure due to evolution of drug resistance within the tumor. Previous studies have shown the mathematical possibility of building cyclic schemes of drug administration which restore tumor composition to its exact initial value in deterministic models. However, algorithms for cycle design, the conditions on which such algorithms are certain to work, as well as conditions for cycle stability remain elusive. Here, we state biologically motivated hypotheses that guarantee existence of such cycles in two deterministic classes of mathematical models already considered in the literature: Lotka-Volterra and adjusted replicator dynamics. We stress that not only existence of cyclic schemes, but also stability of such cycles is a relevant feature for applications in real clinical scenarios. We also analyze stochastic versions of the above deterministic models, a necessary step if we want to take into account that real tumors are composed by a finite population of cells subject to randomness, a relevant feature in the context of low tumor burden. We argue that the stability of the deterministic cycles is also relevant for the stochastic version of the models. In fact, Dua, Ma and Newton [Cancers (2021)] and Park and Newton [Phys. Rev. E (2023)] observed breakdown of deterministic cycles in a stochastic model (Moran process) for a tumor. Our findings indicate that the breakdown phenomenon is not due to stochasticity itself, but to the deterministic instability inherent in the cycles of the referenced papers. We then illustrate how stable deterministic cycles avoid for very large times the breakdown of cyclic treatments in stochastic tumor models.</description>

      <title>Spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by cost-free drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial populations often have complex spatial structures, which can impact their evolution. Here, we study how spatial structure affects the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a bacterial population. We consider a minimal model of spatially structured populations where all demes (i.e., subpopulations) are identical and connected to each other by identical migration rates. We show that spatial structure can facilitate the survival of a bacterial population to antibiotic treatment, starting from a sensitive inoculum. Indeed, the bacterial population can be rescued if antibiotic resistant mutants appear and are present when drug is added, and spatial structure can impact the fate of these mutants and the probability that they are present. Specifically, if the mutation that provides resistance is neutral or effectively neutral, its probability of fixation is increased in smaller populations. This promotes local fixation of resistant mutants in the structured population, which facilitates evolutionary rescue by cost-free drug resistance. Once the population is rescued by resistance, migrations allow resistant mutants to spread in all demes. Our main results extend to the case where there are resistant mutants in the inoculum, and to more complex spatial structures. They also extend to resistant mutants that carry a fitness cost, although the timescales involved are longer.</description>

      <title>Fixation probability in Moran-like Processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Isothermal Theorem was introduced in a Nature Communications article in 2005 and has since contributed to the creation of the rich field of evolutionary graph theory. The theorem states under which conditions certain Moran-like processes on graphs ("spatial Moran Processes") have the same fixation probability as the classic one-dimensional Moran Process that was introduced by Moran in 1958. Unfortunately, the Isothermal Theorem has never been proven completely. The main argument, that the projection of the process on the graph dynamics onto a one-dimensional process is a Birth-and-Death-Process, is not true in general, as the projection does not need to be Markovian. The aim of this paper is to present a more general version of the Isothermal Theorem using martingale techniques and a generalised framework using matrix notation. We follow up with a short study of small population size that shows the set of spatial Moran Processes with Moran fixation probability is even richer than previously understood. We underline the role played by the initial condition, and how individuals of the population are chosen for procreation.</description>
