      <title>Normalized solutions and stability for biharmonic Schr\"odinger equation with potential on waveguide manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following biharmonic Schr\"odinger equation with potential and mixed nonlinearities \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\Delta^2 u +V(x,y)u+\lambda u =\mu|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{q-2}u,\ (x, y) \in \Omega_r \times \mathbb{T}^n, \\ \int_{\Omega_r\times\mathbb{T}^n}u^2dxdy=\Theta,\end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega_r \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is an open bounded convex domain, $r&gt;0$ is large and $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. The exponents satisfy $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{8}{d+n}&lt;q&lt;4^*=\frac{2(d+n)}{d+n-4}$, so that the nonlinearity is a combination of a mass subcritical and a mass supercritical term. Under some assumptions on $V(x,y)$ and $\mu$, we obtain the several existence results on waveguide manifold. Moreover, we also consider the orbital stability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the fractional dissipative system in the framework of variable Fourier--Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the well-posed issues of the fractional dissipative system in the framework of the Fourier--Besov spaces with variable regularity and integrability indices. By fully using some basic properties of these variable function spaces, we establish the linear estimates in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the fractional heat equation. Such estimates are fundamental for solving certain dissipative PDE's of fractional type. As an applications, we prove global well-posedness in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the 3D generalized incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and the 3D fractional Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev Spaces and an Eigenvalue Problem for an Elliptic Equation with $ L^1 $ Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the continuity and compactness of the operators $W^{1, q}(\Omega ; \mathtt {V}_0, \mathtt {V}_1 ) \rightarrow L^{q_0} (\Omega ; \mathtt {V}_2)$ and $W^{1, q} (\Omega ; \mathtt {V}_0, \mathtt {V}_1 ) \rightarrow L^{q_1}(\partial \Omega ; \mathtt {W})$ in weighted Sobolev spaces. To study additional properties of these Sobolev spaces, we will also study the equation: $$ \left\{\begin{aligned} -\operatorname{div}\left(\mathtt {V}_1 \nabla u\right)+\mathtt {V}_0 u &amp; =\lambda \mathtt {V}_2 \tau u+\mathtt {V}_2 f_0 &amp; &amp; \text { in } \Omega, \\ \mathtt {V}_1 \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} &amp; =\mathtt {W}_1 f_1 &amp; &amp; \text { on } \partial \Omega, \end{aligned}\right. $$ where $\Omega$ is an open subset of a Riemannian manifold, $\lambda$ is a real number, $f_0 \in L^1 (\Omega ; \mathtt {V}_0), f_1 \in L^1(\partial \Omega ; \mathtt {W})$, $\tau$ is a function that changes sign, and $\mathtt {V}_i, \mathtt {W}, \mathtt {W}_1$ are weight functions satisfying suitable conditions. We aim to obtain existence results similar to those for the case where the data are given in $L^2 (\Omega ; \mathtt {V}_0)$ and $L^2(\partial \Omega ; \mathtt {W})$. For the case where $f_0=0$ and $f_1=0$, we are also interested in studying the limit ess $\sup _{\Omega \backslash \Omega_m}|u| \rightarrow 0$, where $\Omega_m$ is a sequence of open sets such that $\Omega_m \subset \Omega_{m+1}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scalar field equation with point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear scalar field equation with a point interaction at the origin in dimensions two and three. By applying the mountain pass theorem and the technique of adding one dimensional space, we prove the existence of a nontrivial singular solution for a wide class of nonlinearities. We also establish the Pohozaev identity by proving a pointwise estimate of the gradient near the origin. Some qualitative properties of nontrivial solutions are also given.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Sobolev norms for Kolmogorov operators with scaling-critical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for time-dependent nonlinear transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate inverse problems of recovering the time-dependent coefficient in the nonlinear transport equation in both cases: two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. Specifically, it is shown that its initial boundary value problem is well-posed for small initial and incoming data. Moreover, the time-dependent coefficient appearing in the nonlinear term can be uniquely determined from boundary measurements as well as initial and final data. To achieve this, the central techniques we utilize include the linearization technique and the construction of special geometrical optics solutions for the linear transport equation. This allows us to reduce the inverse coefficient problem to the inversion of certain weighted light ray transforms. Based on the developed methodology, the inverse source problem for the nonlinear transport equation in the scattering-free media is also studied.</description>

      <title>Attractors for weak and strong solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the existence of global attractors for the dynamical systems generated by weak solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping. We consider two cases, depending on the values of the parameters \b{eta},{\alpha} controlling the damping term and the viscosity {\mu}. First, for \b{eta} we define a multivalued dynamical systems and prove the existence of the global attractor as well. Second, for either \b{eta}&gt;3 or \b{eta}=3, 4{\alpha}{\mu}&gt;1 the weak solutions are unique and we prove that the global attractor for the corresponding semigroup is more regular. Also, we prove in this case that it is the global attractor for the semigroup generated by the strong solutions. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic approaches in inverse problems for depolymerization estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depolymerization reactions constitute frequent experiments, for instance in biochemistry for the study of amyloid fibrils. The quantities experimentally observed are related to the time dynamics of a quantity averaged over all polymer sizes, such as the total polymerised mass or the mean size of particles. The question analysed here is to link this measurement to the initial size distribution. To do so, we first derive, from the initial reaction system $$\mathcal{C}_i \stackrel{b}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{C}_{i-1} + \mathcal{C}_1,\qquad i\geq i_0\geq 2,$$ two asymptotic models: at first order, a backward transport equation, and at second order, an advection-diffusion/Fokker-Planck equation complemented with a mixed boundary condition at $x = 0$. We estimate their distance to the original system solution. We then turn to the inverse problem, i.e., how to estimate the initial size distribution from the time measurement of an average quantity, given by a moment of the solution. This question has been already studied for the first order asymptotic model, and we analyse here the second order asymptotic. Thanks to Carleman inequalities and to log-convexity estimates, we prove observability results and error estimates for a Tikhonov regularization. We then develop a Kalman-based observer approach, and implement it on simulated observations. Despite its severely ill-posed character, the second-order approach appears numerically more accurate than the first-order one.</description>

      <title>On (discounted) global Eikonal equations in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eikonal equations in metric spaces have strong connections with the local slope operator (or the De Giorgi slope). In this manuscript, we explore and delve into an analogous model based on the global slope operator, expressed as $\lambda u + G[u] = \ell$, where $\lambda \geq 0$. In strong contrast with the classical theory, the global slope operator relies neither on the local properties of the functions nor on the structure of the space, and therefore new insights are developed in order to analyze the above equation. Under mild assumptions on the metric space $X$ and the given data $\ell$, we primarily discuss: $(a)$ the existence and uniqueness of (pointwise) solutions; $(b)$ a viscosity perspective and the employment of Perron's method to consider the maximal solution; $(c)$ stability of the maximal solution with respect to both, the data $\ell$ and the discount factor $\lambda$. Our techniques provide a method to approximate solutions of Eikonal equations in metric spaces and a new integration formula based on the global slope of the given function.</description>

      <title>Existence of distributional solutions to degenerate elliptic systems for locally integrable forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an existence result and maximal regularity estimates for distributional solutions to degenerate/singular elliptic systems of $p$-Laplacian type with absorption and (prescribed) locally integrable forcing posed in unbounded Lipschitz domains. In particular, the forcing terms may not belong to the dual space of an energy space, e.g., $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}$, which is necessary for the existence of weak (or energy) solutions of class $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}$. The method of a proof relies on both local energy estimates and a relative truncation technique developed by Bul\'{i}\v{c}ek and Schwarzacher (Calc. Var. PDEs in 2016), where the bounded domain case is studied for (globally) integrable forcing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a Hamilton-Jacobi equation admits a differentiable solution whose gradient is Lipschitz, then this solution is the unique semi-concave weak solution. Our result does not rely on any convexity (nor concavity) assumptions on the initial condition or the nonlinearity, and can therefore be utilized in contexts where the viscosity solution admits no standard variational representation.</description>

      <title>Radial blow-up standing solutions for the semilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear wave equation with a power nonlinearity in the radial case. Given $r_0&gt;0$, we construct a blow-up solution such that the solution near $(r_0,T(r_0))$ converges exponentially to a soliton. Moreover, we show that $r_0$ is a non-characteristic point. For that, we translate the question in self-similar variables and use a modulation technique. We will also use energy estimates from the one dimensional case treated by Merle and Zaag. Of course because of the radial setting, we have an additional gradient term which is delicate to handle. That's precisely the purpose of our paper.</description>

We prove that these $3d+3$ unknown scalar coefficients can be H\"older stably retrieved by $(3d+2)$-times suitably changing the initial condition attached at the system.</description>

      <title>Excess decay for quasilinear equations in the Heisenberg group and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity results for the solutions of quasilinear subelliptic $p$-Laplace type equation in Heisenberg groups. We prove somewhat surprising excess decay estimates for the constant coefficient homogeneous equation. Excess decay estimates, while well known in the Euclidean case, due to the celebrated works of Uraltseva and Uhlenbeck, was not known in the setting of Heisenberg groups until now and this lack of excess decay estimate is often attributed to the noncommutativity of the horizontal vector fields. Our results show that, in spite of the this noncommutative feature, excess decay estimates analogous to the Euclidean case hold.
  To illustrate the potency of our excess decay estimates, we prove two results. First is a H\"{o}lder continuity result that extends the presently known results to the full range $1&lt; p &lt; \infty.$ The second is a sharp borderline continuity result for the horizontal gradient of the solution. More precisely, we show that if $u \in HW_{\text{loc}}^{1,p}$ satisfies $$\operatorname{div}_{\mathbb{H}} \left( a(x) \lvert \mathfrak X u \rvert^{p-2} \mathfrak X u \right) \in L^{(Q,1)}_{\text{loc}}$$ in a domain of $\mathbb{H}_{n},$ where $\mathbb{H}_{n}$ is the Heisenberg group with homogeneous dimension $Q=2n+2,$ for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty, $ with uniformly positive, bounded, Dini continuous scalar function $a$, then $\mathfrak X u$ is continuous. This generalizes the classical result by Stein and the work of Kuusi-Mingione for linear and quasilinear equations, respectively, in the Euclidean case and Folland-Stein for the linear case in the Heisenberg group setting. This result is new even when either $a$ is constant or when the equation is homogeneous.</description>

      <title>A strong-form stability for a class of $L^p$ Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg interpolation inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a class of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (CKN) interpolation inequality and establish a strong-form stability as following: \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{v\in\mathcal{M}_{p,a,b}}\frac{ \|u-v\|_{H_b^p} \|u-v\|_{L^p_a}^{p-1} }{\|u\|_{H^p_b}\|u\|_{L^p_a}^{p-1}} \le C\delta_{p,a,b}(u)^{t}, \end{equation*} where $t=1$ for $p=2$ and $t=\frac{1}{p}$ for $p &gt; 2$, and $\delta_{p,a,b}(u)$ is deficit of the CKN. We also note that it is impossible to establish stability results for $\|\cdot\|_{H_b^p}$ or $\|\cdot\|_{L_a^p}$ separately. Moreover, we consider the second-order CKN inequalities and establish similar results for radial functions.</description>

      <title>On the conservation of helicity by weak solutions of the 3D Euler and inviscid MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of an ideal incompressible fluid conserve the helicity. We introduce a new weak formulation of the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations in which (by implementing the Bony paradifferential calculus) the advection terms are interpreted as paraproducts for weak solutions with low regularity. Using this approach we establish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous foundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity. We provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker than many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the literature.
  Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be conserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, under additional assumptions we establish a relation between the defect measure (which is part of the local helicity balance) and a third-order structure function for solutions of the Euler equations. As a byproduct of the approach introduced in this paper, we also obtain a new sufficient condition for the conservation of magnetic helicity in the inviscid MHD equations, as well as for the kinematic dynamo model.
  Finally, it is known that classical solutions of the ideal (inviscid) MHD equations which have divergence-free initial data will remain divergence-free, but this need not hold for weak solutions. We show that weak solutions of the ideal MHD equations arising as weak-$*$ limits of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the viscous and resistive MHD equations remain divergence-free in time.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity and Hopf lemma for nondegenerate stable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp boundary H{\"o}lder regularity for solutions to equations involving stable integro-differential operators in bounded open sets satisfying the exterior $C^{1,\text{dini}}$-property. This result is new even for the fractional Laplacian. A Hopf-type boundary lemma is proven, too. An additional feature of this work is that the regularity estimate is robust as $s\to 1-$ and we recover the classical results for second order equations.</description>

      <title>Growth of Sobolev norms for completely resonant quantum harmonic oscillators on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time dependently perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $$ {\rm i} \partial_t u=\frac12(-\partial_{x_1}^2-\partial_{x_2}^2 + x_1^2+x_2^2)u +V(t, x, D)u, \qquad \ x \in \mathbb{R}^2, $$ where $V(t, x, D)$ is a selfadjoint pseudodifferential operator of degree zero, $2\pi$ periodic in time. We identify sufficient conditions on the principal symbol of the potential $V(t, x, D)$ that ensure existence of solutions exhibiting unbounded growth in time of their positive Sobolev norms and we show that the class of symbols satisfying such conditions is generic in the Fr\'echet space of classical $2\pi$- time periodic symbols of order zero. To prove our result we apply the abstract Theorem of arXiv:2101.09055v1 : the main difficulty is to find a conjugate operator $A$ for the resonant average of $V(t,x, D)$. We construct explicitly the symbol of the conjugate operator $A$, called escape function, combining techniques from microlocal analysis, dynamical systems and contact topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established existence and multiplicity of solution for the following class of quasilinear elliptic problems
  $$
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta_\Phi u = \lambda a(x) |u|^{q-2}u + |u|^{p-2}u, &amp; x\in\Omega,
  u = 0, &amp; x \in \partial \Omega,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  $$
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N, N \geq 2,$ is a smooth bounded domain, $1 &lt; q &lt; \ell \leq m &lt; p &lt; \ell^*$ and $\Phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is suitable $N$-function. The main feature here is to show whether the Nehari method can be applied to find the largest positive number $\lambda^* &gt; 0$ in such way that our main problem admits at least two distinct solutions for each $\lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$. Furthermore, using some fine estimates and some extra assumptions on $\Phi$, we prove the existence of at least two positive solutions for $\lambda = \lambda^*$ and $\lambda \in (\lambda^*, \overline{\lambda})$ where $\overline{\lambda} &gt; \lambda^*$.</description>

      <title>Low-regularity global solution of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of low regularity Cauchy data for nonlinear dispersive PDEs has successfully been achieved using modulation spaces $M^{p,q}$ in recent years. In this paper, we study the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (INLS) $$iu_t + \Delta u\pm |x|^{-b}|u|^{\alpha}u=0,$$
  where $\alpha, b&gt;0,$ on whole space $\mathbb R^n$ in modulation spaces. In the subcritical regime $(0&lt;\alpha&lt; \frac{4-2b}{n}),$ we establish local well-posedness in $L^{2}+M^{\alpha+2,\frac{\alpha+2}{\alpha+1}}( \supset L^2 + H^s \ \text{for} \ s&gt;\frac{n\alpha}{2(\alpha+2)}).$ By adapting Bourgain's high-low decomposition method, we establish global well-posedness in $M^{p,\frac{p}{p-1}}$ with $2&lt;p$ and $p$ sufficiently close to 2. This is the first global well-posedness result for INLS on modulation spaces, which contains certain Sobolev $H^s$ $(0&lt;s&lt;1)$ and $L^p_s-$Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a well-posedness theory for conservative stochastic partial differential equations on the whole space. This class of stochastic PDEs arises in fluctuating hydrodynamics, and includes the Dean--Kawasaki equation with correlated noise. In combination with the analysis of the authors and Heydecker [35], the connection between fluctuating hydrodynamics and macroscopic fluctuation theory in the context of the zero range particle process is made rigorous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>PDE-Systems associated with the hypergeometric functions in three variables and their particular solutions near the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The great success of the theory of hypergeometric series in one variable has stimulated the development of a corresponding theory in two and more variables. Horn has investigated the convergence of 34 (14 complete and 20 confluent) hypergeometric series of two variables and established the systems of partial differential equations which they satisfy. At present, 600 (of which 205 are complete and 395 are confluent) hypergeometric functions of three second-order variables are known. The present work is devoted to the composition of systems of partial differential equations satisfied by 600 confluent hypergeometric functions of three variables. In addition, a particular solutions (if such solutions exist) of some systems of differential equations have been found near the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the hot spots conjecture for a class of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are a natural generalization of the lip domains of Atar and Burdzy [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 17 (2004), 243-265] in dimension two, as well as for a class of symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generalizing the domains studied by Jerison and Nadirashvili [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 13 (2000), 741-772]. Our method of proof is based on studying a vector-valued Laplace operator whose spectrum contains the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian. This proof is essentially variational and does not require tools from stochastic analysis, nor does it use deformation arguments. In particular, it contains a new proof of the main result of Jerison and Nadirashvili.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the two main symmetries for the one-dimensional generalised KPZ equation (gKPZ): the chain rule and the It\^o Isometry. We consider the equation in the full-subcritical regimes and use multi-indices that avoid an over-parametrization of the renormalised equation to compute the dimension of the two spaces associated with these two symmetries. Our proof is quite elementary and shows that multi-indices provide in this case a simplification in comparison to the results obtained via decorated trees. It also completes the program on the study of the chain rule initiated in arxiv:1902.02884 and continued in arxiv:2403.17066.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main object of the paper is a recently discovered family of multicomponent integrable systems of partial differential equations, whose particular cases include many well-known equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries, coupled KdV, Harry Dym, coupled Harry Dym, Camassa--Holm, multicomponent Camassa--Holm, Dullin--Gottwald--Holm, and Kaup--Boussinesq equations.
  We suggest a methodology for constructing a series of solutions for all systems in the family. The crux of the approach lies in reducing this system to a dispersionless integrable system which is a special case of linearly degenerate quasilinear systems actively explored since the 1990s and recently studied in the framework of Nijenhuis geometry. These infinite-dimensional integrable systems are closely connected to certain explicit finite-dimensional integrable systems. We provide a link between solutions of our multicomponent PDE systems and solutions of this finite-dimensional system, and use it to construct animations of multi-component analogous of soliton and cnoidal solutions.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a model of nonlinear magnetoelasticity where magnetization is defined in the Eulerian configuration while elastic deformation is in the Lagrangean one, we rigorously derive a linearized model that coincides with the standard one that already appeared in the literature, see, e.g., DeSimone \&amp; James (2002) and where the zero-stress strain is quadratic in the magnetization.
  The relation of the nonlinear and linear model is stated in terms of the $\Gamma$-convergence and convergence of minimizers.</description>

Abstract: Assuming as hypotheses the results proved numerically by Chang et al. \cite{Chang} for the exponent $p\in (3,5)$, we prove that some of the ground states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with pure power nonlinearity of exponent $p$ in the line are asymptotically stable for a certain set of values of the exponent $p$ where the FGR occurs by means of a discrete mode 3rd or 4th order power interaction with the continuous mode. For the 3rd the result is true for generic $p$ while for the 4th order case we assume that there are $p$'s satisfying Fermi Golden rule and the non-resonance condition of the threshold of the continuous spectrum of the linearization. The argument is similar to our recent result valid for $p$ near 3 contained in \cite{CM24D1}.</description>

      <title>Decoding a mean field game by the Cauchy data around its unknown stationary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, mean field games (MFGs) have garnered considerable attention and emerged as a dynamic and actively researched field across various domains, including economics, social sciences, finance, and transportation. The inverse design and decoding of MFGs offer valuable means to extract information from observed data and gain insights into the intricate underlying dynamics and strategies of these complex physical systems. This paper presents a novel approach to the study of inverse problems in MFGs by analyzing the Cauchy data around their unknown stationary states. This study distinguishes itself from existing inverse problem investigations in three key significant aspects: Firstly, we consider MFG problems in a highly general form. Secondly, we address the technical challenge of the probability measure constraint by utilizing Cauchy data in our inverse problem study. Thirdly, we enhance existing high order linearization methods by introducing a novel approach that involves conducting linearization around non-trivial stationary states of the MFG system, which are not a-priori known. These contributions provide new insights and offer promising avenues for studying inverse problems for MFGs. By unraveling the hidden structure of MFGs, researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions, optimize system performance, and address real-world challenges more effectively.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resolvent Estimates for Subwavelength Resonators: The Minnaert Bubble Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonators are small scaled objects that exhibit contrasting medium properties (eigher in intensity or sign) while compared to the ones of a uniform background. Such contrasts allow them to resonate at specific frequencies. There are two ways to mathematically define these resonances. First, as the frequencies for which the related system of integral equations is not injective. Second, as the frequencies for which the related resolvent operator of the natural Hamiltonian, given by the wave-operator, has a pole.
  In this work, we consider, as the subwavelength resonator, the Minneart bubble. We show that these two mentioned definitions are equivalent. Most importantly,
  1. we derive the related resolvent estimates which are uniform in terms of the size/contrast of the resonators. As a by product, we show that the resolvent operators have no resonances in the upper half complex plane while they exhibit two resonances in the lower half plane which converge to the real axis, as the size of the bubble tends to zero. As these resonances are poles of the natural Hamiltonian, given by the wave-operator, and have the Minnaert frequency as their dominating real part, this justifies calling them Minnaert resonances.
  2. we derive the asymptotic estimates of the generated scattered fields which are uniform in terms of the incident frequency and which are valid everywhere in space (i.e. inside or outside the bubble).
  The dominating parts, for both the resolvent operator and the scattered fields, are given by the ones of the point-scatterer supported at the location of the bubble. In particular, these dominant parts are non trivial (not the same as those of the background medium) if and only if the used incident frequency identifies with the Minnaert one.</description>

Abstract: We present a minimization problem with a horizontal divergence-type constraint in the Heisenberg group. Our study explores its dual formulation and examines its relationship with the congested optimal transport problem, for $1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty$, as well as the Monge-Kantorovich problem, in the limite case $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger (INLS) equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ \begin{align}\label{inls} i \partial_t u +\Delta u +V(x)|u|^{\frac{4-2b}{N}}u = 0, \end{align} where $V(x) = k(x)|x|^{-b}$, with $b&gt;0$. Under suitable assumptions on $k(x)$, we established the threshold for global existence and blow-up and then study the existence and non-existence of minimal mass blow-up solutions.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation in the homogeneous critical regularity framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a unique global solution to the Cauchy problem of the 3D Boltzmann equation for initial data around the Maxwellian in the spatially critical homogeneous Besov space $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{1/2}\cap\dot{B}_{2,1}^{3/2})$. In addition, under the condition that the low-frequency part of initial perturbation is bounded in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{\sigma_{0}})$ with $-3/2\leq\sigma_{0}&lt;1/2$, it is shown that the solution converges to its equilibrium in large times with the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2})$ in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\sigma})$ with some $\sigma&gt;\sigma_0$, and the microscopic part decays at an enhanced rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2-1/2})$. In contrast to [19], the usual $L^2$ estimates are not necessary in our approach, which provides a new understanding of hypocoercivity theory for the Boltzmann equation allowing to construct the Lyapunov functional with different dissipation rates at low and high frequencies. Furthermore, a time-weighted Lyapunov energy argument can be developed to deduce the optimal time-decay estimates.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with applications in numerical approximations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1307.3021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an introduction to boundary value problems for Dirac-type operators on complete Riemannian manifolds with compact boundary. We introduce a very general class of boundary conditions which contains local elliptic boundary conditions in the sense of Lopatinskij and Shapiro as well as the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions. We discuss boundary regularity of solutions and also spectral and index theory. The emphasis is on providing the reader with a working knowledge.</description>

      <title>An optimal boundary control problem related to the time dependent Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a boundary control problem for the evolutionary Navier-Stokes equations, under mixed boundary conditions, in two dimensions. The cost functional here considered is of quadratic type, depending on both state and control variables. We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to address the analysis and the derivation of a system of first-order optimality conditions that characterizes the solution of the control problem. We take advantage of an adequate treatment of the Dirichlet control through the study of the reduced functional. Despite the fact that this approach is quite common, a detailed analysis for the case of mixed boundary conditions with is still lacking. Finally, solution-finding algorithms of descent type are proposed and illustrated with several simulations.</description>
