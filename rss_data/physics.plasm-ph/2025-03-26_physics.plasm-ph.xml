      <title>Convective Nature of the Stimulated Raman Side Scattering in Inertial Confinement Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute growth of Stimulated Raman side scattering (SRSS) predicted by previous theories appeared to be surprisingly absent in the recent ignition-scale direct-drive experiments with the absence attributed to different reasons. We present evidence from simulations that the linear SRSS modes are naturally all convective (i.e., absolute SRSS does not exist at all) in an experimentally relevant regime where a finite-beam-width laser is incident into a non-uniform low-density plasma below a quarter of the critical density. The convective gain demonstrated by our newly proposed formula via numerical fitting monotonically increases with the beam width without saturation, which is significantly different from the prediction of previous convective SRSS theories.</description>

      <title>EFIT-mini: An Embedded, Multi-task Neural Network-driven Equilibrium Inversion Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium reconstruction, which infers internal magnetic fields, plasmas current, and pressure distributions in tokamaks using diagnostic and coil current data, is crucial for controlled magnetic confinement nuclear fusion research. However, traditional numerical methods often fall short of real-time control needs due to time-consuming computations or iteration convergence issues. This paper introduces EFIT-mini, a novel algorithm blending machine learning with numerical simulation. It employs a multi-task neural network to replace complex steps in numerical equilibrium inversion, such as magnetic surface boundary identification, combining the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their individual drawbacks. The neural network processes coil currents and magnetic measurements to directly output plasmas parameters, including polynomial coefficients for $p'$ and $ff'$, providing high-precision initial values for subsequent Picard iterations. Compared to existing AI-driven methods, EFIT-mini incorporates more physical priors (e.g., least squares constraints) to enhance inversion accuracy. Validated on EXL-50U tokamak discharge data, EFIT-mini achieves over 98% overlap in the last closed flux surface area with traditional methods. Besides, EFIT-mini's neural network and full algorithm compute single time slices in just 0.11ms and 0.36ms at 129$\times$129 resolution, respectively, representing a three-order-of-magnitude speedup. This innovative approach leverages machine learning's speed and numerical algorithms' explainability, offering a robust solution for real-time plasmas shape control and potential extension to kinetic equilibrium reconstruction. Its efficiency and versatility position EFIT-mini as a promising tool for tokamak real-time monitoring and control, as well as for providing key inputs to other real-time inversion algorithms.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Test of the "Canis" HTS Planar Coil Array for Stellarator Field Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. is currently developing the "Eos" planar coil stellarator, the Company's first integrated fusion system capable of forming optimized stellarator magnetic fields without complex and costly modular coils. To demonstrate the field shaping capability required to enable Eos, Thea Energy designed, constructed, and tested the "Canis" 3x3 array of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) planar shaping coils after successfully demonstrating a single shaping coil prototype. Through the Canis 3x3 magnet array program, Thea Energy manufactured nine HTS shaping coils and developed the cryogenic test and measurement infrastructure necessary to validate the array's performance. Thea Energy operated the array at 20 K, generating several stellarator-relevant magnetic field shapes and demonstrating closed loop field control of the superconducting magnets to within 1% of predicted field, a margin of error acceptable for operation of an integrated stellarator. The Canis magnet array test campaign provides a proof of concept for HTS planar shaping coils as a viable approach to confining stellarator plasmas.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the final saturated magnetic field strength exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing or energy equipartition with the turbulence, scaling as $B \propto \rho^{5/6}$, where $\rho$ is the cloud density. Apart from establishing a formal framework for the studies of magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings have significant implications for early star and galaxy formation, suggesting that magnetic fields can be amplified to dynamically relevant strengths much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Velocity modulations in view of the elliptical approach at Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of the poloidal velocity of the turbulence and the poloidal mean flow velocity are important quantities for the study of sheared flows on turbulence and transport. The estimation depends on the underlying model of the turbulence. Beside the propagation time of the turbulence, its decay with the fading time must be considered. For the description of the propagation, the elliptical approach is applied, which takes into account the propagation and fading time of the turbulence. The model has been applied successfully in experimental fluid dynamics and is confirmed by direct numerical simulations, also.
  In this paper, the elliptical approach is applied in the analysis of density fluctuations, measured by poloidal correlation reflectometry at two different fusion devices, TEXTOR and W7-X. For the latter, it is demonstrated that the elliptical approach is necessary for a correct description of the turbulence propagation. In addition, the velocity modulations are investigated, which in principle can be either generated by an oscillation of the propagation time of density fluctuations and/or an oscillation of the fading of the turbulence. An example for low frequency velocity oscillations in W7-X will be given in the paper, showing a relation between turbulence properties and small oscillations on the measured diamagnetic plasma energy.</description>

      <title>Helmet streamer influence on the evolution of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Solar eruptions are crucial for space weather studies. Understanding the mechanisms influencing their evolution is key to improving predictions of their geoeffectiveness. Helmet streamers (HSs) are persistent structures in the solar corona, present in both minimum and maximum solar activity periods. These structures contain a current sheet of low magnetic energy, where coronal mass ejections (CMEs) tend to deflect. However, they also feature a closed magnetic field region beneath this sheet, often confining eruptions. Their complexity makes predicting eruptions challenging. Aims: This study examines how HSs influence the evolution and potential confinement of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). We explore magnetic configurations where the MFR is more likely to rise through the overlying field, aiming to establish simple parameters that help predict whether an MFR will ascend or remain confined. Methods: Using 2.5D MHD simulations, we model MFR dynamics in the presence of an HS, analyzing different magnetic configurations and focusing on the mechanisms that enable ascent or confinement. Results: Null-point reconnection plays a key role in MFR dynamics. Depending on the initial configuration, it can either disrupt the MFR, preventing ascent, or reduce the strapping flux, facilitating upward motion. We identify a critical threshold: if the strapping flux above the MFR is less than two-thirds of its poloidal flux, the MFR ascends successfully. Conclusions: Our simulations show that null-point reconnection significantly impacts MFR ascent. A key predictor of successful rise is the initial ratio of the MFR's poloidal flux to the strapping flux above it.</description>

      <title>Axial-radial plasma transport and performance of a plasma thruster magnetic nozzle under Bohm's anomalous diffusion scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic nozzles (MN) are known to be subject to anomalous non-collisional diffusion mechanisms driven by instabilities and wave-particle interactions. This study therefore employs a fully kinetic axial-radial particle-in-cell (PIC) model to examine the impact of this anomalous diffusion on plasma transport and the propulsive performance of MNs typical of low-power cathode-less radio-frequency (RF) plasma thrusters. A Bohm-type anomalous collisionality scaling ($\nu_{an}=\alpha_{an}\omega_{ce}$) is implemented to simulations of the 150 W-class REGULUS-150-Xe thruster, evaluating both low-power (30 W) and high-power (150 W) operating conditions. The impact on azimuthal electron current formation is assessed, as well as its subsequent effect on thrust generation, momentum and power balance, and overall propulsive efficiency. A critical value of the Bohm coefficient was found to exist, where the MN expansion transitions from a well-collimated to an under-collimated state and electron transport shifts from being dominated by magnetic advection to being dominated by cross-field diffusion. This critical transition was found to occur within a narrow interval between $\alpha_{an}$=1/128 and 1/64. Beyond this threshold, it is found that the enhanced cross-field transport of electrons inhibits the formation of the typical MN potential barrier, reducing the radial confinement. The downstream potential drop is reduced by up to 15\%. Diamagnetic electron current is diminished in the absence of steep pressure gradients and the $E\times B$ current becomes purely paramagnetic. The MN efficiency is cut from circa 0.5 to 0.2 due to loss of electron thermal energy conversion and increased plume divergence. At the Bohm limit of $\alpha_{an}=1/16$, agreement to experimental thrust profiles of $&lt;20\%$ is achieved in contrast to 48\% overestimation at high-power in the classical case.</description>
