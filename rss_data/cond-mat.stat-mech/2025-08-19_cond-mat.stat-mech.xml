      <title>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the Active Model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Strong overlap of deterministic and stochastic dynamics in a super-diffusive regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider deterministic dynamics, known as the slicer map (SM), which exhibits normal and anomalous diffusion by varying a single parameter. The statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process called the L\'evy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships. Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Molecular Simulation and Process Modeling for Predictive Multicomponent Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</description>

      <title>A multiple occupancy cell fluid model with competing attraction and repulsion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytically solvable cell fluid model with unrestricted cell occupancy, infinite-range Curie-Weiss-type attraction and short-range intra-cell repulsion is studied within the grand-canonical ensemble. Building on an exact single-integral representation of the grand partition function, we apply Laplace's method to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the pressure, density and equation of state. The model exhibits a hierarchy of first-order transitions, each terminating at a critical point. We determine the coordinates of the first five such points. Recasting the formalism in dimensionless variables highlights the explicit temperature dependence of all thermodynamic functions. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the entropy. The results reveal pronounced entropy minima around integer cell occupancies and reproduce density-anomaly isotherm crossings analogous to those in core-softened models.</description>

      <title>Extraction of classical ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis develops exact analytical tools to study strongly correlated stochastic systems, with a focus on extreme value statistics, gap statistics, and full counting statistics in multi-particle processes. A central contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range correlations while retaining analytical tractability.
  Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights, ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically tractable non-equilibrium steady states.
  Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored, identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional resetting.</description>

      <title>Precision and cost of feedback cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for realistic parameter values.</description>

      <title>Inertia Tames Fluctuations in Autonomous Stationary Heat Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.</description>

      <title>Intermediate time scale in the first product formation time distribution of Michaelis-Menten kinetics with inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one of the most recognized models in enzyme kinetics, crucial for the understanding of biochemical reactions in several metabolic processes. In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schr\"odinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</description>

      <title>Steering chiral active Brownian motion via stochastic position-orientation resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can thus transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice fermion model with antiferromagnetic interactions on the three-dimensional cubic lattice. The hopping term of the Hamiltonian has a Weyl-type dispersion.

      <title>Controlling quantum scars and engineering subharmonic responses with a two frequency drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and time crystal-like behavior.</description>

      <title>A collisional model of odd fluids: from Boltzmann equation to chiral hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the time-reversal and parity symmetries in a fluid are broken, transverse transport coefficients can arise in response to perturbations, an example being odd viscosity. We refer to these systems as odd fluids. While much progress has been made in the continuum theory of odd-viscous fluids, and non-collisional models for odd viscous fluids have been proposed, a classical microscopic description in which the transverse responses originate from collisions is lacking. In this paper, we show that a dilute granular gas of rough and inelastic particles driven by a constant torque is a minimal microscopic model of an odd fluid. By applying the methods of Boltzmann kinetic theory, we obtain a hydrodynamic description of the microscopic model. Then, using the method of adiabatic elimination, we numerically compute all the response coefficients of the model, explicitly showing that the model has many odd response terms. Our theory predicts that certain odd response coefficients can change sign even when the direction of the external torque is fixed. While we choose a particular case, the procedure we present can be applied to any collisional model. We also present a semi-quantitative method to determine the hydrodynamic variables of the theory by observing the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear collision operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is an ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part of a bottom-up approach to gravitational thermodynamics that is guided by the axiomatic frameworks of equilibrium thermodynamics. We identify a novel form of the microcanonical distribution for systems in background gravitational fields that respects the kinetic theory and the thermodynamic symmetries. Thermodynamic consistency dictates the treatment of the gravitational field as a thermodynamic variable. We introduce the thermodynamic conjugate to the gravitational field, the gravitational pull, an additive variable that is a structural element of our microcanonical distribution. We demonstrate the validity of our results to inhomogenous background fields, a class of self-gravitating systems, relativistic gases in Rindler spacetime, and quantum gases.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system formed by $M$ particles moving in 3 dimension and interacting with 2 heat reservoirs with $N&gt;&gt;M$ particles each. The system and the reservoirs evolve and interact via random collision described by a Kac-type master equation. The initial state of the reservoirs is given by 2 Maxwellian distributions at temperature $T_+$ and $T_-$. We show that, for times much shorter than $\sqrt{N}$ the interaction with the reservoirs is well approximated by the interaction with 2 Maxwellian thermostats, that is, heat reservoirs with $N=\infty$. As a byproduct, if $T_+=T_-$ we extend the results in \cite{BLTV} to particles in 3 dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the drag force exerted by a suspension of light-induced active particles (APs) on a translating and beating idealized flagellum-shaped object realized through negative phototactic interactions with the APs. We observe both positive and negative drag forces, depending on the beating frequency and translational velocity, driven by the dynamic redistribution of APs in response to the object's motion. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and an analytical model, extendable to a range of slender geometries. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between geometric body changes and the density distribution in active baths, which may also be relevant for microrobotic applications.</description>

Abstract: We study a quantum interacting spin system subject to an external drive and coupled to a thermal bath of spatially localized vibrational modes, serving as a model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization. We show that even when the many-body eigenstates of the system are ergodic, a sufficiently strong coupling to the bath may effectively localize the spins due to many-body quantum Zeno effect, as manifested by the hole-burning shape of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. Our results provide an explanation of the breakdown of the thermal mixing regime experimentally observed above 4 - 5 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>The geometric phase transition of the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After fifty years of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the nature of the transition between their topological phases (confinement/deconfinement) remains challenging due to the absence of a local order parameter. In this work, we conduct a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model using intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, offering fresh insights into the topological phase transitions of gauge-invariant systems. We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$, with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at $T_{\rm c}$, enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition. This work sheds new light on the critical behavior of pure LGTs, with potential implications for condensed matter systems and quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Energy Calculations Using Formal Proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches for validating molecular simulations rely on making software open source and transparent, incorporating unit testing, and generally employing human oversight. We propose an approach that eliminates software errors using formal logic, providing proofs of correctness. We use the Lean theorem prover and programming language to create a rigorous, mathematically verified framework for computing molecular interaction energies. We demonstrate this in LeanLJ, a package of functions, proofs, and code execution software that implements Lennard Jones energy calculations in periodic boundaries. We introduce a strategy that uses polymorphic functions and typeclasses to bridge formal proofs (about idealized Real numbers) and executable programs (over floating point numbers). Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics. This approach can be extended to formally verified molecular simulations, in particular, and formally verified scientific computing software, in general. Keywords: Formal verification, Lean 4, molecular simulations, functional programming.</description>

      <title>Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a half-line $x \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) with distribution $Q(u_j)$, located at $x=0$. By computing the first two moments, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exclusion process with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the headway exclusion process which is an exclusion process with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with jump rates that depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump but not on $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ unidirectionally it is proved by reverse duality that a certain family of non-stationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and a stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Entanglement in Lifshitz Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Observing the dynamics of octupolar structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional (3D), unit-cell-like ion clusters. We identify a set of transitions signaled by parity-odd octupole order parameters, and probe their distinct dynamical signatures. Our observations reveal the softening of a collective Higgs-like mode indicating spontaneous symmetry-breaking, hysteresis resulting from a catastrophe where a metastable state vanishes abruptly, and stochastic switching between metastable states of differing symmetries. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence of symmetry-breaking and discontinuous transitions, analogous to a thermodynamic triple point. Our results establish 3D trapped-ion clusters as a versatile platform to engineer complex potential energy landscapes, opening new avenues for studies of reaction kinetics, geometric frustration, and related phenomena in mesoscopic platforms.</description>

      <title>When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of a logarithmic partition function to investigate quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of a partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>

Abstract: Building on a work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The upper bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>
