      <title>Polygon Containment and Translational Min-Hausdorff-Distance between Segment Sets are 3SUM-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3SUM problem represents a class of problems conjectured to require $\Omega (n^2)$ time to solve, where $n$ is the size of the input. Given two polygons $P$ and $Q$ in the plane, we show that some variants of the decision problem, whether there exists a transformation of $P$ that makes it contained in $Q$, are 3SUM-Hard. In the first variant $P$ and $Q$ are any simple polygons and the allowed transformations are translations only; in the second and third variants both polygons are convex and we allow either rotations only or any rigid motion. We also show that finding the translation in the plane that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between two segment sets is 3SUM-Hard.</description>

      <title>Solving the Heilbronn Triangle Problem using Global Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Heilbronn triangle problem, which involves placing n points in the unit square such that the minimum area of any triangle formed by these points is maximized. A straightforward maximin formulation of this problem is highly non-linear and non-convex due to the existence of bilinear terms and absolute value equations. We propose two mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) and one QCP formulation, which can be readily solved by any global optimization solver. We develop several formulation enhancements in the form of bound tightening and symmetry breaking inequalities that are prevalent in the global optimization literature in addition to other enhancements that exploit the problem structure. With the help of these enhancements, our models reproduce proven optimal values for instances up to n = 8 points with certified optimality in the order of seconds. In the case of n = 9 points, for which no analytical proof is known, we establish a certified optimal value by a computational effort of one day. This is a significant improvement over the previous benchmark established in 31 days of computations by Chen et al. (2017).</description>

      <title>HGS: Hybrid Gaussian Splatting with Static-Dynamic Decomposition for Compact Dynamic View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Area-Sensitive Bounds for Polytope Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating convex bodies is a fundamental problem in geometry. Given a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for a fixed dimension $d$, the objective is to minimize the number of facets of an approximating polytope for a given Hausdorff error $\varepsilon$. The best known uniform bound, due to Dudley (1974), shows that $O((\text{diam}(K)/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets suffice. Although this bound is optimal for fat objects, such as Euclidean balls, it is far from optimal for ``skinny'' convex bodies.
  Skinniness can be characterized relative to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body $K$, define its area radius, $\text{arad}(K)$, to be the radius of the Euclidean ball having the same surface area as $K$. It follows from generalizations of the isoperimetric inequality that $\text{diam}(K) \geq 2 \cdot \text{arad}(K)$.
  We show that, given a convex body whose minimum width is at least $\varepsilon$, it is possible to approximate the body by a polytope having $O((\text{arad}(K)/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets. Our approach works by first reducing the problem of approximating convex bodies to that of approximating convex functions. We employ a classical concept from convexity, called Macbeath regions. We demonstrate that there is a polar relationship between the Macbeath regions of a function and the Macbeath regions of its Legendre dual. This is combined with known bounds on the Mahler volume to bound the total size of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms fundamentally group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. \noindent This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are utilized to capture object movement history based on the average Euclidean distance between line segments.
  In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify local similarity patterns. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. To address this, we introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We evaluate all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>
