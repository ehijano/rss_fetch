      <title>Bayesian Model Parameter Learning in Linear Inverse Problems with Application in EEG Focal Source Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems can be described as limited-data problems in which the signal of interest cannot be observed directly. A physics-based forward model that relates the signal with the observations is typically needed. Unfortunately, unknown model parameters and imperfect forward models can undermine the signal recovery. Even though supervised machine learning offers promising avenues to improve the robustness of the solutions, we have to rely on model-based learning when there is no access to ground truth for the training. Here, we studied a linear inverse problem that included an unknown non-linear model parameter and utilized a Bayesian model-based learning approach that allowed signal recovery and subsequently estimation of the model parameter. This approach, called Bayesian Approximation Error approach, employed a simplified model of the physics of the problem augmented with an approximation error term that compensated for the simplification. An error subspace was spanned with the help of the eigenvectors of the approximation error covariance matrix which allowed, alongside the primary signal, simultaneous estimation of the induced error. The estimated error and signal were then used to determine the unknown model parameter. For the model parameter estimation, we tested different approaches: a conditional Gaussian regression, an iterative (model-based) optimization, and a Gaussian process that was modeled with the help of physics-informed learning. In addition, alternating optimization was used as a reference method. As an example application, we focused on the problem of reconstructing brain activity from EEG recordings under the condition that the electrical conductivity of the patient's skull was unknown in the model. Our results demonstrated clear improvements in EEG source localization accuracy and provided feasible estimates for the unknown model parameter, skull conductivity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multiple Testing with False Discovery Rate Control in the Presence of Byzantines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies distributed multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control in the presence of Byzantine attacks, where an adversary captures a fraction of the nodes and corrupts their reported p-values. We focus on two baseline attack models: an oracle model with the full knowledge of which hypotheses are true nulls, and a practical attack model that leverages the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure locally to classify which p-values follow the true null hypotheses. We provide a thorough characterization of how both attack models affect the global FDR, which in turn motivates counter-attack strategies and stronger attack models. Our extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical results, highlight key design trade-offs under attacks and countermeasures, and provide insights into more sophisticated attacks.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Fluid RIS-aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (fRIS)-aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is proposed to enhance multi-target sensing and multi-user communication. Unlike the conventional RIS, the fRIS incorporates movable elements whose positions can be flexibly adjusted to provide extra spatial degrees of freedom. In this system, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize sensing beampattern mismatch and communication symbol estimation error by optimizing the symbol estimator, transmit beamformer, fRIS phase shifts, and element positions. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on alternating minimization is devised, where subproblems are solved leveraging augmented Lagrangian method, quadratic programming, semidefinite-relaxation, and majorization-minimization techniques. A key challenge exists that the fRIS element positions affect both the incident and reflective channels, leading to the high-order composite functions regarding the positions. As a remedy, it is proved that the high-order terms can be transformed to linear and linear-difference forms using the characteristics of fRIS and structural channels, which facilitates the position optimization. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared to the conventional RIS-aided ISAC systems and other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ROMA: ROtary and Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotary and movable antenna (ROMA) architecture represents a next-generation multi-antenna technology that enables flexible adjustment of antenna position and array rotation angles of the transceiver. In this letter, we propose a ROMA-aided multi-user MIMO communication system to fully enhance the efficiency and reliability of system transmissions. By deploying ROMA panels at both the transmitter and receiver sides, and jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles of each ROMA panel and the relative positions of antenna elements based on the spatial distribution of users and channel state information (CSI), we can achieve the objective of maximizing the average spectral efficiency (SE). Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of the average SE performance of the system under the consideration of maximum ratio (MR) precoding. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem in the ROMA multi-user MIMO system, we propose an efficient solution based on an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the AO-based ROMA architecture can significantly improve the average SE. Furthermore, the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the size of the movable region and the transmission power increase.</description>

      <title>Deep Multi-modal Neural Receiver for 6G Vehicular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) based neural receiver models are used to jointly optimize PHY of baseline receiver for cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X) system in next generation (6G) communication, however, there has been no exploration of how varying training parameters affect the model's efficiency. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on multi-modal data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a neural receiver designed to optimize Bit Error Rate (BER) for vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario in 6G network. We train multiple neural receivers by changing its trainable parameters and use the best fit model as proposition for large scale deployment. Our proposed neural receiver gets signal in frequency domain at the base station (BS) as input and generates optimal log likelihood ratio (LLR) at the output. It estimates the channel based on the received signal, equalizes and demodulates the higher order modulated signal. Later, to evaluate multi-modality of the proposed model, we test it across diverse V2X data flows (e.g., image, video, gps, lidar cloud points and radar detection signal). Results from simulation clearly indicates that our proposed multi-modal neural receiver outperforms state-of-the-art receiver architectures by achieving high performance at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Radio Map Estimation via Latent Domain Plug-and-Play Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME), also known as spectrum cartography, aims to reconstruct the strength of radio interference across different domains (e.g., space and frequency) from sparsely sampled measurements. To tackle this typical inverse problem, state-of-the-art RME methods rely on handcrafted or data-driven structural information of radio maps. However, the former often struggles to model complex radio frequency (RF) environments and the latter requires excessive training -- making it hard to quickly adapt to in situ sensing tasks. This work presents a spatio-spectral RME approach based on plug-and-play (PnP) denoising, a technique from computational imaging. The idea is to leverage the observation that the denoising operations of signals like natural images and radio maps are similar -- despite the nontrivial differences of the signals themselves. Hence, sophisticated denoisers designed for or learned from natural images can be directly employed to assist RME, avoiding using radio map data for training. Unlike conventional PnP methods that operate directly in the data domain, the proposed method exploits the underlying physical structure of radio maps and proposes an ADMM algorithm that denoises in a latent domain. This design significantly improves computational efficiency and enhances noise robustness. Theoretical aspects, e.g., recoverability of the complete radio map and convergence of the ADMM algorithm are analyzed. Synthetic and real data experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Integrated 6G TN and NTN Localization: Challenges, Opportunities, and Advancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cellular networks has introduced groundbreaking technologies, including large and distributed antenna arrays and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in terrestrial networks (TNs), as well as aerial and space-based nodes in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). These advancements enable applications beyond traditional communication, such as high-precision localization and sensing. While integrating TN and NTN enablers will lead to unparalleled opportunities for seamless global localization, such integration attempts are expected to face several challenges. To understand these opportunities and challenges, we first examine the distinctive characteristics of the key 6G enablers, evaluating their roles in localization from both technical and practical perspectives. Next, to identify developments driving TN-NTN localization, we review the latest standardization and industrial innovation progress. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of TN-NTN integration, illustrating its potential through two numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Interference Prediction Using Gaussian Process Regression and Management Framework for Critical Services in Local 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference prediction and resource allocation are critical challenges in mission-critical applications where stringent latency and reliability constraints must be met. This paper proposes a novel Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based framework for predictive interference management and resource allocation in future 6G networks. Firstly, the received interference power is modeled as a Gaussian process, enabling both the prediction of future interference values and their corresponding estimation of uncertainty bounds. Differently from conventional machine learning methods that extract patterns from a given set of data without any prior belief, a Gaussian process assigns probability distributions to different functions that possibly represent the data set which can be further updates using Bayes' rule as more data points are observed. For instance, unlike deep neural networks, the GPR model requires only a few sample points to update its prior beliefs in real-time. Furthermore, we propose a proactive resource allocation scheme that dynamically adjusts resources according to predicted interference. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against two benchmarks prediction schemes, a moving average-based estimator and the ideal genie-aided estimator. The GPR-based method outperforms the moving average-based estimator and achieves near-optimal performance, closely matching the genie-aided benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Polarization Feature Fusion Network for Radar Automatic Target Recognition Based On HRRP Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in radar automatic target recognition (RATR) techniques utilizing deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance, largely due to their robust generalization capabilities. To address the challenge for applications with polarimetric HRRP sequences, a dual-polarization feature fusion network (DPFFN) is proposed along with a novel two-stage feature fusion strategy. Moreover, a specific fusion loss function is developed, which enables the adaptive generation of comprehensive multi-modal representations from polarimetric HRRP sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network significantly improves performance in radar target recognition tasks, thus validating its effectiveness. The PyTorch implementation of our proposed DPFFN is available at https://github.com/xmpan/DPFFN.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-aided Feature Selection and Model Reduction for DRL-based V2X Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly enhance radio resource management (RRM) in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the lack of explainability in complex deep learning (DL) models poses a challenge for practical implementation. This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)- based framework for feature selection and model complexity reduction in a model-agnostic manner. Applied to a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) setting, our approach addresses the joint sub-band assignment and power allocation problem in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We propose a novel two-stage systematic explainability framework leveraging feature relevance-oriented XAI to simplify the DRL agents. While the former stage generates a state feature importance ranking of the trained models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based importance scores, the latter stage exploits these importance-based rankings to simplify the state space of the agents by removing the least important features from the model input. Simulation results demonstrate that the XAI-assisted methodology achieves 97% of the original MADRL sum-rate performance while reducing optimal state features by 28%, average training time by 11%, and trainable weight parameters by 46% in a network with eight vehicular pairs.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Hardware Architecture for Frame Synchronization at all Noise Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame synchronization is the act of discerning the first bit of a valid data frame inside an incoming transmission. This is particularly important in high-noise environments where the communication channel significantly alters transmitted signals. Sync word frame synchronization is a subcategory of synchronization methods where sync words are detected through digital correlation. Despite its simplicity, this method has been overlooked in literature in favor of more sophisticated and mathematically more optimal solutions. In this article we employ binary sync-word correlation-based synchronization to achieve near perfect frame synchronization at any noise level. The proposed architecture leverages XNOR gates, adder and comparator tree structures to detect sync words that are placed in front of the frames through digital correlation. The tree structures are circuit elements that mimic binary trees in form and provide the summation (adder tree) or the maximum/minimum (comparator tree) of a set of binary numbers as output. Due to their minimalistic nature, synchronization can be implemented practically for very large sync word sizes (&gt;500 bit) with multigigabit bit rates (&gt;20 Gbps) and very high accuracy (10e-5 synchronization error when the bit error rate on the bitstream is close to 0.3) on commercial FPGAs. The architecture also delivers the payload of the frames to its output as an extra function.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Multiplexing With Global Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel modulation technique called globally filtered orthogonal time frequency space (GF-OTFS) which integrates single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA)-based delay-Doppler representation with universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) modulation. Our proposed technique first arranges the frequency-Doppler bins of an orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) frame in adjacency using SC-FDMA and then applies universal filtering to the neighboring signals to mitigate inter-Doppler interference (IDI). By employing this approach, GF-OTFS achieves superior spectral containment and effectively mitigates interference caused by Doppler shifts in dynamic, time-varying channels. This paper also presents a detailed mathematical formulation of the proposed modulation technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted, comparing our GF-OTFS approach to state-of-the-art techniques, including Doppler-resilient UFMC (DR-UFMC) and receiver windowed OTFS (RW-OTFS). Key performance metrics, such as bit error rate (BER) and out-of-band (OOB) emissions, as well as the Doppler spread reduction are analyzed to assess the effectiveness of each approach. The results indicate that our proposed technique achieves comparable BER performance while significantly improving spectral containment.</description>

We introduce an innovative approach that employs Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) with active elements to enhance energy efficiency while ensuring reliability and meeting latency requirements. Our approach incorporates the traffic model, making it practical for real-world scenarios with dynamic traffic loads. We thoroughly analyze the impact of blocklength and packet arrival rate on network performance metrics and investigate the optimal amplitude value and number of RIS elements. Our results indicate that increasing the number of RIS elements from 4 to 400 can improve signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) by 13.64\%. Additionally, optimizing blocklength and packet arrival rate can achieve a 31.68% improvement in energy efficiency and reduced latency. These findings underscore the importance of optimized settings for effective jamming mitigation.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Evaluation of Approximate Softmax Functions for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The softmax function is used as an activation function placed in the output layer of a neural network. It allows extracting the probabilities of the output classes, while introduces a non-linearity to the model. In the field of low-end FPGAs, implementations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require the exploration of optimisation techniques to improve computational efficiency and hardware resource consumption. This work explores approximate computing techniques to implement the softmax function, using Taylor and Pad\'e approximations, and interpolation methods with Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The introduction of approximations aims to reduce the required execution time while reducing the precision of results produced by the softmax function. Each implementation is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for accuracy assessment, and individual performance is verified by taking measurements of execution times. From our evaluation, quadratic interpolation with LUTs achieves the lowest error, but in terms of performance, Taylor and Pad\'e approximations show better execution times, which highlights the existing design trade-off between numerical accuracy and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Wireless Powered Communication Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple fixed position antennas (FPAs) provides integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) services towards low-power devices that are equipped with a single fluid antenna (FA), while the low-power devices use harvested energy to power their own uplink transmission. Using the block correlation channel model, both the downlink and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT) outage probabilities are analyzed under specific port selection strategies, including downlink signal-to-interference ratio-based port selection (DSPS) strategy, downlink energy harvesting power-based port selection (DEPS) strategy, uplink signal-to-noise ratio-based port selection (USPS) strategy, and uplink channel-based port selection (UCPS) strategy. A step function approximation (SFA) approach is also relied upon to derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities, while the lower bounds for uplink WDT outage probabilities are also formulated. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis, which also provide useful guidelines for the system design through the analytical framework.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Machine Learning to Optimize Hybrid Quantum Noise Clusters for Gaussian Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on optimizing the hybrid quantum noise model to improve the capacity of Gaussian quantum channels using Machine Learning (ML) generated clusters. The work specifically leverages Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to model the complex noise characteristics of quantum channels. Hybrid quantum noise, which includes both quantum shot noise and classical Additive-White-Gaussian Noise (AWGN), is modeled as an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions weighted by Poissonian parameters. The study proposes a method to reduce the number of clusters within this noise model, simplifying visualization and improving the accuracy of channel capacity estimations without compromising essential noise characteristics. Key contributions include the reduction of Gaussian clusters while maintaining error tolerances and using the EM algorithm to update quantum channel parameters, leading to more accurate channel capacity. The approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating that ML-enhanced quantum noise clustering significantly improves the channels performance in satellite-based quantum communication systems, specifically for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The work demonstrates that GMM and EM algorithms provide a practical solution for modeling quantum noise in real-time applications, advancing the optimization of quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Polycrystalline Material Decomposition for Hyperspectral Neutron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral neutron tomography is an effective method for analyzing crystalline material samples with complex compositions in a non-destructive manner. Since the counts in the hyperspectral neutron radiographs directly depend on the neutron cross-sections, materials may exhibit contrasting neutron responses across wavelengths. Therefore, it is possible to extract the unique signatures associated with each material and use them to separate the crystalline phases simultaneously.
  We introduce an autonomous material decomposition (AMD) algorithm to automatically characterize and localize polycrystalline structures using Bragg edges with contrasting neutron responses from hyperspectral data. The algorithm estimates the linear attenuation coefficient spectra from the measured radiographs and then uses these spectra to perform polycrystalline material decomposition and reconstructs 3D material volumes to localize materials in the spatial domain. Our results demonstrate that the method can accurately estimate both the linear attenuation coefficient spectra and associated reconstructions on both simulated and experimental neutron data.</description>

Abstract: Scoring sleep stages in polysomnography recordings is a time-consuming task plagued by significant inter-rater variability. Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</description>

      <title>Performance of Double-Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Multiuser Massive MIMO Communications in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for shaping the propagation environment, it consists of a single-layer structure within inherent limitations regarding the number of beam steering patterns. Based on the recently revolutionary technology, denoted as stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), we propose its implementation not only on the base station (BS) side in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup but also in the intermediate space between the base station and the users to adjust the environment further as needed. For the sake of convenience, we call the former BS SIM (BSIM), and the latter channel SIM (CSIM). Hence, we achieve wave-based combining at the BS and wave-based configuration at the intermediate space. Specifically, we propose a channel estimation method with reduced overhead, being crucial for SIMassisted communications. Next, we derive the uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Notably, we optimize the phase shifts of both BSIM and CSIM simultaneously by using the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Compared to previous works on SIMs, we study the uplink transmission, a mMIMO setup, channel estimation in a single phase, a second SIM at the intermediate space, and simultaneous optimization of the two SIMs. Simulation results show the impact of various parameters on the sum SE, and demonstrate the superiority of our optimization approach compared to the alternating optimization (AO) method.</description>

      <title>Coded Beam Training for RIS Assisted Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as one of the key technologies for future 6G communications. To fully unleash the performance of RIS, accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial. Beam training is widely utilized to acquire the CSI. However, before aligning the beam correctly to establish stable connections, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at UE is inevitably low, which reduces the beam training accuracy. To deal with this problem, we exploit the coded beam training framework for RIS systems, which leverages the error correction capability of channel coding to improve the beam training accuracy under low SNR. Specifically, we first extend the coded beam training framework to RIS systems by decoupling the base station-RIS channel and the RIS-user channel. For this framework, codewords that accurately steer to multiple angles is essential for fully unleashing the error correction capability. In order to realize effective codeword design in RIS systems, we then propose a new codeword design criterion, based on which we propose a relaxed Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) based codeword design scheme by considering the constant modulus constraints of RIS elements. In addition, considering the two dimensional structure of RIS, we further propose a dimension reduced encoder design scheme, which can not only guarentee a better beam shape, but also enable a stronger error correction capability. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can realize effective and accurate beam training in low SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: self-supervised learning with Unknown Noise level and Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the distribution, and ii) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution. The first class of methods tends to be impractical, as the noise level is often unknown in real-world applications, and the second class is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.</description>

      <title>What If We Had Used a Different App? Reliable Counterfactual KPI Analysis in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), the operation of the radio access network (RAN) is managed by applications, or apps for short, deployed at intelligent controllers. These apps are selected from a given catalog based on current contextual information. For instance, a scheduling app may be selected on the basis of current traffic and network conditions. Once an app is chosen and run, it is no longer possible to directly test the key performance indicators (KPIs) that would have been obtained with another app. In other words, we can never simultaneously observe both the actual KPI, obtained by the selected app, and the counterfactual KPI, which would have been attained with another app, for the same network condition, making individual-level counterfactual KPIs analysis particularly challenging. This what-if analysis, however, would be valuable to monitor and optimize the network operation, e.g., to identify suboptimal app selection strategies. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the values of KPIs that would have been obtained if a different app had been implemented by the RAN. To this end, we propose a conformal-prediction-based counterfactual analysis method for wireless systems that provides reliable error bars for the estimated KPIs, despite the inherent covariate shift between logged and test data. Experimental results for medium access control-layer apps and for physical-layer apps demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast Hyperspectral Reconstruction for Neutron Computed Tomography Using Subspace Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral neutron computed tomography enables 3D non-destructive imaging of the spectral characteristics of materials. In traditional hyperspectral reconstruction, the data for each neutron wavelength bin is reconstructed separately. This per-bin reconstruction is extremely time-consuming due to the typically large number of wavelength bins. Furthermore, these reconstructions may suffer from severe artifacts due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in each wavelength bin.
  We present a novel fast hyperspectral reconstruction algorithm for computationally efficient and accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral neutron data. Our algorithm uses a subspace extraction procedure that transforms hyperspectral data into low-dimensional data within an intermediate subspace. This step effectively reduces data dimensionality and spectral noise. High-quality reconstructions are then performed within this low-dimensional subspace. Finally, the algorithm expands the subspace reconstructions into hyperspectral reconstructions. We apply our algorithm to measured neutron data and demonstrate that it reduces computation and improves reconstruction quality compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</description>

      <title>DFingerNet: Noise-Adaptive Speech Enhancement for Hearing Aids</title>

Abstract: The DeepFilterNet (DFN) architecture was recently proposed as a deep learning model suited for hearing aid devices. Despite its competitive performance on numerous benchmarks, it still follows a `one-size-fits-all' approach, which aims to train a single, monolithic architecture that generalises across different noises and environments. However, its limited size and computation budget can hamper its generalisability. Recent work has shown that in-context adaptation can improve performance by conditioning the denoising process on additional information extracted from background recordings to mitigate this. These recordings can be offloaded outside the hearing aid, thus improving performance while adding minimal computational overhead. We introduce these principles to the DFN model, thus proposing the DFingerNet (DFiN) model, which shows superior performance on various benchmarks inspired by the DNS Challenge.</description>
