      <title>Interacting vertex reinforced random walks on complete sub-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a model for interacting vertex-reinforced random walks, each taking values on a complete sub-graph of a locally finite undirected graph. The transition probability for a walk to a given vertex depends on the cumulative proportion of visits by all walks that have access to that vertex. Proportions are modified by multiplication by a real valued interaction parameter and the addition of a parameter representing the intrinsic preference of the walk for the vertex. This model covers a wide range of interactions, including the cooperation (attraction) or competition (repulsion) of several walks at single vertices. We are principally concerned with strong laws for the proportion of visits to each vertex by all walks. We prove that this measure converges almost surely towards the set of fixed points of the transition probabilities. Almost sure convergence to a single fixed point is in fact the generic behaviour as we show this to hold for almost all parameter values of our model.
  Beyond almost sure convergence, our model allows for a detailed description of the limiting behaviour depending on the interaction parameters and the sub-graph geometries. This is illustrated by several examples of the competitive version of the dynamics, including interacting walks sharing all the vertices of finite complete graphs and walks confined to complete sub-graphs of star graphs and cycles.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the percolation energy field and its logarithmic partner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For site percolation on the triangular lattice, we define two lattice fields that form a logarithmic pair in the sense of conformal field theory. We show that, at the critical point, their two- and three-point correlation functions have well-defined scaling limits, whose structure agrees with that predicted for logarithmic field theories. One of the two fields can be identified with the percolation analog of the Ising energy field, while the other is related to the percolation four-arm event.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Gaussian Random Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some geometric properties of non-smooth random curves within a stochastic flow. We consider a polygonal line $\Gamma(\vec{u}_{1},\cdots,\vec{u}_{n})$, which connects the points \(\vec{u}_{1},\cdots,\vec{u}_{n}\in{\mathbb{R}^{d}}\) and is inscribed in a Brownian trajectory. Subsequently, we estimate the probability that a polygonal line is almost inscribed in a Brownian trajectory. Next, we turn to the study of the self-intersection local time of Brownian motion and demonstrate the asymptotic result of its conditional expectation as the size of the polygonal line increases. Finally, taking such a Brownian trajectory as the initial curve, we let it evolve according to the solution of the equation with interaction. Then, we prove that its visitation density exhibits an intermittency phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Approximation of Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world phenomena can be modelled as dynamical processes on networks, a prominent example being the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Mean-field approximations are a widely used tool to analyse such dynamical processes on networks, but these are typically derived using plausible probabilistic reasoning, introducing uncontrolled errors that may lead to invalid mathematical conclusions. In this paper we present a rigorous approach to derive mean-field approximations from the exact description of Markov chain dynamics on networks through a process of averaging called approximate lumping. We consider a general class of Markov chain dynamics on networks in which each vertex can adopt a finite number of ``vertex-states'' (e.g. susceptible, infected, recovered etc.), and transition rates depend on the number of neighbours of each type. Our approximate lumping is based on counting the number of each type of vertex-state in subsets of vertices, and this results in a density dependent population process. In the large graph limit, this reduces to a low dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, special cases of which are well known mean-field approximations. Our approach provides a general framework for the derivation of mean-field approximations of dynamics on networks that unifies previously disconnected approaches and highlights the sources of error.</description>

      <title>Shape Theorem for the Contact Process in a Dynamical Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contact process in a dynamical random environment defined on the vertices and edges of a graph. For a broad class of processes, we establish an asymptotic shape theorem for the set H_t, which represents the vertices that have been infected up to time t. More precisely, we show that this asymptotic shape is characterized -- similar to the basic contact process -- by a cone spanned by a convex set U, provided certain growth conditions are satisfied. Notably, we find that the asymptotic shape is independent of the initial configuration of the environment. Furthermore, we verify the growth conditions for various types of random environments, such as the contact process on a dynamical graph or a system with switching vertex states, where the monotonicity of the entire process is not guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Large-scale concentration and relaxation for mean-field Langevin particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics of diffusive particles with regular pairwise interactions under mean-field scaling. By approximating empirical distributions with conditional distributions, we establish coercive and contractive properties for the modulated free energy functional. These properties yield near-optimal large-scale concentration and relaxation rates for the particle system throughout the subcritical regime. Furthermore, we derive generation of chaos estimates with the optimal order of particle approximation. As a simpler instance, we demonstrate long-time convergence of the independent projection of Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>A limit theorem for Hausdorff approximation by random inscribed polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate a smooth convex body $K$ with nonvanishing curvature by the convex hull of $n$ independent random points sampled from its boundary $\partial K$. In case the points are distributed according to the optimal density, we prove that the rescaled approximation error in Hausdorff distance tends to a Gumbel distributed random variable. The proof is based on an asymptotic relation to covering properties of random geodesic balls on $\partial K$ and on a limit theorem due to Janson.</description>

      <title>An $L^0$-approach to stochastic evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for studying pathwise time regularity and numerical approximation of $L^0$-valued stochastic evolution equations. At the core of our framework are two Burkholder--Davis--Gundy type inequalities accommodating It\^o integrals with respect to only stochastically integrable processes. The first of these inequalities is formulated in suitable metrics which metrize convergence in probability on the space of integrands and integrals. The second is a modified version, tailored for deriving pathwise properties of the integral. By combining it with a refined version of the Kolmogorov continuity test, we obtain a powerful method for deriving H\"older regularity of It\^o integrals in their most general form. Moreover, it provides a simple and powerful way of deriving rates of pathwise convergence of numerical approximations of stochastic evolution equations. Both applications are illustrated for a class of linear parabolic stochastic evolution equations with generalized Whittle--Mat\'ern type noise, and our findings are verified by numerical experiments from this setting.</description>

      <title>Clustering of quantum correlations at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying conditions for the clustering of correlations in thermal states is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. In the low temperature regime, the problem is subtle, because it is intimately connected to phase transitions. Here we investigate quantum lattice Hamiltonians that are sums of on-site terms and relatively bounded perturbations. We present a direct proof that the thermal state satisfies exponential decay of correlations at low temperature, with a correlation length that stays uniformly bounded as $T\to0$. The proof develops a quantum many-body adaptation of a probabilistic swapping trick of the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) for lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Physical blowups via buffered time change in a mean-field neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idealized networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like interactions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit. These equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling, the mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic synchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is the key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in mean-field neural models. Such a treatment is possible via time change techniques for a Poissonian variation of the classically considered integrate-and-fire dynamics. However, just as for shock solutions for nonlinear conservation laws, there are several admissible blowup solutions to the corresponding McKean-Vlasov equations. Because of this ambiguity, it is unclear which notion of blowup solutions shall be adopted. Here, we unambiguously define physical blowup dynamics as solutions to a fixed-point problem bearing on the time change associated to the McKean-Vlasov equation. To justify the physicality of this formulation, we introduce a buffering mechanism that regularizes blowup dynamics, while satisfying the same conservation principles as the finite-dimensional particle-system dynamics. We then show that physical blowup dynamics are recovered from these regularized solutions in the limit of vanishing buffering. Our approach also shows that these physical solutions are unique, globally defined, and avoid the so-called eternal blowup phenomenon, as long as the neurons exhibit nonzero, distributed refractory periods, a reasonable modeling assumption.</description>

      <title>Vector preference-based contextual bandits under distributional shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Estimating the growth rate of a birth and death process using data from a small sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the growth rate of a birth and death processes based on the coalescence times of a sample of $n$ individuals has been considered by several authors (\cite{stadler2009incomplete, williams2022life, mitchell2022clonal, Johnson2023}). This problem has applications, for example, to cancer research, when one is interested in determining the growth rate of a clone.
  Recently, \cite{Johnson2023} proposed an analytical method for estimating the growth rate using the theory of coalescent point processes, which has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive methods when the sample size $n$ is large. We use a similar approach to obtain an estimate of the growth rate that is not based on the assumption that $n$ is large.
  We demonstrate, through simulations using the R-package \texttt{cloneRate}, that our estimator for the growth rate has a smaller mean squared error than previous estimates when $n$ is small.</description>

      <title>Power-law correction in the probability density function of the critical Ising magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the critical point, the probability density function of the Ising magnetization is believed to decay like $\exp{(-x^{\delta+1})}$, where $\delta$ is the Ising critical exponent that controls the decay to zero of the magnetization in a vanishing external field. In this paper, we discuss the presence of a power-law correction $x^{\frac{\delta-1}{2}}$, which has been debated in the physics literature. We argue that whether such a correction is present or not is related to the asymptotic behavior of a function that measures the extent to which the average magnetization of a finite system with an external field is influenced by the boundary conditions. Our discussion is informed by a mixture of heuristic calculations and rigorous results. Along the way, we review some recent results on the critical Ising model and prove properties of the average magnetization in two dimensions which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In a first part, we define the continuous Yang-Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L{\'e}vy, then we show in a second part how to derive Migdal's character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L{\'e}vy and Ma{\"i}da with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large $N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <title>Underdamped Langevin MCMC with third order convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).</description>

Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric super-Heston-rough volatility model with Zumbach effect as scaling limit of quadratic Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawkes processes were first introduced to obtain microscopic models for the rough volatility observed in asset prices. Scaling limits of such processes leads to the rough-Heston model that describes the macroscopic behavior. Blanc et al. (2017) show that Time-reversal asymmetry (TRA) or the Zumbach effect can be modeled using Quadratic Hawkes (QHawkes) processes. Dandapani et al. (2021) obtain a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limit of QHawkes processes in the case where the impact of buying and selling actions are symmetric. To model asymmetry in buying and selling actions, we propose a bivariate QHawkes process and derive a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limits for the price process in the stable and near-unstable regimes that preserves TRA. A new feature of the limiting process in the near-unstable regime is that the two driving Brownian motions exhibit a stochastic covariation that depends on the spot volatility.</description>

      <title>Size of chaos for Gibbs measures of mean field interacting diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Gibbs measures for diffusive particles interacting through a two-body mean field energy. By identifying a gradient structure for the conditional law, we derive sharp bounds on the size of chaos, providing a quantitative characterization of particle independence. To handle interaction forces that are unbounded at infinity, we study the concentration of measure phenomenon for Gibbs measures via a defective Talagrand inequality, which may hold independent interest. Our approach provides a unified framework for both the flat semi-convex and displacement convex cases. Additionally, we establish sharp chaos bounds for the quartic Curie-Weiss model in the sub-critical regime, demonstrating the generality of this method.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a sufficient (non-Gaussian) affine-ergodic-interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\textsf{AR}(p)$ and $\textsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretically justified and practically applicable slice sampling based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for approximate sampling from probability measures on Riemannian manifolds. The latter naturally arise as posterior distributions in Bayesian inference of matrix-valued parameters, for example belonging to either the Stiefel or the Grassmann manifold. Our method, called geodesic slice sampling, is reversible with respect to the distribution of interest, and generalizes Hit-and-run slice sampling on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to Riemannian manifolds by using geodesics instead of straight lines. We demonstrate the robustness of our sampler's performance compared to other MCMC methods dealing with manifold valued distributions through extensive numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real data. In particular, we illustrate its remarkable ability to cope with anisotropic target densities, without using gradient information and preconditioning.</description>

Abstract: Using the framework of weak Poincar\'e inequalities, we provide a general comparison between Hybrid and Ideal Slice Sampling in terms of their corresponding Dirichlet forms. In particular, under suitable assumptions Hybrid Slice Sampling inherits fast convergence from Ideal Slice Sampling and conversely. We apply our results to analyse the convergence of the Independent Metropolis-Hastings, stepping-out and shrinkage, as well as Hit-and-Run within slice sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries of Service: Interdependence and Synchronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On many dimensions, services can be seen to exist along spectra measuring the degree of interaction between customer and agent. For instance, every interaction features some number of contributions by each of those two sides, creating a spectrum of interdependence. Additionally, each interaction is further characterized by the relative pacing of these contributions, implying a spectrum of synchronicity. Where a service falls on such spectra can be a consequence of its design, but it can also be a function of its state. For instance, as broadly evidenced empirically, an agent with several concurrent interactions will be slowed in each individual interaction, altering the service's synchronicity. Here, we study a Hawkes cluster model of the service interaction, which we show captures the interdependence and synchronicity spectra and their resulting customer-agent (a)symmetries. We find insightful connections to behavioral operations, such as proving the occurrence of non-monotonic performance (e.g., inverted-U throughput) from concurrency-driven asynchrony. Hence, we can prescribe the agent's optimal concurrency level. Furthermore, we show how the service design dictates the efficacy of these operational improvements, proving that the concurrency-optimized throughput is itself non-monotonic as a function of the interdependence. Of possible independent interest methodologically, we establish an interpretable temporal decomposition for Hawkes clusters.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Simulating stochastic population dynamics: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.</description>
