      <title>Earthquake Response Analysis with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A timely and effective response is crucial to minimize damage and save lives during natural disasters like earthquakes. Microblogging platforms, particularly Twitter, have emerged as valuable real-time information sources for such events. This work explores the potential of leveraging Twitter data for earthquake response analysis. We develop a machine learning (ML) framework by incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze relevant information from tweets posted during earthquake events. The approach primarily focuses on extracting location data from tweets to identify affected areas, generating severity maps, and utilizing WebGIS to display valuable information. The insights gained from this analysis can aid emergency responders, government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and NGOs in enhancing their disaster response strategies and facilitating more efficient resource allocation during earthquake events.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Climate Change Debate in Italy through Information Supply and Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of the twenty-first century. Public understanding of climate issues and of the goals regarding the climate transition is essential to translate awareness into concrete actions. Social media platforms play a crucial role in disseminating information about climate change and climate policy. In this context, we propose a model that analyses the Supply and Demand of information to better understand information circulation and information voids within the Italian climate-transition discourse. We conceptualise information supply as the production of content on Facebook and Instagram while leveraging Google searches to capture information demand. Our findings highlight the persistence of information voids, which can hinder informed decision-making and collective action. Furthermore, we observe that the dynamics of information supply and demand on climate-related topics tend to intensify in response to significant external events, shaping public attention and social media discourse.</description>

      <title>Towards Open Diversity-Aware Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Media and the Internet have catalyzed an unprecedented potential for exposure to human diversity in terms of demographics, talents, opinions, knowledge, and the like. However, this potential has not come with new, much needed, instruments and skills to harness it. This paper presents our work on promoting richer and deeper social relations through the design and development of the "Internet of Us", an online platform that uses diversity-aware Artificial Intelligence to mediate and empower human social interactions. We discuss the multiple facets of diversity in social settings, the multidisciplinary work that is required to reap the benefits of diversity, and the vision for a diversity-aware hybrid human-AI society.</description>

      <title>SoMeR: Multi-View User Representation Learning for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media user representation learning aims to capture user preferences, interests, and behaviors in low-dimensional vector representations. These representations are critical to a range of social problems, including predicting user behaviors and detecting inauthentic accounts. However, existing methods are either designed for commercial applications, or rely on specific features like text contents, activity patterns, or platform metadata, failing to holistically model user behavior across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose SoMeR, a Social Media user Representation learning framework that incorporates temporal activities, text contents, profile information, and network interactions to learn comprehensive user portraits. SoMeR encodes user post streams as sequences of time-stamped textual features, uses transformers to embed this along with profile data, and jointly trains with link prediction and contrastive learning objectives to capture user similarity. We demonstrate SoMeR's versatility through three applications: 1) Identifying information operation driver accounts, 2) Measuring online polarization after major events, and 3) Predicting future user participation in Reddit hate communities. SoMeR provides new solutions to better understand user behavior in the socio-political domains, enabling more informed decisions and interventions.</description>

      <title>Compressing regularized dynamics improves link prediction with the map equation in sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future interactions or novel links in networks is an indispensable tool across diverse domains, including genetic research, online social networks, and recommendation systems. Among the numerous techniques developed for link prediction, those leveraging the networks' community structure have proven highly effective. For example, the recently proposed MapSim predicts links based on a similarity measure derived from the code structure of the map equation, a community-detection objective function that operates on network flows. However, the standard map equation assumes complete observations and typically identifies many small modules in networks where the nodes connect through only a few links. This aspect can degrade MapSim's performance on sparse networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose to incorporate a global regularization method based on a Bayesian estimate of the transition rates along with three local regularization methods. The regularized versions of the map equation compensate for incomplete observations and mitigate spurious community fragmentation in sparse networks. The regularized methods outperform standard MapSim and several state-of-the-art embedding methods in highly sparse networks. This performance holds across multiple real-world networks with randomly removed links, simulating incomplete observations. Among the proposed regularization methods, the global approach provides the most reliable community detection and the highest link prediction performance across different network densities. The principled method requires no hyperparameter tuning and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the embedding methods.</description>

      <title>Auditing Political Exposure Bias: Algorithmic Amplification on Twitter/X During the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximately 50% of tweets in X's user timelines are personalized recommendations from accounts they do not follow. This raises a critical question: What political content are users exposed to beyond their established networks, and what implications does this have for democratic discourse online? In this paper, we present a six-week audit of X's algorithmic content recommendations during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election by deploying 120 sock-puppet monitoring accounts to capture tweets from their personalized "For You" timelines. Our objective is to quantify out-of-network content exposure for right- and left-leaning user profiles and assess any potential inequalities and biases in political exposure. Our findings indicate that X's algorithm skews exposure toward a few high-popularity accounts across all users, with right-leaning users experiencing the highest level of exposure inequality. Both left- and right-leaning users encounter amplified exposure to accounts aligned with their own political views and reduced exposure to opposing viewpoints. Additionally, we observe that new accounts experience a right-leaning bias in exposure within their default timelines. Our work contributes to understanding how content recommendation systems may induce and reinforce biases while exacerbating vulnerabilities among politically polarized user groups. We underscore the importance of transparency-aware algorithms in addressing critical issues such as safeguarding election integrity and fostering a more informed digital public sphere.</description>

      <title>Affective Polarization Amongst Swedish Politicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates affective polarization among Swedish politicians on Twitter from 2021 to 2023, including the September 2022 parliamentary election. Analyzing over 25,000 tweets and employing large language models (LLMs) for sentiment and political classification, we distinguish between positive partisanship (support of allies) and negative partisanship (criticism of opponents).
  Our findings are contingent on the definition of the in-group. When political in-groups are defined at the ideological bloc level, negative and positive partisanship occur at similar rates. However, when the in-group is defined at the party level, negative partisanship becomes significantly more dominant and is 1.51 times more likely (1.45, 1.58). This effect is even stronger among extreme politicians, who engage in negativity more than their moderate counterparts. Negative partisanship also proves to be a strategic choice for online visibility, attracting 3.18 more likes and 1.69 more retweets on average.
  By adapting methods developed for two-party systems and leveraging LLMs for Swedish-language analysis, we provide novel insights into how multiparty politics shapes polarizing discourse. Our results underscore both the strategic appeal of negativity in digital spaces and the growing potential of LLMs for large-scale, non-English political research.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>
