      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75\% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88\% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>

      <title>The structure of deviations from maximum parsimony for densely-sampled data and applications for clade support estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms go astray when they return incorrect trees? This simple question has not been answered in detail, even for maximum parsimony (MP), the simplest phylogenetic criterion. Understanding MP has recently gained relevance in the regime of extremely dense sampling, where each virus sample commonly differs by zero or one mutation from another previously sampled virus. Although recent research shows that evolutionary histories in this regime are close to being maximally parsimonious, the structure of their deviations from MP is not yet understood. In this paper, we develop algorithms to understand how the correct tree deviates from being MP in the densely sampled case. By applying these algorithms to simulations that realistically mimic the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we find that simulated trees frequently only deviate from maximally parsimonious trees locally, through simple structures consisting of the same mutation appearing independently on sister branches. We leverage this insight to design approaches for sampling near-MP trees and using them to efficiently estimate clade supports.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</description>
