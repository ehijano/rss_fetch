      <title>Full classification of de Finetti type theorems for *-random variables in classical and free probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical distributional symmetries can be described as invariance under the actions of semigroups (or groups) of matrix structures, and subsequently under the coactions of continuous functions on the matrix semigroups (or groups) generated by entry functions. By considering noncommutative entry functions on matrix structures, Woronowicz introduced corepresentations of compact quantum groups, namely Woronowicz's $C^*$-algebras (also known as compact matrix pseudogroups). We demonstrate that every nontrivial finite sequence of random variables admits a maximal distributional symmetry determined by a Woronowicz $C^*$-algebra. This establishes a probabilistic framework for classifying compact quantum groups. Furthermore, we classify all de Finetti-type theorems for *-random variables that are invariant under distributional symmetries arising from compact matrix quantum groups in both classical and free probability settings. Our results show that only finitely many types of de Finetti theorems exist in these contexts, and the associated categories of (quantum) groups are the easy (quantum) groups introduced by Banica and Speicher.</description>

      <title>Fields of Toeplitz algebras for the principal symbol of regular 2-step nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the C*-algebra of a regular 2-step nilpotent lie group can be recovered using continuous fields of Toeplitz algebras and a crossed product. We generalize this result to polycontact manifolds in the sense of van Erp which are endowed with fields of such groups. We also investigate those manifolds with a more rigid structure, namely those modeled on H-type groups. In all those cases, there is a certain pseudodifferential calculus named filtered calculus, we show that the algebra of principal symbols can also be recovered from the field of Toeplitz algebras.</description>

      <title>W*-Amenability for Fell bundles over discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate amenability for $W^*$-Fell bundles over a discrete group $G$, with a focus on its characterization via approximation properties and conditional expectations. Building on the notion of $W^*$-amenability, we construct an enlarged $W^*$-Fell bundle analogous to $\ell^\infty(G, M)$ for a group action $G$ on a von Neumann algebra $M$, and relate amenability to the existence of suitable conditional expectations at both the bundle and crossed-product levels. Our results unify and extend several approaches to amenability for noncommutative dynamical systems.
  As applications of our methods, we prove that amenability of Fell bundles passes to restrictions to subgroups and that a Fell bundle over a group $G$ is amenable if and only if both its restriction to a normal subgroup $H \trianglelefteq G$ and the associated quotient Fell bundle over $G/H$ are amenable. This provides a powerful structural tool that extends classical permanence results for group amenability to the setting of \Wstar Fell bundles and also \cstar algebraic Fell bundles. We also discuss how Fell bundles and their amenability interact with group coactions on $C^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>The Leavitt inverse semigroup of a separated graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse semigroup associated to a separated graph $(E,C)$, which we call the \emph{Leavitt inverse semigroup}. This semigroup is obtained as a quotient of the separated graph inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$, introduced in our previous paper [9], and it provides a canonical inverse semigroup model for the tame Leavitt path algebra $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$ over a commutative unital ring $K$.
  Our first main result describes the Leavitt inverse semigroup $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ as a restricted semidirect product of the free group on the edges of $E$ acting partially on a certain semilattice, which is isomorphic to the semilattice of idempotents of $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$. This description, given in terms of Leavitt--Munn trees, yields a normal form for the elements of $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$.
  We obtain a normal form for elements of $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$, leading to explicit linear bases for $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$. Building on this and on the structural properties of $\mathcal{LI} (E,C)$, we prove that the natural homomorphism from $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ to $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$ is injective, so that $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ embeds as the inverse semigroup generated by the canonical partial isometries in $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$. Further applications include the determination of natural bases of the kernel $\mathcal Q$ of the natural map from the tame Cohn algebra $\mathcal{C}_K^\mathrm{ab} (E,C)$ to the tame Leavitt path algebtra $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab} (E,C)$, the computation of the socle, and a characterization of the isolated points of the spectrum. Several examples, such as the Cuntz separated graph and free separations, are discussed to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics of infinite particle systems in an operator algebraic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct C*-dynamical systems for the dynamics of classical infinite particle systems describing harmonic oscillators interacting with arbitrarily many neighbors on lattices, as well on more general structures. Our approach allows particles with varying masses, varying frequencies, irregularly placed lattice sites and varying interactions subject to a simple summability constraint. A key role is played by the commutative resolvent algebra, which is a C*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on an infinite dimensional vector space, and in a strong sense the classical limit of the Buchholz--Grundling resolvent algebra, which suggests that quantum analogs of our results are likely to exist. For a general class of Hamiltonians, we show that the commutative resolvent algebra is time-stable, and admits a time-stable sub-algebra on which the dynamics is strongly continuous, therefore obtaining a C*-dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of amenability for noncommutative dynamical systems and Fell bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for a locally compact group $G$, a $C^*$-dynamical system $(A,G,\alpha)$ is amenable if and only if, for every other system $(B,G,\beta)$, the diagonal system $(A \otimes_{\max} B, G, \alpha \otimes^d_{\max} \beta)$ has the weak containment property (wcp).
  For Fell bundles over $G$, we construct a diagonal tensor product $\otimes^d_{\max}$ and show that a Fell bundle $\mathcal{A}$ has the positive approximation property of Exel and Ng (AP) precisely when $\mathcal{A} \otimes^d_{\max} \mathcal{B}$ has the wcp for every Fell bundle $\mathcal{B}$ over $G$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{A}$ has the AP if and only if the natural action of $G$ on the $C^*$-algebra of kernels of $\mathcal{A}$ is amenable.
  We show that the approximation properties introduced by Abadie and by B\'edos-Conti are equivalent to the AP. We also study the permanence of the wcp, the AP, and the nuclearity of cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras under restrictions, quotients, and other constructions.
  Our results extend and unify previous characterizations of amenability for $C^*$-dynamical systems and Fell bundles, and provide new tools to analyze structural properties of associated $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry entails the Jordan algebra structure of finite-dimensional quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices and a generalized version of Gleason's theorem for Jordan matrix algebras, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Quantaloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to add a symmetric monoidal structure to quantaloids in a compatible way. In particular, dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. Examples of such quantaloids are the category qRel of quantum sets and binary relations, and the category V-Rel of sets and binary relations with values in a commutative quantale V. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. Discrete quantization, a process of generalization of mathematical structures to the noncommutative setting can be regarded as the process of internalizing these structures in qRel, whereas fuzzification, the process of introducing degrees of truth or membership to concepts that are traditionally considered either true or false, can be regarded as the process of internalizing structures in V-Rel. Hence, we investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quantaloids.</description>
