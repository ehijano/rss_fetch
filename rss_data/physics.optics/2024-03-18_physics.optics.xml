      <title>A Terahertz Bandwidth Nonmagnetic Isolator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics could bring transformative breakthroughs in computing, networking, imaging, sensing, and quantum information processing, enabled by increasingly sophisticated optical functionalities on a photonic chip. However, wideband optical isolators, which are essential for the robust operation of practically all optical systems, have been challenging to realize in integrated form due to the incompatibility of magnetic media with these circuit technologies. Here, we present the first-ever demonstration of an integrated non-magnetic optical isolator with terahertz-level optical bandwidth. The system is comprised of two acousto-optic frequency-shifting beam splitters which create a non-reciprocal multimode interferometer exhibiting high-contrast, nonreciprocal light transmission. We dramatically enhance the isolation bandwidth of this system by precisely dispersion balancing the paths of the interferometer. Using this approach, we demonstrate integrated nonmagnetic isolators with an optical contrast as high as 28 dB, insertion losses as low as -2.16 dB, and optical bandwidths as high as 2 THz (16 nm). We also show that the center frequency and direction of optical isolation are rapidly reconfigurable by tuning the relative phase of the microwave signals used to drive the acousto-optic beam splitters. With their CMOS compatibility, wideband operation, low losses, and rapid reconfigurability, such integrated isolators could address a key barrier to the integration of a wide range of photonic functionalities on a chip. Looking beyond the current demonstration, this bandwidth-scalable approach to nonmagnetic isolation opens the door to ultrawideband (&gt;10 THz) isolators, which are needed to shrink state-of-the-art imaging, sensing, and communications systems into photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Scattering Zero Degeneracies for Spectral Management of Coherent Perfect Absorption in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA) protocol for cases where scale invariance is violated due to the presence of nonlinear mechanisms. We demonstrate, using a microwave setting that lacks geometrical symmetries, that the nonlinearity offers new reconfigurable modalities: the destruction or formation of nonlinear CPAs (NL-CPAs), and their frequency positioning and bandwidth management using the incident power as a control knob. The latter occurs via the formation of exceptional point degeneracies of the zeroes of nonlinear scattering processes. Our results establish NL-CPA protocols as a versatile scheme for the creation of reconfigurable hot/cold-spots in complicated enclosures (e.g. buildings or vessels) with applications to next-generation telecommunications, long-range wireless power transfer, and electromagnetic warfare.</description>

      <title>Sensing beyond the exceptional point for high detectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional point (EP)-based optical sensors exhibit exceptional sensitivity but poor detectivity due to their acute sensitivity to perturbations such as noise. When the optical budget is limited as in applications on mobile platforms, high detectivity might be equally important as high sensitivity. In such scenarios, off-EP sensing is advantageous where a slight loss in sensitivity can lead to a significant gain in detectivity. Here, we show that a passive parity-time symmetric plasmonic-photonic hybrid shows a peak in its detectivity off EP where the sensitivity is still very high-surpassing the sensitivities of equivalent fully-plasmonic and fully-photonic systems. We demonstrate the high detectivity of off-EP sensing of anti-mouse IgG protein using this plasmonic-photonic hybrid system. We report a sensitivity of 1.2 nm/nM while requiring a minimum optical budget of 1.3 nJ. Thus, non-Hermitian plasmonic-photonic hybrids could be the best class of nanophotonic sensors for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Spectrum conversion and pattern preservation of Airy beams in fractional systems with a dynamical harmonic-oscillator potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of optical Airy beams in the one-dimensional fractional Schr\"odinger equation with a harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential subjected to modulation along the propagation distance. Deriving general solutions for propagating beams and particular solutions for Airy waves with/without chirp, we study analytically the spectrum conversion and pattern preservation for the chirp-free and chirped Airy beams in the fractional system including the HO potential with moir\'e-lattice, hyperbolic-secant, and delta-functional modulation formats. For the HO-moir\'e-lattice potential, it is found that the chirp-free Airy beam experiences multiple spectrum conversions between the Airy and Gaussian patterns in the momentum space, preserving the Airy pattern in the coordinate space. The chirp magnitude of the chirped Airy beam determines whether the spectrum conversion occurs in the momentum space, and the splitting and evolution direction of the beam in the coordinate space. For the HO-hyperbolic-secant potential, the chirp-free Airy beam undergoes spectrum conversion and tunneling, with the positions of the spectrum conversion and tunneling significantly depending on parameters of the hyperbolic-secant potential; however, the spectrum conversion and pattern preservation of the chirped Airy beam occurs only under a certain relation of the chirp and parameters of the potential. In the case of the HO-delta-functional potential, the chirp-free Airy beam experiences abrupt spectrum conversion and a two-step spectrum shift; however, for the chirped Airy beam, the spectrum conversion is affected by the relation between the chirp and height of the potential. Effects of the fractional L\'evy index on the spectrum conversion and pattern preservation of the Airy beams under the action of the three modulation patterns considered here are also explored in detail.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing extreme-ultraviolet vector beams in a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light has gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the generation and application of vector beams. These beams, characterized by a spatially varying polarization state, are a powerful tool to enhance our capacity to control light-matter interactions. In this study, we demonstrate the synthesis of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) vector beams in a chip through high-order harmonic generation (HHG). Our findings showcase the chip's ability to transfer the laser polarization state into the EUV beam despite the extended interaction length. This approach not only outperforms conventional free-space methods but also paves the way for a multitude of on-chip investigations in the realms of EUV and soft-X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Multiplane Quantitative Phase Imaging Using a Wavelength-Multiplexed Diffractive Optical Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a label-free technique that provides optical path length information for transparent specimens, finding utility in biology, materials science, and engineering. Here, we present quantitative phase imaging of a 3D stack of phase-only objects using a wavelength-multiplexed diffractive optical processor. Utilizing multiple spatially engineered diffractive layers trained through deep learning, this diffractive processor can transform the phase distributions of multiple 2D objects at various axial positions into intensity patterns, each encoded at a unique wavelength channel. These wavelength-multiplexed patterns are projected onto a single field-of-view (FOV) at the output plane of the diffractive processor, enabling the capture of quantitative phase distributions of input objects located at different axial planes using an intensity-only image sensor. Based on numerical simulations, we show that our diffractive processor could simultaneously achieve all-optical quantitative phase imaging across several distinct axial planes at the input by scanning the illumination wavelength. A proof-of-concept experiment with a 3D-fabricated diffractive processor further validated our approach, showcasing successful imaging of two distinct phase objects at different axial positions by scanning the illumination wavelength in the terahertz spectrum. Diffractive network-based multiplane QPI designs can open up new avenues for compact on-chip phase imaging and sensing devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is promising for nanoscale, efficient, ultra-fast photo- and opto-electronic devices because of its remarkable electrical and optical properties, such as fast electron relaxation and heat dissipation. Here, we realize high-performance graphene integrated photonics platform enabled by gold-assisted transfer. Thanks to our optimized transfer technique, we fabricate and demonstrate (1) a microscale thermo-optic modulator with a tuning efficiency of 0.037 nm/mW and high heating performance of 67.4 K${\mu}m^{3}mW^{-1}$ on a small active area of 7.54 ${\mu}m^{2}$ and (2) a graphene electro-absorption modulator featuring an high modulation bandwidth up to 26.8 GHz and a high-speed data rate reaching 48 Gb/s, and (3) a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer modulator with a high normalized modulation efficiency of 0.027 dBV$^{-1}{\mu}m^{-1}$. Our graphene integrated photonics platform has far superior performances compared to state of the art in terms of efficiency, low process complexity, and compact device footage. Thus, our approach and results provide the background for the realization of high-performance integrated photonic circuits with CMOS compatibility.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Single-Beam Coherent Raman Scattering Thermometry Based on Air Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermometric techniques with high accuracy, fast response speed and ease of implementation are desirable for the study of dynamic combustion environments, transient reacting flows, and non-equilibrium plasmas. Herein, single-shot single-beam coherent Raman scattering (SS-CRS) thermometry is developed, for the first time to our knowledge, by using air lasing as a probe. It's proved that the air-lasing-assisted CRS signal has a high signal-to-noise ratio enabling single-shot measurements at a 1 kHz repetition rate. The SS-CRS thermometry consistently exhibits precision better than 2% at different temperatures, but the inaccuracy grows with the increase in temperature. The high detection precision, 1 kHz acquisition rate and easy-to-implement single-beam scheme are achieved thanks to the unique temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics of air lasing. This work opens a novel avenue for high-speed CRS thermometry, holding tremendous potential for fast diagnostics of transient reacting flows and plasmas.</description>

      <title>Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Kerr Comb Spectroscopy on Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broad and equidistant spectrum of frequency combs has had a profound impact on spectroscopic studies. Particularly, experiments involving the coupling of frequency combs to cavities have already enabled unprecedented broadband and sensitive spectroscopy on a single-molecule level. The emergence of integrated, compact and broadband Kerr-microcombs holds promise to bring many metrological and spectroscopic studies outside of the lab. However, performing cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy on-chip has remained a challenge. Here, we couple a microcomb source with a microcavity to extend the advantages of cavity-enhanced spectroscopy to photonically integrated circuits. By harnessing the coherent nature of the Kerr-comb and high-Q microcavity enhancement, we obtain a detailed dispersion landscape of the guided-wave mode and comprehensive frequency-dependent cavity lineshapes. Our microcomb-cavity coupling can facilitate photonically integrated cavity-enhanced biochemical spectroscopy by evanescently coupling analytes to the cavity's guided mode, a mode of operation we analyze and provide guidelines for. Demonstrated detailed dispersion measurements, overperforming state-of-the-art table-top tunable lasers in available bandwidth, show potential for integrated nonlinear optics applications, as precise dispersion management is crucial for such processes. Our chip-scale comb-cavity coupled platform suggests an integrated, broadband, cost-effective and accurate tool for the nonlinear optics studies as well as for ultra-compact bio- and chemical- sensing platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent paper Phys. Rev. X. 14, 011031 (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.01019) includes an appendix that casts doubts on the validity the theory of the transverse orbital angular momentum of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) in Prog. Electromagn. Res. 177, 95 (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.09105). The argumentation in that appendix mixes a mechanical approach where STOVs are seen in space evolving in time with an optical approach where STOVs are seen in space-time evolving with propagation distance, which leads to wrong conclusions. We consistently carry out the analysis from the mechanical approach, and the results confirm the theory in Prog. Electromagn. Res. 177, 95 consistently performed within the optical approach.</description>

      <title>Greater than five-order-of-magnitude post-compression temporal contrast improvement with an ionization plasma grating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity lasers require suppression of prepulses and other non-ideal temporal structure to avoid target disruption before the arrival of the main pulse. To address this, we demonstrate that ionization gratings act as a controllable optical switch for high-power light with a temporal contrast improvement of at least $3\times10^5$ and a switching time less than 500 fs. We also show that a grating system can run for hours at 10 Hz without degradation. The contrast improvement from an ionization grating compares favorably to that achievable with plasma mirrors.</description>

      <title>Scattering Singularity in Topological Dielectric Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of topology in natural materials and metamaterials has garnered significant attention. Notably, the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, assessed through tight-binding approximations, has been extensively investigated in both quantum and classical systems, encompassing general and higher-order topology. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive examination of these models from the perspective of wave physics, particularly the scattering view, remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically unveil the origin of the 1D and 2D Zak phases stemming from the zero-scattering point, termed the scattering singularity in k-space. Employing an expanded plane wave expansion, we accurately compute the reflective spectrum of an infinite 2D photonic crystal (2D-PhC). Analyzing the reflective spectrum reveals the presence of a zero-scattering line in the 2D-PhC, considered the topological origin of the non-trivial Zak phase. Two distinct models, representing omnidirectional non-trivial cases and directional non-trivial cases, are employed to substantiate these findings. Our work introduces a novel perspective for characterizing the nature of non-trivial topological phases. The identification of the zero-scattering line not only enhances our understanding of the underlying physics but also provides valuable insights for the design of innovative devices.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of light-matter strong coupling on chiral nonlinear optical effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter strong coupling (LMSC) is intriguing state in which light and matter are coherently hybridized inside cavity. It has been gaining widespread recognition as an excellent way for controlling material properties without any chemical modification. Here we show the LMSC is a powerful state to manipulate and improve a chiral nonlinear optical (NLO) effect through the investigation of second harmonic generation circular dichroism. At the upper polaritonic band in LMSC, in addition to an enhancement of SHG intensity by more than one order of magnitude, the responsivity to the handedness of circular polarized light is largely modified, where sign inversion and increase of dissymmetric factor is achieved. Quarter wave plate rotation analysis reveals that the LMSC clearly influence the coefficients associated with chirality in NLO process and it also contributes to the enhancement of nonlinear magnetic dipole interactions. This study demonstrates that LMSC serves as a novel platform for control of chiral optoelectronics and magneto-optics.</description>

      <title>Below the Surface: Unraveling the Intricacies of the Nonlinear Optical Properties of Aluminum through Bound Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By uncovering novel aspects of second harmonic generation in aluminum we show that there are unusual and remarkable consequences of resonant absorption, namely an unexpectedly critical role that bound electrons play for light-matter interactions across the optical spectrum, suggesting that a different basic approach is required to fully explain the physics of surfaces. We tackle an issue that is never under consideration given the generic hostile conditions to the propagation of light under resonant absorption. Unlike most noble metals, aluminum displays Lorentz-like behavior and interband transitions centered near 810 nm, thus splitting the plasmonic range in an atypical manner and setting its linear and nonlinear optical properties apart. Studies of aluminum nanostructures having complex topologies abound, as do reported inconsistencies in the linear spectral response of surface plasmons and harmonic generation. Our experimental observations of second harmonic generation from aluminum nanolayers show that bound electrons are responsible for a unique signature neither predicted nor observed previously: a hole in the second harmonic spectrum. A hydrodynamic-Maxwell theory explains these findings exceptionally well and becomes the basis for renewed studies of surface physics.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a thorough comparison of themain QPM techniques, focusing on their accuracy in terms of measurement precision and trueness. We focus on 8 techniques, namely digital holographic microscopy (DHM), cross-grating wavefront microscopy (CGM), which is based on QLSI (quadriwave lateral shearing interferometry), diffraction phase microscopy (DPM), differential phase-contrast (DPC) microscopy, phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) imaging, Fourier phase microscopy (FPM), spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM), and transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) imaging. For this purpose, we used a home-made numerical toolbox based on discrete dipole approximation (IF-DDA). This toolbox is designed to compute the electromagnetic field at the sample plane of a microscope, irrespective of the object's complexity or the illumination conditions. We upgraded this toolbox to enable it to model any type of QPM, and to take into account shot noise. In a nutshell, the results show that DHM and PSI are inherently free from artefacts and rather suffer from coherent noise; In CGM, DPC, DPM and TIE, there is a trade off between precision and trueness, which can be balanced by varying one experimental parameter; FPM and SLIM suffer from inherent artefacts that cannot be discarded experimentally in most cases, making the techniques not quantitative especially for large objects covering a large part of the field of view, such as eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>Sub-photon accuracy noise reduction of single shot coherent diffraction pattern with atomic model trained autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Single-shot imaging with femtosecond X-ray lasers is a powerful measurement technique that can achieve both high spatial and temporal resolution. However, its accuracy has been severely limited by the difficulty of applying conventional noise-reduction processing. This study uses deep learning to validate noise reduction techniques, with autoencoders serving as the learning model. Focusing on the diffraction patterns of nanoparticles, we simulated a large dataset treating the nanoparticles as composed of many independent atoms. Three neural network architectures are investigated: neural network, convolutional neural network and U-net, with U-net showing superior performance in noise reduction and subphoton reproduction. We also extended our models to apply to diffraction patterns of particle shapes different from those in the simulated data. We then applied the U-net model to a coherent diffractive imaging study, wherein a nanoparticle in a microfluidic device is exposed to a single X-ray free-electron laser pulse. After noise reduction, the reconstructed nanoparticle image improved significantly even though the nanoparticle shape was different from the training data, highlighting the importance of transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Measuring Colloidomer Hydrodynamics with Holographic Video Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-line holographic video microscopy records a wealth of information about the microscopic structure and dynamics of colloidal materials. Powerful analytical techniques are available to retrieve that information when the colloidal particles are well-separated. Large assemblies of close-packed particles create holograms that are substantially more challenging to interpret. We demonstrate that Rayleigh-Sommerfeld back-propagation is useful for analyzing holograms of colloidomer chains, close-packed linear assemblies of micrometer-scale emulsion droplets. Colloidomers are fully flexible chains and undergo three-dimensional configurational changes under the combined influence of random thermal forces and hydrodynamic forces. We demonstrate the ability of holographic reconstruction to track these changes as colloidomers sediment through water in a horizontal slit pore. Comparing holographically measured configurational trajectories with predictions of hydrodynamic models both validates the analytical technique for this valuable class of self-organizing materials and also provides insights into the influence of geometric confinement on colloidomer hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Laser Phase Plate for Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low image contrast is a major limitation in transmission electron microscopy, since samples with low atomic number only weakly phase-modulate the illuminating electron beam, and beam-induced sample damage limits the usable electron dose. The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. 
  In this thesis, I present the theory, design, and implementation of the laser phase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase shift the electron beam. A near-concentric Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \, \mathrm{GW}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. 
  We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb Interaction in Valley Photogalvanic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the photogalvanic current of electrons in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric Dirac materials possessing a nontrivial structure of valleys and exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The valley photogalvanic effect occurs here due to the trigonal warping of electrons and holes' dispersions in a given valley of the monolayer. We study the low-frequency limit of the external field: the field frequency is smaller than the temperature $T$, and the electron-electron and electron-hole scattering times are much larger than the electron-impurity scattering time. In this regime, we employ the Boltzmann transport equations and show that electron-hole scattering dominates electron-electron scattering in intrinsic semiconductors. Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the valley photogalvanic current can reduce the value of the bare photogalvanic current as these two currents flow in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Purcell enhancement of quantum dots emitting in the telecom O-band with an open fiber-cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, for each combination of a cavity geometry with a quantum emitter system, there are specific challenges in the optimization of the emission properties and cavity-emitter interaction. Here, we present a thorough investigation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), emitting in the telecom O-band, integrated in an open fiber-cavity. The design provides an optical micro-cavity tunable in all spatial dimensions with intrinsic fiber-coupling. Consequently, it offers a promising approach to a high collection efficiency and the investigation of spatially and spectrally varying samples. On the other hand, the system is also susceptible to vibrational noise. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study of the cavity and emitter properties together with an analysis of the fluctuations of the cavity length. Due to the Purcell enhancement, we observe a reduction of the decay times of up to a factor of ${2.46(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Transverse Magnetic ENZ Resonators: Robustness and Optimal Shape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain ``geometric-invariant resonant cavities'' introduced by Liberal et. al in a 2016 Nature Comm. paper, modeled using the transverse magnetic reduction of Maxwell's equations. The cross-section consists of a dielectric inclusion surrounded by an ``epsilon-near-zero'' (ENZ) shell. When the shell has the right area, its interaction with the inclusion produces a resonance. Mathematically, the resonance is a nontrivial solution of a 2D divergence-form Helmoltz equation $\nabla \cdot \left(\varepsilon^{-1}(x,\omega) \nabla u \right) + \omega^2 \mu u = 0$, where $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is the (complex-valued) dielectric permittivity, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, and a homogeneous Neumann condition is imposed at the outer boundary of the shell. This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, since $\varepsilon$ depends on $\omega$. Use of an ENZ material in the shell means that $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is nearly zero there, so the PDE is rather singular. Working with a Lorentz model for the dispersion of the ENZ material, we put the discussion of Liberal et.~al.~on a sound foundation by proving the existence of the anticipated resonance when the loss is sufficiently small. Our analysis is perturbative in character despite the apparently singular form of the PDE. While the existence of the resonance depends only on the area of the ENZ shell, the rate at which it decays depends on the shape of the shell. We consider an associated optimal design problem: what shape shell gives the slowest-decaying resonance? We prove that if the dielectric inclusion is a ball then the optimal shell is a concentric annulus. For an inclusion of any shape, we study a convex relaxation of the design problem using tools from convex duality, and discuss the conjecture that our relaxed problem amounts to considering homogenization-like limits of nearly optimal designs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the spin dissymmetry factor, a measure of the spin-selectivity in the optical transition rate of quantum particles. This spin dissymmetry factor is valid locally, including at material interfaces and within optical cavities. We design and numerically demonstrate an optical cavity with three-fold rotational symmetry that maximizes spin dissymmetry, thereby minimizing the spin dephasing of a cavity-coupled quantum particle. Our approach emphasizes the difference between spin and chirality in the nearfield and reveals a classical parameter for designing more efficient quantum optical devices.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dimensional Approach to Dielectric Tuning Effects on Excitonic Parameters in 2D semiconductor materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated the potential of the fractional dimensional approach to understand exciton parameters in the exemplary atomically thin semiconductor material, a monolayer of WS$_2$. This approach has proved to be successful in finding the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle bandgap for the WS$_2$ monolayer in varying dielectric environments. A tuning of the quasiparticle bandgap and binding energy by 141 meV and 188 meV, respectively, has been achieved by varying the dielectric of the environment from 1.52 to 8.1. The approach is justified by comparing the changes in the binding energy with the computational results from the Quantum Electrostatic Heterostructures model. The fractional dimension found through the excitonic Rydberg series is close to 2.8 for WS$_2$ monolayer in all different dielectric surroundings. Thus, this approach provides a rapid and robust method for determining the binding energy of excitons in 2D semiconductors independent of the particular dielectric environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>Effect of photoinduced screening on the spectroscopic signature of exciton-phonon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focusses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $N\leq4$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this letter, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates are localized on a subset of sites and are exhibiting the NH skin effect. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

Abstract: Molecular strong coupling offers exciting prospects in physics, chemistry and materials science. Whilst attention has been focused on including realistic models for the molecular systems involved, the important role played by the entire mode structure of the optical cavities employed so far has been largely overlooked. We show that the extent and effectiveness of molecular strong coupling is critically dependent on cavity finesse. Low finesse cavities can show strong coupling as judged from the presence of Rabi splitting in reflectivity measurements, but give photoluminescence signals equivalent to that of bare molecules outside the cavity. The emission of light is shown to involve hybridized light-matter polaritonic states only for cavities with high finesse. By developing an analytical model of cavity photoluminescence in multimode structures, we clarify the role of finite finesse in polariton formation. The detailed nature of the modes supported by a cavity and how these modes interact with the molecular system - whether on resonance or not - will be as important in developing a coherent framework for molecular strong coupling as the inclusion of realistic molecular models.</description>

Abstract: Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). We demonstrate that a resonant nanophotonic structure modifies the apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work presents a promising avenue to manipulate dimensionality in an ensemble of interacting emitters.</description>

Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metaphotonics has emerged as a cutting-edge subfield of meta-optics employing subwavelength resonators and their planar structures such as metasurfaces to generate, manipulate, and detect quantum states of light. It holds a great potential for the miniaturization of current bulky quantum optical elements by developing a design of on-chip quantum systems for various applications of quantum technologies. Over the past few years, this field has witnessed a surge of intriguing theoretical ideas, groundbreaking experiments, and novel application proposals. This perspective paper aims to summarize the most recent advancements and also provide a perspective on the further progress in this rapidly developing field of research.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning for ab initio Deep Learned Refractive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep optical optimization has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing computational imaging systems using only the output image as the objective. However, it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single element such as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a DeepLens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces without human intervention, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fully automatically designing both classical imaging lenses and a large field-of-view extended depth-of-field computational lens in a cellphone-style form factor, with highly aspheric surfaces and a short back focal length.</description>

      <title>Cavity magnomechanics: from classical to quantum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Theory of Supervibronic Transitions via Casimir Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remote energy transfer pathway from electronic to vibrational degrees of freedom is identified inside an infrared optical cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions. This mechanism relies on the dynamical Casimir effect, whereby real infrared photons are generated due to a sudden electronic transition of anisotropic molecules. Moreover, the formation of vibrational polaritons enables the excited photon energy to be transferred to the vibrational degrees of freedom before any dissipation occurs. Both analytic solutions and numerical simulations reveal that the magnitude of this electronic to vibrational energy transfer depends quadratically on the number of molecules and resonantly on the vibration-cavity detuning. During this "supervibronic" transition process, because the vibrational energy gain per molecule can be meaningful in the macroscopic limit, this process may potentially be observed using conventional vibrational strong coupling devices.</description>

      <title>Filter-free high-performance single photon emission from a quantum dot in a Fabry-Perot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining resonant excitation with Purcell-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs) stands out as a prominent strategy for realizing high performance solid-state single photon sources. However, optimizing photon efficiency requires addressing challenges associated with effectively separating the excitation laser from QDs' emission. Traditionally, this involves polarization filtering, which limits the achievable polarization directions and the scalability of photonic states. In this study, we have successfully tackled this challenge by employing spatially-orthogonal resonant excitation of QDs, deterministically coupled to monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities. Leveraging the membrane cavity structures, we have achieved filter-free single photon resonant fluorescence. The resulting source produces single photons with a simultaneous high extraction efficiency of 0.87, purity of 0.9045(4), and indistinguishability of 0.963(4).</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>Beneath the Surface: Revealing Deep-Tissue Blood Flow in Human Subjects with Massively Parallelized Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) allows the label-free investigation of microvascular dynamics deep within living tissue. However, common implementations of DCS are currently limited to measurement depths of $\sim 1-1.5cm$, which can limit the accuracy of cerebral hemodynamics measurement. Here we present massively parallelized DCS (pDCS) using novel single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays with up to 500x500 individual channels. The new SPAD array technology can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of up to 500 compared to single-pixel DCS, or by more than 15-fold compared to the most recent state-of-the-art pDCS demonstrations. Our results demonstrate the first in vivo use of this massively parallelized DCS system to measure cerebral blood flow changes at $\sim 2cm$ depth in human adults. We compared different modes of operation and applied a dual detection strategy, where a secondary SPAD array is used to simultaneously assess the superficial blood flow as a built-in reference measurement. While the blood flow in the superficial scalp tissue showed no significant change during cognitive activation, the deep pDCS measurement showed a statistically significant increase in the derived blood flow index of 8-12% when compared to the control rest state.</description>
