      <title>The Plateau Problem of Michell Trusses and Orthogonality in Springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given finitely many pointed forces in the plane. Suppose these forces sum up to zero and their net torques also sum up to zero. Then we can see that there exists a system of springs whose boundary forces exactly counter-balance these pointed forces. We will generalize to higher dimensions using elastic materials. The spring constant will be replaced by Cauchy stress tensor well-known in mechanics. Given a system of springs, we can multiply the length of each spring with its corresponding spring constant and then sum these products up. The result is called the Total Mass of the system. We are interested in the Plateau problem of the existence of the minimal spring system given a boundary condition; moreover, research is still going on searching for an algorithm for a minimizer. This minimization problem was first introduced in 1904 by A. Mitchell. It raised attention in optimal design, such as minimizing costs in building bridges. Then the problem was developed in 1960s by W. Gangbo when he tried to approach it theoretically. In this paper, we are going to solve the Plateau problem using two different tools in GMT: first, a minimizer can be viewed as a flat chain complex; second, a minimizer can also be viewed as a current. At the end, we are going to show one progress in discovering the topological properties of minimizers: compressed and stretched springs must be perpendicular to each other at non-boundary points.</description>

      <title>A Guaranteed-Stable Neural Network Approach for Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising approach to optimal control of nonlinear systems involves iteratively linearizing the system and solving an optimization problem at each time instant to determine the optimal control input. Since this approach relies on online optimization, it can be computationally expensive, and thus unrealistic for systems with limited computing resources. One potential solution to this issue is to incorporate a Neural Network (NN) into the control loop to emulate the behavior of the optimal control scheme. Ensuring stability and reference tracking in the resulting NN-based closed-loop system requires modifications to the primary optimization problem. These modifications often introduce non-convexity and nonlinearity with respect to the decision variables, which may surpass the capabilities of existing solvers and complicate the generation of the training dataset. To address this issue, this paper develops a Neural Optimization Machine (NOM) to solve the resulting optimization problems. The central concept of a NOM is to transform the optimization challenges into the problem of training a NN. Rigorous proofs demonstrate that when a NN trained on data generated by the NOM is used in the control loop, all signals remain bounded and the system states asymptotically converge to a neighborhood around the desired equilibrium point, with a tunable proximity threshold. Simulation and experimental studies are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>On Min-Max Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control Considering Non-Unique Solutions to Behavioral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct data-driven control methods are known to be vulnerable to uncertainty in stochastic systems. In this paper, we propose a new robust data-driven predictive control (DDPC) framework to tackle the uncertainty in dynamic systems. By analyzing non-unique solutions to behavioral representation, we first shed light on the lack of robustness in subspace predictive control (SPC) as well as the projection-based regularized DDPC. This inspires us to construct an uncertainty set that includes admissible output trajectories deviating to some extent from nominal predictions from the subspace predictor and develop a min-max robust formulation of DDPC that endows control sequences with robustness against such unknown deviations. We establish its performance guarantees under bounded additive noise and develop convex reformulations of the min-max problem with moderate complexity. To mitigate the conservatism of robust design, an adaptive robust DDPC scheme is further proposed by incorporating an affine feedback policy, with performance guarantees and tractable reformulations derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed method effectively robustifies SPC and outperforms projection-based regularizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty of assessing the state lies in a little predictable change in the dimension of a dynamic system under the influence of internal changes and environmental parameters. In the work, the state of such a system is estimated by the method of integral indicators. The application of the method of integral indicators allowed us to evaluate the activity of an enterprise. In the present work, the method of integrated indicators is used to assess the control of a digital copy (enterprise).</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Data-Driven Algorithm for Continuous-Time Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presented is an algorithm to synthesize an infinite-horizon LQR optimal feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics, but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of (possibly suboptimal) input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along an arbitrary trajectory. This paper presents the derivation as well as shows examples applied to both linear and nonlinear systems inspired by air vehicles.</description>

      <title>Computationally Faster Newton Methods by Lazy Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies second-order optimization methods solving monotone nonlinear equation problems (MNE) and minimization problems (Min) in a $d$ dimensional vector space $\mathbb{R}^d$. In their seminal work, Monteiro and Svaiter (SIOPT 2012, 2013) proposed the Newton Proximal Extragradient (NPE) for MNE and its accelerated variation (A-NPE) for Min to find an $\epsilon$ solution to problems in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-{2}/{3}})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-{2}/{7}})$ iterations, respectively. In subsequent work, it was proved that these results are (near)-optimal and match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. However, the existing lower bound only applies to algorithms that query gradients and Hessians simultaneously. This paper improves the computational cost of Monteiro and Svaiter's methods by reusing Hessian across iterations. We propose the Lazy Extra Newton (LEN) method for MNE and its acceleration (A-LEN) for Min. The computational complexity bounds of our proposed methods match the optimal second-order methods in $\epsilon$ while reducing their dependency on the dimension by a factor of $d^{{(\omega-2)}/{3}}$ and $d^{{2(\omega-2)}/{7}}$ for MNE and Min, respectively, where $d^\omega$ is the computation complexity to solve the matrix inverse. We further generalize these methods to the strongly monotone cases and show that similar improvements still hold by using the restart strategy.</description>

      <title>Feasible Path SQP Algorithm for Simulation-based Optimization Surrogated with Differentiable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, simulation-based optimization problems, which present a significant challenge in the process systems engineering community, are increasingly being addressed with the surrogate-based framework. In this work, we propose a deterministic algorithm framework based on feasible path sequential quadratic programming for optimizing differentiable machine learning models embedded problems. The proposed framework effectively addresses two key challenges: (i) achieving the computation of first- and second-order derivatives of machine learning models' outputs with respect to inputs; and (ii) by introducing the feasible path method, the massive intermediate variables resulting from the algebraic formulation of machine learning models eliminated. Surrogate models for six test functions and two process simulations were established and optimized. All six test functions were successfully optimized to the global optima, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness. The optimization time for all cases did not exceed 2s, highlighting the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Kernelized Operator Approach to Nonlinear Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the design of nonlinear data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) using kernel functions. Compared with existing methods that use kernels to parameterize multi-step predictors for nonlinear DeePC, we adopt a novel, operator-based approach. More specifically, we employ a universal product kernel parameterization of nonlinear systems operators as a prediction mechanism for nonlinear DeePC. We show that by using a product reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to learn the system trajectories, big data sets can be handled effectively to construct the corresponding product Gram matrix. Moreover, we show that the structure of the adopted product RKHS representation allows for a computationally efficient DeePC formulation. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieves substantially faster computation times for the same data size. This allows for the use of much larger data sets and enhanced control performance.</description>

      <title>Inertial Bregman Proximal Gradient under Partial Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers an Inertial version of Bregman Proximal Gradient algorithm (IBPG) for minimizing the sum of two single-valued functions in finite dimension. We suppose that one of the functions is proper, closed, and convex but non-necessarily smooth whilst the second is a smooth enough function but not necessarily convex. For the latter, we ask the smooth adaptable property (smad) with respect to some kernel or entropy which allows to remove the very popular global Lipschitz continuity requirement on the gradient of the smooth part. We consider the IBPG under the framework of the triangle scaling property (TSP) which is a geometrical property for which one can provably ensure acceleration for a certain subset of kernel/entropy functions in the convex setting. Based on this property, we provide global convergence guarantees when the entropy is strongly convex under the framework of the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) property. Turning to the local convergence properties, we show that when the nonsmooth part is partly smooth relative to a smooth submanifold, IBPG has a finite activity identification property before entering a local linear convergence regime for which we establish a sharp estimate of the convergence rate. We report numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results on low complexity regularized phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>On the Singular Control of a Diffusion and Its Running Infimum or Supremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of singular stochastic control problems for a one-dimensional diffusion $X$ in which the performance criterion to be optimised depends explicitly on the running infimum $I$ (or supremum $S$) of the controlled process. We introduce two novel integral operators that are consistent with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the resulting two-dimensional singular control problems. The first operator involves integrals where the integrator is the control process of the two-dimensional process $(X,I)$ or $(X,S)$; the second operator concerns integrals where the integrator is the running infimum or supremum process itself. Using these definitions, we prove a general verification theorem for problems involving two-dimensional state-dependent running costs, costs of controlling the process, costs of increasing the running infimum (or supremum) and exit times. Finally, we apply our results to explicitly solve an optimal dividend problem in which the manager's time-preferences depend on the company's historical worst performance.</description>

      <title>A modified Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Application in Symbolic Optimal Control and Plan and Goal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contributions of this short technical note are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a modified version of a generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm calculating the value function of optimal control problems defined on hyper-graphs. Those Bellman-Ford algorithms can be used in particular for the synthesis of near-optimal controllers by the principle of symbolic control. Our modification causes less nodes of the hyper-graph being iterated during the execution compared to our initial version of the algorithm published in 2020. Our second contribution lies in the field of Plan recognition applied to drone missions driven by symbolic controllers. We address and resolve the Plan and Goal Recognition monitor's dependence on a pre-defined initial guess for a drone's task allocation and mission execution. To validate the enhanced implementation, we use a more challenging scenario for UAV-based aerial firefighting, demonstrating the practical applicability and robustness of the system architecture.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Fractional Evolution Equations with Nonlocal Conditions via Operator Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, as well as the approximate controllability, of a class of fractional evolution equations with nonlocal conditions in Hilbert spaces. Sufficient conditions for approximate controllability are established through a novel approach to the approximate solvability of semilinear operator equations. The methodology utilizes Green's function and constructs a control function based on the Gramian controllability operator. The analysis is based on Schauder's fixed point theorem and the theory of fractional order solution operators and resolvent operators. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed theoretical results, an illustrative example is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an approach to studying optimal control problems in the space of nonnegative measures with dynamics given by a nonlocal balance law. This approach relies on transforming the balance law into a continuity equation in the space of probabilities, and subsequently into an ODE in a Hilbert space. The main result is a version of Pontryagin's maximum principle for the addressed problem, which encompasses all known formulations of this type in mean field control theory.</description>

      <title>A note on the Cucker-Smale model with time delay and communication failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a Cucker-Smale model with time-dependent time delay and communication failures. Namely, we investigate the situation in which the agents involved in a flocking process can eventually suspend the exchange of information among themselves at some times. Under a so-called Persistence Excitation Condition, we establish the exponential flocking for the considered model. The exponential decay estimates on the velocity diameters we obtain are independent of the number of agents, which is convenient especially when the number of agents becomes too large. Exponential decay estimates with decay rate depending on the number of agents appear instead in the case of pair-dependent time delays and non-universal interaction, i.e. not all the agents are able to exchange information among themselves. In this paper, we rather consider a universal interaction and the time delay functions do not depend on the pair of agents. The analysis is then extended to a model with distributed time delay, namely the time delay is not pointwise but the agents are influenced by the information received from the other components of the system in a certain time interval.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Optimization Method for Blind Extraction of External Equitable Partitions from Low Pass Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeking the external equitable partitions (EEPs) of networks under unknown structures is an emerging problem in network analysis. The special structure of EEPs has found widespread applications in many fields such as cluster synchronization and consensus dynamics. While most literature focuses on utilizing the special structural properties of EEPs for network studies, there has been little work on the extraction of EEPs or their connection with graph signals. In this paper, we address the interesting connection between low pass graph signals and EEPs, which, as far as we know, is the first time. We provide a method BE-EEPs for extracting EEPs from low pass graph signals and propose an optimization model, which is essentially a problem involving nonnegative orthogonality matrix decomposition. We derive theoretical error bounds for the performance of our proposed method under certain assumptions and apply three algorithms to solve the resulting model, including the K-means algorithm, the practical exact penalty method and the iterative Lagrangian approach. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Under strong low pass graph signals, the iterative Lagrangian and K-means perform equally well, outperforming the exact penalty method.

      <description>arXiv:2501.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gradient-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve high-dimensional, finite-horizon stochastic control problems. Although the recently developed deep reinforcement learning framework has achieved great success in solving these problems, direct estimation of policy gradients from Monte Carlo sampling often suffers from high variance. To address this, we introduce the Momentum Consensus-Based Optimization (M-CBO) and Adaptive Momentum Consensus-Based Optimization (Adam-CBO) frameworks. These methods optimize policies using Monte Carlo estimates of the value function, rather than its gradients. Adjustable Gaussian noise supports efficient exploration, helping the algorithm converge to optimal policies in complex, nonconvex environments. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and scalability of our approach across various problem dimensions and show the potential for extension to mean-field control problems. Theoretically, we prove that M-CBO can converge to the optimal policy under some assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PIETOOLS 2024 User Manual describes all the features of version 2024 of the MATLAB toolbox PIETOOLS for the analysis and control of Partial Integral Equations (PIEs). The manual is aimed to guide, with examples, first-time users to four fundamental features of PIETOOLS: converting coupled ODE-PDEs, DDEs, DDFs, etc., to PIE representation; analysis of stability and input-output properties of PIEs; design of optimal observers and controllers for PIEs; simulation of open- and closed-loop PIE systems. The use of PIETOOLS is not limited to the features described above. However, the manual focuses on these features to provide a holistic understanding of the workflow of PIETOOLS, which will serve as a foundation to develop more complicated programs, for example, the design of boundary feedback controllers, robust observers, robust controllers, etc..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-model particle filters such as the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter require a resampling procedure in order to converge to exact Bayesian inference. Canonically, stochastic resampling is performed, which provides useful samples with no guarantee of usefulness for a finite ensemble. We propose a new resampling procedure based on optimal transport that deterministically selects optimal resampling points. We show on a toy 3-variable problem that it significantly reduces the amount of particles required for useful state estimation. Finally, we show that this filter improves the state estimation of a seldomly-observed space object in an NRHO around the moon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17349v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical function optimization framework designed for constrained optimization problems in robotics. The tool is designed with real-time considerations and is suitable for online trajectory and control input optimization problems. The proposed framework does not require any analytical representation of the problem and works with constrained block-box optimization functions. The method combines first-order gradient-based line search algorithms with constraint prioritization through nullspace projections onto constraint Jacobian space. The tool is implemented in C++ and provided online for community use, along with some numerical and robotic example implementations presented in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical control scheme for large-scale systems whose components can exchange information through a data network. The main goal of the supervisory layer is to find the best compromise between control performance and communicational costs by actively modifying the network topology. The actions taken at the supervisory layer alter the control agents' knowledge of the complete system, and the set of agents with which they can communicate. Each group of linked subsystems, or coalition, is independently controlled based on a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme, managed at the bottom layer. Hard constraints on the inputs are imposed, while soft constraints on the states are considered to avoid feasibility issues. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated on a model of the Dez irrigation canal, implemented on the accurate simulator for water systems SOBEK. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained using a centralized MPC controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of information and communication technologies has yielded the means of sharing measurements and other information in an efficient and flexible way, which has enabled the size and complexity of control applications to increase. At the same time, the improvements in the computational and communicational capabilities of control devices have fostered the development of noncentralized control architectures, already motivated by the inherent structural constraints of large-scale systems. Computer-based control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) are visible beneficiaries of these advances and have registered a significant growth regarding both theoretical and applied fields. Coalitional control focuses on the local interests that motivate the controllers to assemble, an aspect so far rarely contemplated in the distributed control literature. This article presents the main concepts and challenges in coalitional control, and the links with cooperative network game theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent major developments in information technologies have opened interesting possibilities for the effective management of multi-agent systems. In many cases, the important role of central control nodes can now be undertaken by several controllers in a distributed topology that suits better the structure of the system. This opens as well the possibility to promote cooperation between control agents in competitive environments, establishing links between controllers in order to adapt the exchange of critical information to the degree of subsystems' interactions. In this paper a bottom-up approach to coalitional control is presented, where the structure of each agent's model predictive controller is adapted to the time-variant coupling conditions, promoting the formation of coalitions - clusters of control agents where communication is essential to ensure the cooperation - whenever it can bring benefit to the overall system performance.</description>

Abstract: Two classes of algorithms for optimization in the presence of noise are presented, that do not require the evaluation of the objective function. The first generalizes the well-known Adagrad method. Its complexity is then analyzed as a function of its parameters. A second class of algorithms is then derived whose complexity is at least as good as that of the first class. Initial numerical experiments on finite-sum problems arising from deep-learning applications suggest that methods of the second class may outperform those of the first.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework that unifies different fairness measures into a general, parameterized class of convex fairness measures suitable for optimization contexts. First, we propose a new class of order-based fairness measures, discuss their properties, and derive an axiomatic characterization for such measures. Then, we introduce the class of convex fairness measures, discuss their properties, and derive an equivalent dual representation of these measures as a robustified order-based fairness measure over their dual sets. Importantly, this dual representation renders a unified mathematical expression and an alternative geometric characterization for convex fairness measures through their dual sets. Moreover, it allows us to develop a unified framework for optimization problems with a convex fairness measure objective or constraint, including unified reformulations and solution methods. In addition, we provide stability results that quantify the impact of employing different convex fairness measures on the optimal value and solution of the resulting fairness-promoting optimization problem. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the computational efficiency of our unified framework over traditional ones and illustrating our stability results.</description>

      <title>On graphs with finite-time consensus and their use in gradient tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies sequences of graphs satisfying the finite-time consensus property (i.e., iterating through such a finite sequence is equivalent to performing global or exact averaging) and their use in Gradient Tracking. We provide an explicit weight matrix representation of the studied sequences and prove their finite-time consensus property. Moreover, we incorporate the studied finite-time consensus topologies into Gradient Tracking and present a new algorithmic scheme called Gradient Tracking for Finite-Time Consensus Topologies (GT-FT). We analyze the new scheme for nonconvex problems with stochastic gradient estimates. Our analysis shows that the convergence rate of GT-FT does not depend on the heterogeneity of the agents' functions or the connectivity of any individual graph in the topology sequence. Furthermore, owing to the sparsity of the graphs, GT-FT requires lower communication costs than Gradient Tracking using the static counterpart of the topology sequence.</description>

      <title>Multimodal urban transportation network equilibrium including intermodality and shared mobility services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared Mobility Services (SMSs) are reshaping urban transportation systems by providing flexible mobility options. With their ability to decrease the number of cars on the roads, these services can potentially improve the transportation system's performance in terms of travel times and emissions. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing and understanding their impacts on the system and users' choices, especially when integrated into a complex multi-modal system, including public transport (PT). Many studies overlook the synergies between SMSs and PT, leading to inaccurate traffic estimations and planning. This research offers an extensive review of multi-modal transportation system models involving SMSs. We then introduce a traffic assignment analytical model valid in both continuous and integer settings, leading to a Mixed-Integer Bilinear Programming (MIBLP) formulation. This model comprises diverse travel possibilities, including SMSs, and handles intermodality by allowing commuters to combine modes to optimize time and monetary expense. An in-depth examination of commuters' mode and path choices on two test cases and an analysis of the price of anarchy highlights the disparities between user equilibrium and system optimum in such intricate systems.</description>

      <title>AGDA+: Proximal Alternating Gradient Descent Ascent Method with a Nonmonotone Adaptive Step-Size Search for Nonconvex Minimax Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider double-regularized nonconvex-strongly concave (NCSC) minimax problems of the form $(P):\min_{x\in\mathcal{X}} \max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}g(x)+f(x,y)-h(y)$, where $g$, $h$ are closed convex, $f$ is $L$-smooth in $(x,y)$ and strongly concave in $y$. We propose a proximal alternating gradient descent ascent method AGDA+ that can adaptively choose nonmonotone primal-dual stepsizes to compute an approximate stationary point for $(P)$ without requiring the knowledge of the global Lipschitz constant $L$ and the concavity modulus $\mu$. Using a nonmonotone step-size search (backtracking) scheme, AGDA+ stands out by its ability to exploit the local Lipschitz structure and eliminates the need for precise tuning of hyper-parameters. AGDA+ achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and it is the first step-size search method for NCSC minimax problems that require only $3$ calls to $\nabla f$ on average per backtracking iteration. The numerical experiments demonstrate its robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factor Analysis is a widely used modeling technique for stationary time series which achieves dimensionality reduction by revealing a hidden low-rank plus sparse structure of the covariance matrix. Such an idea of parsimonious modeling has also been important in the field of systems and control. In this article, a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem involving the $\ell_0$ norm is constructed in order to achieve the low-rank and sparse additive decomposition of the sample covariance matrix. We establish the existence of an optimal solution and characterize these solutions via the concept of proximal stationary points. Furthermore, an ADMM algorithm is designed to solve the $\ell_0$ optimization problem, and a subsequence convergence result is proved under reasonable assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with some alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are powerful tools for approximating the log-density functions in high-dimensional spaces along trajectories, where neural networks parameterize the velocity fields. This paper proposes a system of neural differential equations representing first- and second-order score functions along trajectories based on deep neural networks. We reformulate the mean field control (MFC) problem with individual noises into an unconstrained optimization problem framed by the proposed neural ODE system. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization term to enforce characteristics of viscous Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations to be satisfied based on the evolution of the second-order score function. Examples include regularized Wasserstein proximal operators (RWPOs), probability flow matching of Fokker--Planck (FP) equations, and linear quadratic (LQ) MFC problems, which demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximate controllability of bilinear Schr\"odinger equations and diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger PDEs, posed on a boundaryless Riemannian manifold $M$, with bilinear control. We propose a new method to prove the global $L^2$-approximate controllability. Contrarily to previous ones, it works in arbitrarily small time and does not require a discrete spectrum.
  This approach consists in controlling separately the radial part and the angular part of the wavefunction thanks to the control of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$ and the control of phases, which refer to the possibility, for any initial state $\psi_0\in L^2(M,\mathbb{C})$, diffeomorphism $P\in {\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ and phase $\varphi \in L^2(M,\mathbb{R})$ to reach approximately the states $(\det DP)^{1/2}(\psi_0\circ P)$ and $e^{i \varphi}\psi_0 $. The control of the radial part uses the transitivity of the group action of ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ on positive densities proved by Moser.
  We develop this approach on two examples of Schr\"odinger equations, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$, for which the small-time control of phases was recently proved. We prove that it implies the small-time control of flows of vector fields thanks to Lie bracket techniques. Combining this property with the simplicity of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ proved by Thurston, we obtain the control of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-timescale gradient descent-ascent (GDA) is a canonical gradient algorithm designed to find Nash equilibria in min-max games. We analyze the two-timescale GDA by investigating the effects of learning rate ratios on convergence behavior in both finite-dimensional and mean-field settings. In particular, for finite-dimensional quadratic min-max games, we obtain long-time convergence in near quasi-static regimes through the hypocoercivity method. For mean-field GDA dynamics, we investigate convergence under a finite-scale ratio using a mixed synchronous-reflection coupling technique.</description>

      <title>Solve the General Constrained Optimal Control Problem with Common Integration Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.02140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation of general state- and/or control-constrained Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) is difficult for various constraints, especially the intractable path constraint. For such problems, the theoretical convergence of numerical algorithms is usually not guaranteed, and the right solution may not be successfully obtained. With the recently proposed Variation Evolving Method (VEM), the evolution equations, which guarantee the convergence towards the optimal solution in theory even for the general constrained OCPs, are derived. In particular, the costate-free optimality conditions are established. Besides the analytic expressions of the costates and the Lagrange multipliers adjoining the terminal constraint, the integral equation that determines the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multiplier variable is also derived. Upon the work in this paper, the general constrained OCPs may be transformed to the Initial-value Problems (IVPs) to be solved, with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical integration methods.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of a discretization of dynamic optimal transport using the dual formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a discretization of the dynamic optimal transport problem for which we can obtain the convergence rate for the value of the transport cost to its continuous value when the temporal and spatial stepsize vanish. This convergence result does not require any regularity assumption on the measures, though experiments suggest that the rate is not sharp. Via an analysis of the duality gap we also obtain the convergence rates for the gradient of the optimal potentials and the velocity field under mild regularity assumptions. To obtain such rates, we discretize the dual formulation of the dynamic optimal transport problem and use the mature literature related to the error due to discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Optimization of Dynamic Networks for Reduction of Vulnerability Against Adversarial Resonance Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance is a well-known phenomenon that happens in systems with second order dynamics. In this paper we address the fundamental question of making a network robust to signal being periodically pumped into it at or near a resonant frequency by an adversarial agent with the aim of saturating the network with the signal. Towards this goal, we develop the notion of network vulnerability, which is measured by the expected resonance amplitude on the network under a stochastically modeled adversarial attack. Assuming a second order dynamics model based on the network graph Laplacian matrix and a known stochastic model for the adversarial attack, we propose two methods for minimizing the network vulnerability through optimization of the spectrum of the network graph. We provide extensive numerical results analyzing the effects of both methods.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Get Rich: Approximation and Dynamics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning capabilities, yet the theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. A recent work (Elhage et al., 2021) identified a ``rich'' in-context mechanism known as induction head, contrasting with ``lazy'' $n$-gram models that overlook long-range dependencies. In this work, we provide both approximation and dynamics analyses of how transformers implement induction heads. In the {\em approximation} analysis, we formalize both standard and generalized induction head mechanisms, and examine how transformers can efficiently implement them, with an emphasis on the distinct role of each transformer submodule. For the {\em dynamics} analysis, we study the training dynamics on a synthetic mixed target, composed of a 4-gram and an in-context 2-gram component. This controlled setting allows us to precisely characterize the entire training process and uncover an {\em abrupt transition} from lazy (4-gram) to rich (induction head) mechanisms as training progresses.</description>
