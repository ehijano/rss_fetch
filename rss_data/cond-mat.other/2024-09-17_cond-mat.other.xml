      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, systematic characterization of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold exceptional points (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize Abelian topology of eigenvalues for generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by these resultants. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems of both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective method for predicting chaotic systems by using a high-dimensional dynamic reservoir with fixed internal weights, while keeping the learning phase linear, which simplifies training and reduces computational complexity compared to fully trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) uses the exponential growth of Hilbert spaces in quantum systems, allowing for greater information processing, memory capacity, and computational power. However, the original QRC proposal requires coherent injection of inputs multiple times, complicating practical implementation. We present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that implements memory through classical post-processing of quantum measurements. This approach avoids the need for multiple coherent input injections and is evaluated on benchmark tasks, including the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series prediction. We tested our model on two physical platforms: a fully connected Ising model and a Rydberg atom array. The optimized model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, achieving a higher number of steps compared to previously reported approaches.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic spintronics combines two advanced fields in technology, neuromorphic computing and spintronics, to create brain-inspired, efficient computing systems that leverage the unique properties of the electron's spin. In this book chapter, we first introduce both fields - neuromorphic computing and spintronics and then make a case for neuromorphic spintronics. We discuss concrete examples of neuromorphic spintronics, including computing based on fluctuations, artificial neural networks, and reservoir computing, highlighting their potential to revolutionize computational efficiency and functionality.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non-Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of surface-selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non-Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, surface-projected density functional theory calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc connectivity and generates new isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the surface-selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk--non-Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non-Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non-Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>
