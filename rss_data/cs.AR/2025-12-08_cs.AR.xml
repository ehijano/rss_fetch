      <title>ARCAS: An Augmented Reality Collision Avoidance System with SLAM-Based Tracking for Enhancing VRU Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360-degree 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubled pedestrians' time-to-collision and increased counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided-eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next-generation safety tool for urban mobility.</description>

      <title>When Forgetting Builds Reliability: LLM Unlearning for Reliable Hardware Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in accelerating digital hardware design through automated code generation. Yet, ensuring their reliability remains a critical challenge, as existing LLMs trained on massive heterogeneous datasets often exhibit problematic memorization of proprietary intellectual property (IP), contaminated benchmarks, and unsafe coding patterns. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes. Our work paves an avenue towards reliable LLM-assisted hardware design.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Second-order Training of Deep Neural Networks with In-memory Analog Matrix Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimization methods, which leverage curvature information, offer faster and more stable convergence than first-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam. However, their practical adoption is hindered by the prohibitively high cost of inverting the second-order information matrix, particularly in large-scale neural network training. Here, we present the first demonstration of a second-order optimizer powered by in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) using resistive random-access memory (RRAM), which performs matrix inversion (INV) in a single step. We validate the optimizer by training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten letter classification, achieving 26% and 61% fewer training epochs than SGD with momentum and Adam, respectively. On a larger task using the same second-order method, our system delivers a 5.88x improvement in throughput and a 6.9x gain in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of AMC circuits for second-order neural network training, opening a new path toward energy-efficient AI acceleration.</description>

      <title>ChipMind: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Long-Context Circuit Design Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate immense potential for automating integrated circuit (IC) development, their practical deployment is fundamentally limited by restricted context windows. Existing context-extension methods struggle to achieve effective semantic modeling and thorough multi-hop reasoning over extensive, intricate circuit specifications. To address this, we introduce ChipMind, a novel knowledge graph-augmented reasoning framework specifically designed for lengthy IC specifications. ChipMind first transforms circuit specifications into a domain-specific knowledge graph ChipKG through the Circuit Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Construction methodology. It then leverages the ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning mechanism, combining information-theoretic adaptive retrieval to dynamically trace logical dependencies with intent-aware semantic filtering to prune irrelevant noise, effectively balancing retrieval completeness and precision. Evaluated on an industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmark, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%). Our framework bridges a critical gap between academic research and practical industrial deployment of LLM-aided Hardware Design (LAD).</description>

      <title>Orders in Chaos: Enhancing Large-Scale MoE LLM Serving with Data Movement Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently become the frontier open weight models, achieving remarkable model capability similar to proprietary ones. But their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit LLM serving systems.
  To understand the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across four state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models released in 2025 (200B-1000B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. We perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. With our insights, we then demonstrate how to improve wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, and show that minor architectural modifications leveraging the insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 5.3x and 3.1x average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work presents the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of large-scale MoE models and a concrete design study using the learned lessons, with profiling traces and simulation framework already open-sourced with $&gt;$1k downloads. Our traces and results are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/core12345/MoE_expert_selection_trace</description>

      <title>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ can achieve remarkably high encoding rates (about 30% and 20% at concatenation levels 3 and 4, respectively), they have large code block sizes at high levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates per block high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we comprehensively investigate smaller many-hypercube codes with $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a notable fact that $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</description>
