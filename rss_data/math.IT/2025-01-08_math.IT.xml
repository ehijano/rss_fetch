      <title>Feasibility of short blocklength Reed-Muller codes for coset coding over real environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of Reed-Muller (RM) codes for Physical-layer security in a real world wiretap channel scenario. Utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs) in a real indoor environment, we implement a coset coding scheme that leverages the hierarchical structure of RM codes to secure data transmission. The generator matrix of the RM code is used to partition codewords into cosets in the usual way, where each message corresponds to a unique coset, and auxiliary bits select specific codewords within each coset. This approach enables the legitimate receiver (Bob) can decode the transmitted message with minimal bit error rate (BER), while an eavesdropper (Eve) experiences a high BER, thus protecting the confidentiality of the communication. Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) is employed to quantify the information leakage and validate the effectiveness of the scheme. Experimental results indicate that RM codes can achieve robust security even in practical environments affected by real-world channel impairments. These findings demonstrate the potential of RM codes as an efficient solution for physical-layer security, particularly for applications that require low latency and short blocklengths.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e Lower Bound Approach for Performance Trade-offs in MIMO ISAC Systems with Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the performance trade-offs between sensing and communication subsystems is essential for enabling integrated sensing and communication systems. Various metrics exist for each subsystem; however, this study focuses on the ergodic capacity of the communication subsystem. Due to the complexity of deriving the sensing mean square error (MSE) and the inapplicability of the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound to channels with discrete or mixed distributions, this work proposes a Poincar\'e lower bound on the sensing MSE to address these issues. An achievable inner bound for the rate-sensing trade-off in a fading multiple-input multiple-output channel with additive white Gaussian noise and blockage probability is established. In addition, a strategy that is asymptotically optimal for sensing is provided.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal cyclic orbit codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on two aspects of cyclic orbit codes: invariants under equivalence and quasi-optimality. Regarding the first aspect, we establish a connection between the codewords of a cyclic orbit code and a certain linear set on the projective line. This allows us to derive new bounds on the parameters of the code. In the second part, we study a particular family of (quasi-)optimal cyclic orbit codes and derive a general existence theorem for quasi-optimal codes in even-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of any characteristic. Finally, for our particular code family we describe the automorphism groups under the general linear group and a suitable Galois group.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction for Single-Deletion Single-Substitution Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central problem in sequence reconstruction is to find the minimum number of distinct channel outputs required to uniquely reconstruct the transmitted sequence. According to Levenshtein's work in 2001, this number is determined by the maximum size of the intersection between the error balls of any two distinct input sequences of the channel. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for single-deletion single-substitution channel, assuming that the transmitted sequence belongs to a $q$-ary code with minimum Hamming distance at least $2$, where $q\geq 2$ is any fixed integer. Specifically, we prove that for any two $q$-ary sequences with Hamming distance $d\geq 2$, the size of the intersection of their error balls is upper bounded by $2qn-3q-2-\delta_{q,2}$, where $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta. We also prove the tightness of this bound by constructing two sequences the intersection size of whose error balls achieves this bound.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding based on Skew Polynomials and Multivariate Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation considers new constructions and decoding approaches for error-correcting codes based on non-conventional polynomials, with the objective of providing new coding solutions to the applications mentioned above. With skew polynomials, we construct codes that are dual-containing, which is a desired property of quantum error-correcting codes. By considering evaluation codes based on skew polynomials, a condition on the existence of optimal support-constrained codes is derived and an application of such codes in the distributed multi-source networks is proposed. For a class of multicast networks, the advantage of vector network coding compared to scalar network coding is investigated. Multivariate polynomials have been attracting increasing interest in constructing codes with repair capabilities by accessing only a small amount of available symbols, which is required to build failure-resistant distributed storage systems. A new class of bivariate evaluation codes and their local recovery capability are studied. Interestingly, the well-known Reed-Solomon codes are used in a class of locally recoverable codes with availability (multiple disjoint recovery sets) via subspace design. Aside from new constructions, decoding approaches are considered in order to increase the error correction capability in the case where the code is fixed. In particular, new lower and upper bounds on the success probability of joint decoding interleaved alternant codes by a syndrome-based decoder are derived, where alternant codes are an important class of algebraic codes containing Goppa codes, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes as sub-classes.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Equal-Difference Structure of Cyclotomic Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we represent an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</description>

      <title>Some properties and applications of the new quantum $f$-divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new definition for quantum $f$-divergences was introduced based on an integral representation. These divergences have shown remarkable properties, for example when investigating contraction coefficients under noisy channels. At the same time, many properties well known for other definitions have remained elusive for the new quantum $f$-divergence because of its unusual representation. In this work, we investigate alternative ways of expressing these quantum $f$-divergences. We leverage these expressions to prove new properties of these $f$-divergences and demonstrate some applications. In particular, we give a new proof of the achievability of the quantum Chernoff bound by establishing a strengthening of an inequality by Audenaert et al. We also establish inequalities between some previously known Renyi divergences and the new Renyi divergence. We further investigate some monotonicity and convexity properties of the new $f$-divergences, and prove inequalities between these divergences for various functions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study algebraic decompositions and secondary constructions of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions. In many cases, we establish precise criteria which characterize when certain modifications of a given APN function yield new ones. Furthermore, we show that some of the newly constructed functions are extended-affine inequivalent to the original ones.</description>

      <title>RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.</description>

      <title>Markov Insertion/Deletion Channels: Information Stability and Capacity Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channels with synchronization errors modeled as insertions and deletions. A classical result for such channels is their information stability, hence the existence of the Shannon capacity, when the synchronization errors are memoryless. In this paper, we extend this result to the case where the insertions and deletions have memory. Specifically, we assume that the synchronization errors are governed by a stationary and ergodic finite state Markov chain, and prove that such channel is information-stable, which implies the existence of a coding scheme which achieves the limit of mutual information. This result implies the existence of the Shannon capacity for a wide range of channels with synchronization errors, with different applications including DNA storage. The methods developed may also be useful to prove other coding theorems for non-trivial channel sequences.</description>

      <title>Approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances between parametric statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) and movable antenna (MA) have recently emerged as promising technologies to exploit new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), which have attracted growing attention in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a recent channel model of a nanopore sequencer proposed by McBain, Viterbo, and Saunderson (2024), termed the noisy nanopore channel (NNC). In essence, an NNC is a noisy duplication channel, whose input source has a specific Markov structure. We present bounds on the channel capacity of selected NNCs, via simple information-theoretic inequalities. In particular, we provide a (tight) lower bound on the capacity of the noiseless NCC and demonstrate that for an NNC with erasure noise, the capacity approaches $1$ for nanopore memories that scale roughly logarithmically in the length of the input sequence.</description>

      <title>Achieving Distributed MIMO Performance with Repeater-Assisted Cellular Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In what ways could cellular massive MIMO be improved? This technology has already been shown to bring huge performance gains. However, coverage holes and difficulties to transmit multiple streams to multi-antenna users because of insufficient channel rank remain issues. Distributed MIMO, also known as cell-free massive MIMO, might be the ultimate solution. However, while being a powerful technology, it is expensive to install backhaul, and it is a difficult problem to achieve accurate phase alignment for coherent multi-user beamforming on downlink. Another option is reflective intelligent surfaces - but they have large form factors and require a lot of training and control overhead, and probably, in practice, some form of active filtering to make them sufficiently band-selective.
  We propose a new approach to densification of cellular systems, envisioning repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO, where a large numbers of physically small and cheap wireless repeaters are deployed. They receive and retransmit signals instantaneously, appearing as active scatterers. Meaning that they appear as ordinary channel scatterers but with amplification. We elaborate on the requirements of such repeaters, show that the performance of these systems could potentially approach that of distributed MIMO, and outline future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.</description>
