      <title>A Probability Space at Inception of Stochastic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, progress has been made in the theory of turbulence, which provides a framework on how a deterministic process changes to a stochastic one owing to the change in thermodynamic states. It is well known that, in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to periodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and subject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow, solid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these physical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own probability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In particular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process with the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic process was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the dissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic probability density function with the negative probability regimes. In addition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability density function along both the positive and negative axes with slight asymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1, we can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent benefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function. Moreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system and the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the establishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative dynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools available and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability density function can provide a convenient platform for the development of statistics.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Identifying Weakly Chaotic, Strongly Chaotic, Resonant and Non-resonant Orbits in the Generalized Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21318v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the types of orbits is an important topic in the study of chaotic dynamical systems. Beyond the well-known distinctly chaotic and regular motions, we focus on dynamics occurring in regions where regular and chaotic motions coexist and intertwine, which potentially indicating weakly chaotic orbits. This intermediate regime lies between strongly chaotic dynamics, characterized by exponential sensitivity and completely non-chaotic, purely regular behavior. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to identify the types of orbits in the generalized kicked rotator system, which is challenging to study due to its complex and mixed chaotic behaviors. Our deep learning framework can be divided into two steps. First, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates the weighted Birkhoff average, the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension to identify weakly chaotic orbits. The algorithm categorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and regular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant orbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models. Second, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in accurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D structural information of the phase space relation. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify weakly chaotic orbits using deep learning methods. The method can be easily extend to other models.</description>

      <title>The local Gaussian correlation networks among return tails in the Chinese stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation. The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality, average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the local Gaussian correlation method.</description>

      <title>Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity. We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and Intermittency in Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of complex dynamics in a system of coupled dissipative kicked rotors and show that critical transitions can be understood via bifurcations of simple states. We study multistability and bifurcations in the single rotor model, demonstrating how these give rise to a variety of coexisting spatial patterns in a coupled system. A combined order parameter is introduced to characterize different spatial patterns and to reveal the coexistence of chaotic and regular attractors. Finally, we illustrate an intermittent phenomenon near the onset of chaos.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>
