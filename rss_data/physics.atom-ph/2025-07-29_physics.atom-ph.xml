      <title>Probing transition rates, nuclear moments and electric dipole polarizability in nobelium using multireference FSRCC and PRCC theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an all-particle multireference Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster (FSRCC) theory to compute the ionization potential, excitation energy, transition rate and hyperfine structure constants associated with $7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^{3}P_{1}$ and $7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ transitions in nobelium (No). Using our state-of-the-art calculations in conjunction with available experimental data \cite{raeder-18}, we extract the values of nuclear magnetic dipole ($\mu$) and electric quadrupole ($Q$) moments for $^{253}$No. Further, information on nuclear deformation in even-mass isotopes is extracted from the isotope shift calculations. Moreover, we employ a perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster (PRCC) theory to compute the ground state electric dipole polarizability of No. In addition, to assess the accuracy of our calculations, we compute the ionization potential and dipole polarizability of lighter homolog ytterbium (Yb). To account for strong relativistic and quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects in No, we incorporate the corrections from Breit interaction, vacuum polarization and self-energy in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations in coupled-cluster is accounted perturbatively. Our calculations reveal a significant contribution of $\approx$10\% from the perturbative triples to the transition rate of $7s^2\;^1S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^3P_{1}$ transition. The largest cumulative contribution from Breit+QED is observed to be $\approx$4\%, to the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constant of $7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ state. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of atomic and nuclear properties of nobelium with valuable insights into the electron correlation and relativistic effects in superheavy elements.</description>

      <title>Fringe visibility and which-way information in Young's double slit experiments with light scattered from single atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young's double slit experiment has often been used to illustrate the concept of complementarity in quantum mechanics. If information can in principle be obtained about the path of the photon, then the visibility of the interference fringes is reduced or even destroyed. This Gedanken experiment discussed by Bohr and Einstein can be realized when the slit is replaced by individual atoms sensitive to the transferred recoil momentum of a photon which "passes through the slit". Early pioneering experiments were done with trapped ions and atom pairs created via photo-dissociation. Recently, it became possible to perform interference experiments with single neutral atoms cooled to the absolute ground state of a harmonic oscillator potential. The slits are now single atoms representing a two-level system, and the excitation in the harmonic oscillator potential is the which-way marker. In this note, we analyze and generalize two recent experiments performed with single atoms and emphasize the different ways they record which-way information.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Schiff moment of fluorine isotope $^{19}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear Schiff moments (NSMs) are sensitive probes for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, signaling violations of time-reversal and parity-inversion symmetries in atomic nuclei. In this Letter, we report the first-ever calculation of a NSM in a nuclear ab initio framework, employing the no-core shell model to study the fluorine isotope $^{19}$F. We further perform quantum-chemistry calculations to evaluate the sensitivity of the hafnium monofluoride cation, HfF$^+$, to the NSM of $^{19}$F. Combined with recent high-precision measurements of the molecular electric dipole moment of HfF$^+$, our results enable the first experimental bound on the NSM of $^{19}$F.</description>

      <title>Efficient construction of fault-tolerant neutral-atom cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are a useful resource in quantum computation, and can be generated by applying entangling gates between next-neighbor qubits. Heralded entangling gates offer the advantage of high post-selected fidelity, and can be used to create cluster states at the expense of large space-time overheads. We propose a low-overhead protocol to generate and merge high-fidelity many-atom entangled states into a 3D cluster state that supports fault-tolerant universal logical operations. Our simulations indicate that a state-of-the-art high-finesse optical cavity is sufficient for constructing a scalable fault-tolerant cluster state with loss and Pauli errors remaining an order of magnitude below their respective thresholds. This protocol reduces the space-time resource requirements for cluster state construction, highlighting the measurement-based method as an alternative approach to achieving large-scale error-corrected quantum processing with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of below-threshold harmonics in aligned molecules: a few-level model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the BTH regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks on Arbitrary Spatial Networks with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation, leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks, which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms, with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in spatial search algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Dual-Axis Atomic Interferometric Inertial Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interferometric inertial sensor that utilizes two counter-propagating atomic beams with transverse two-dimensional cooling. By employing three parallel and spatially aligned Raman laser beams for Doppler-sensitive Raman transitions, we successfully generate inertia-sensitive Mach-Zehnder interference fringes with an interrogation length of $2L=54\,\rm{cm}$. The sensor's capability to measure rotation and acceleration simultaneously in dynamic environments is validated through comparative analysis with classical sensors under force oscillation in different directions. Additionally, we conduct experiments on a turntable to calibrate the gyroscope's scaling factor and address nonlinearity. The angular random walk (ARW) and velocity random walk (VRW) of the senor are $3\times10^{-4}\,^\circ/\rm{\sqrt{h}}$ and $107\,\mathrm{\mu}g/\rm{\sqrt{Hz}}$, respectively, with the long-term stability reaching $9\times10^{-4}\,\rm{^\circ/h}$ for rotation and $10\,\rm{\mu g}$ for acceleration at an integration time of 1000s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the outer electron in an alkali atom in the presence of structured electromagnetic waves is described. The interaction of the alkali Rydberg atom with twisted radiowaves is considered. The two schemes for Rydberg-atom based detector of twisted radiowaves are proposed. According to the theoretical model for these detectors, they can record a source of twisted radiowaves with power down to several nW. The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit encoding in ytterbium-171 atoms for simulating 1+1D QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</description>
