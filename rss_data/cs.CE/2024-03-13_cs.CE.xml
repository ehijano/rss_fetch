      <title>Towards Full Automation of Geometry Extraction for Biomechanical Analysis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Neural Network-Based versus Classical Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigated the impact of image segmentation methods on the results of stress computation in the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We compared wall stress distributions and magnitudes calculated from geometry models obtained from classical semi-automated segmentation versus automated neural network-based segmentation. Ten different AAA contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images were semi-automatically segmented by an analyst, taking, depending on the quality of an image, between 15 and 40 minutes of human effort per patient. The same images were automatically segmented using PRAEVAorta 2, commercial software by NUREA (https://www.nurea-soft.com/), developed based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, requiring only 1-2 minutes of computer time per patient. Aneurysm wall stress calculations performed using the BioPARR software (https://bioparr.mech.uwa.edu.au/) revealed that, compared to the classical semi-automated segmentation, the automatic neural network-based segmentation leads to equivalent stress distributions, and slightly higher peak and 99th percentile maximum principal stress values. This difference is due to consistently larger lumen surface areas in automatically segmented models as compared to classical semi-automated segmentations, resulting in greater total pressure load on the wall. Our findings are a steppingstone toward a fully automated pipeline for biomechanical analysis of AAAs, starting with CT scans and concluding with wall stress assessment, while at the same time highlighting the critical importance of the repeatable and accurate segmentation of the lumen, the difficult problem often underestimated by the literature.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Pressure Management Strategies for Geological CO2 Sequestration Using Surrogate Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injecting greenhouse gas into deep underground reservoirs for permanent storage can inadvertently lead to fault reactivation, caprock fracturing and greenhouse gas leakage when the injection-induced stress exceeds the critical threshold. Extraction of pre-existing fluids at various stages of injection process, referred as pressure management, can mitigate associated risks and lessen environmental impact. However, identifying optimal pressure management strategies typically requires thousands of full-order simulations due to the need for function evaluations, making the process computationally prohibitive. This paper introduces a novel surrogate model-based reinforcement learning method for devising optimal pressure management strategies for geological CO2 sequestration efficiently. Our approach comprises two steps. Firstly, a surrogate model is developed through the embed to control method, which employs an encoder-transition-decoder structure to learn latent dynamics. Leveraging this proxy model, reinforcement learning is utilized to find an optimal strategy that maximizes economic benefits while satisfying various control constraints. The reinforcement learning agent receives the latent state space representation and immediate reward tailored for CO2 sequestration and choose real-time controls which are subject to predefined engineering constraints in order to maximize the long-term cumulative rewards. To demonstrate its effectiveness, this framework is applied to a compositional simulation model where CO2 is injected into saline aquifer. The results reveal that our surrogate model-based reinforcement learning approach significantly optimizes CO2 sequestration strategies, leading to notable economic gains compared to baseline scenarios.</description>

      <title>A time-adaptive finite element phase-field model suitable for rate-independent fracture mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of cracks is an important topic - both in engineering as well as in mathematics. Since crack propagation is characterized by a free boundary value problem (the geometry of the crack is not known beforehand, but part of the solution), approximations of the underlying sharp-interface problem based on phase-field models are often considered. Focusing on a rate-independent setting, these models are defined by a unidirectional gradient-flow of an energy functional. Since this energy functional is non-convex, the evolution of the variables such as the displacement field and the phase-field variable might be discontinuous in time leading to so-called brutal crack growth. For this reason, solution concepts have to be carefully chosen in order to predict discontinuities that are physically reasonable. One such concept is that of Balanced Viscosity solutions (BV solutions). This concept predicts physically sound energy trajectories that do not jump across energy barriers. The paper deals with a time-adaptive finite element phase-field model for rate-independent fracture which converges to BV solutions. The model is motivated by constraining the pseudo-velocity of the crack tip. The resulting constrained minimization problem is solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical examples highlight the predictive capabilities of the model and furthermore show the efficiency and the robustness of the final algorithm.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral based particle initialization algorithm for Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for initializing particle distribution in SPH simulations of complex geometries have been proven essential for improving the accuracy of SPH simulations. However, no such algorithms exist for boundary integral SPH models, which can model complex geometries without needing virtual particle layers. This study introduces a Boundary Integral based Particle Initialization (BIPI) algorithm. It consists of a particle-shifting technique carefully designed to redistribute particles to fit the boundary by using the boundary integral formulation for particles adjacent to the boundary. The proposed BIPI algorithm gives special consideration to particles adjacent to the boundary to prevent artificial volume compression. It can automatically produce a "uniform" particle distribution with reduced and stabilized concentration gradient for domains with complex geometrical shapes. Finally, a number of examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Incremental Learning with Dual Concept Drift Detection for Identifying Anomalous Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, the continuous generation of extensive streaming data across diverse domains has become pervasive. Yet, a significant portion of this data remains unlabeled, posing a challenge in identifying infrequent events such as anomalies. This challenge is further amplified in non-stationary environments, where the performance of models can degrade over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a new method referred to as VAE4AS (Variational Autoencoder for Anomalous Sequences). VAE4AS integrates incremental learning with dual drift detection mechanisms, employing both a statistical test and a distance-based test. The anomaly detection is facilitated by a Variational Autoencoder. To gauge the effectiveness of VAE4AS, a comprehensive experimental study is conducted using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by anomalous rates below 10\% and recurrent drift. The results show that the proposed method surpasses both robust baselines and state-of-the-art techniques, providing compelling evidence for their efficacy in effectively addressing some of the challenges associated with anomalous sequence detection in non-stationary streaming data.</description>
