      <title>Prover-Adversary games for systems over (non-deterministic) branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Pudlak-Buss style Prover-Adversary games to characterise proof systems reasoning over deterministic branching programs (BPs) and non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs). Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Brooks' theorem via Partial Coloring is Hard Classically and Locally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and distributed complexity of \emph{$k$-partial $c$-coloring} where $c=k$, a natural generalization of Brooks' theorem where each vertex should be colored from the palette $\{1,\ldots,c\} = \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that it must have at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ neighbors colored differently. Das, Fraigniaud, and Ros{\'{e}}n~[OPODIS 2023] showed that the problem of $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits efficient centralized and distributed algorithms and posed an open problem about the status of the distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring. We show that the problem becomes significantly harder when the number of colors is reduced from $k+1$ to $k$ for every constant $k\geq 3$.
  In the classical setting, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a $k$-partial $k$-coloring is NP-complete for every constant $k \geq 3$, revealing a sharp contrast with the linear-time solvable $(k+1)$-color case. For the distributed LOCAL model, we establish an $\Omega(n)$-round lower bound for computing $k$-partial $k$-colorings, even when the graph is guaranteed to be $k$-partial $k$-colorable. This demonstrates an exponential separation from the $O(\log^2 k \cdot \log n)$-round algorithms known for $(k+1)$-colorings.
  Our results leverage novel structural characterizations of ``hard instances'' where partial coloring reduces to proper coloring, and we construct intricate graph gadgets to prove lower bounds via indistinguishability arguments.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond Twin-width? CSPs with Unbounded Domain and Few Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of constraint satisfaction problems geared towards instances with few variables but with domain of unbounded size (udCSP). Our model is inspired by recent work on FPT algorithms for MinCSP where frequently both upper and lower bounds on the parameterized complexity of a problem correspond to $k$-variable udCSPs; e.g., the FPT algorithms for Boolean MinCSP (Kim et al., SODA 2023) and Directed Multicut with three cut requests (Hatzel et al., SODA 2023) both reduce to k-variable udCSPs, and the canonical W[1]-hardness construction in the area, Paired Min Cut by Marx and Razgon (IPL 2009), is effectively a k-variable udCSP.
  The udCSP framework represents constraints with unbounded domains via a collection $\mathcal{M}$ of unary maps into a finite-domain base language $\Gamma$. We develop an algebraic theory for studying the complexity of udCSP$(\Gamma,\mathcal{M})$ with a Galois connection based on partial multifunctions.
  We study three types of maps: unrestricted, one-hot, and monotone. For unrestricted maps, the problem is W[1]-hard for all but trivial cases, and for one-hot maps, the characterization coincides with Marx' FPT dichotomy for Boolean Weighted CSPs (Computational Complexity 2005). For the case of monotone maps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call ordered polymorphisms; we identify the "connector" polymorphism as the likely FPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\Gamma$,Mo) defines all permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary language implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV; Bonnet et al., JACM 2024). For non-binary languages, where twin-width does not apply, the polymorphism coincides with a notion of bounded projected grid-rank; however, we leave the FPT question for this case open.</description>

      <title>An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of many homogeneous hypergraphs including the random hypergraphs and hypergraphs omitting a generalised clique. This forms a vast generalisation of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC'11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr\'acz (ICALP'16) on graph satisfiability.</description>

      <title>A unified worst case for classical simplex and policy iteration pivot rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Markov decision processes for which the policy iteration algorithm needs an exponential number of improving switches with Dantzig's rule, with Bland's rule, and with the Largest Increase pivot rule. This immediately translates to a family of linear programs for which the simplex algorithm needs an exponential number of pivot steps with the same three pivot rules. Our results yield a unified construction that simultaneously reproduces well-known lower bounds for these classical pivot rules, and we are able to infer that any (deterministic or randomized) combination of them cannot avoid an exponential worst-case behavior. Regarding the policy iteration algorithm, pivot rules typically switch multiple edges simultaneously and our lower bound for Dantzig's rule and the Largest Increase rule, which perform only single switches, seem novel. Regarding the simplex algorithm, the individual lower bounds were previously obtained separately via deformed hypercube constructions. In contrast to previous bounds for the simplex algorithm via Markov decision processes, our rigorous analysis is reasonably concise.</description>

      <title>Tight (Double) Exponential Bounds for Identification Problems: Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. We prove the (tight) conditional lower bounds for these problems when parameterized by treewidth and solution as. Formally, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|))$. This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth. Then, we first prove that \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails. To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. Finally, we prove that \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|)$. This is also a rare example of the problem that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.
  We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds.</description>

      <title>CMSO-transducing tree-like graph decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give $\operatorname{CMSO}$-transductions that, given a graph $G$, output its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant $\operatorname{MSO}$, a strictly more expressive logic than $\operatorname{CMSO}$. Our methods more generally yield $\operatorname{C}_2\!\operatorname{MSO}$-transductions that output the canonical decompositions of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>
