      <title>A Critique of Du's "A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for 3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the claims made by the paper "A polynomial-time algorithm for 3-SAT" by Lizhi Du. The paper claims to provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-complete problem 3-SAT. In examining the paper's argument, we find a flaw in one of the main sections of its algorithm. We argue that this flaw causes the paper's algorithm to incorrectly decide that an infinite family of satisfiable 3-CNF boolean formulas are not satisfiable. Therefore, the paper does not establish that P = NP.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of tiling the plane with a fixed number of Wang bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the fixed parameter undecidability of tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles, Jeandel and Rolin show that the tiling problem for a set of 44 Wang bars is undecidable. In this paper, we improve their result by proving that whether a set of 29 Wang bars can tile the plane is undecidable. As a consequence, the tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles with color deficiency of 25 is also undecidable.</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we settle two open questions raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (2016) by providing:
  1. A matching lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a multipartite pure state is product or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of Harrow and Montanaro (2010) is optimal, even for bipartite states;
  2. The first non-trivial lower bound $\Omega(r/\varepsilon)$ for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite pure state is at most $r$ or $\varepsilon$-far.
  We also show other new sample lower bounds, for example:
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite pure state is maximally entangled or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (2015) is optimal for this task.
  Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new quantum query lower bounds:
  - A query lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\sqrt{d/\Delta})$ for the $d$-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, improving the prior best $\Omega(\sqrt[4]{d})$ by She and Yuen (2023) and $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024).
  Furthermore, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups II: Baumslag Solitar groups $\mathrm{BS}(n,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second paper we solve the twisted conjugacy problem for even dihedral Artin groups, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \mid {}_{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m \geq 2$ is even, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab\dots$ of length $m$. Similar to odd dihedral Artin groups, we prove orbit decidability for all subgroups $A \leq \mathrm{Aut}(G(m))$, which then implies that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of even dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Identity Testing via Evaluation of Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hitting set generator for Polynomial Identity Testing based on evaluations of low-degree univariate rational functions at abscissas associated with the variables. We establish an equivalence up to rescaling with a generator introduced by Shpilka and Volkovich, which has a similar structure but uses multivariate polynomials.
  We initiate a systematic analytic study of the power of hitting set generators by characterizing their vanishing ideals, i.e., the sets of polynomials that they fail to hit. We provide two such characterizations for our generator. First, we develop a small collection of polynomials that jointly produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain tight bounds on the minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class size of set-multilinearity in the vanishing ideal. Second, inspired by a connection to alternating algebra, we develop a structured deterministic membership test for the multilinear part of the vanishing ideal. We present a derivation based on alternating algebra along with the required background, as well as one in terms of zero substitutions and partial derivatives, avoiding the need for alternating algebra.
  As evidence of the utility of our analytic approach, we rederive known derandomization results based on the generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application in derandomization / lower bounds for read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Identity Testing of Noncommutative Rational Formulas in Deterministic Quasipolynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational Identity Testing (RIT) is the decision problem of determining whether or not a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. It admits a deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithm [Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016); Ivanyos, Qiao, Subrahmanyam (2018); Hamada and Hirai (2021)], and a randomized polynomial-time algorithm [Derksen and Makam (2017)] in the black-box setting, via singularity testing of linear matrices over the free skew field. Indeed, a randomized NC algorithm for RIT in the white-box setting follows from the result of Derksen and Makam (2017).
  Designing an efficient deterministic black-box algorithm for RIT and understanding the parallel complexity of RIT are major open problems in this area. Despite being open since the work of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016), these questions have seen limited progress. In fact, the only known result in this direction is the construction of a quasipolynomial-size hitting set for rational formulas of only inversion height two [Arvind, Chatterjee, Mukhopadhyay (2022)].
  In this paper, we significantly improve the black-box complexity of this problem and obtain the first quasipolynomial-size hitting set for all rational formulas of polynomial size. Our construction also yields the first deterministic quasi-NC upper bound for RIT in the white-box setting.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Seedless Condensers: Exploring the Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several new results for seedless condensers in the context of three related classes of sources: Non-Oblivious Symbol Fixing (NOSF) sources, one-sided NOSF (oNOSF) sources [AORSV, EUROCRYPT'20], and adversarial Chor-Goldreich (aCG) source [DMOZ, STOC'23]. We think of these sources as a sequence of random variables $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{X}_1,\dots,\mathbf{X}_\ell$ on $\ell$ symbols where at least $g$ out of these $\ell$ symbols are "good" (i.e., have some min-entropy requirement), denoted as a $(g,\ell)$-source, and the remaining "bad" $\ell-g$ symbols may adversarially depend on these $g$ good blocks. The difference between each of these sources is realized by restrictions on the power of the adversary. Prior to our work, the only known seedless condenser upper or lower bound in these settings is due to [DMOZ, STOC'23], where they explicitly construct a seedless condenser for a restricted subset of $(g,\ell)$-aCG sources.
  We show:
  1) oNOSF sources
  a) When $g\leq\ell/2$, we prove that condensing with error 0.99 above rate $\frac{1}{\lfloor \ell/g \rfloor}$ is impossible. In fact, we show that this is tight.
  b) For $g&gt; \ell/2$, we show the existence of excellent condensers for uniform oNOSF sources. In addition, we show the existence of similar condensers for oNOSF sources with only logarithmic min-entropy.
  2) aCG sources
  a) We observe that uniform aCG sources are equivalent to uniform oNOSF sources and consequently inherit the same results.
  b) We show that one cannot condense beyond the min-entropy gap of each block or condense low min-entropy CG sources above rate $1/2$.
  3) NOSF sources
  a) We show that condensing with constant error above rate $\frac{g}{\ell}$ is impossible for uniform NOSF sources for any $g$ and $\ell$, thus ruling out the possibility of any non-trivial condensing. This shows a distinction between NOSF sources and oNOSF sources.</description>

Abstract: The Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem asks for conditions under which a (finite or infinite) subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is contained on a curve of finite length. We show that for finite sets, the algorithm constructed by Schul (2007)and Badger-Naples-Vellis (2019) that solves the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem has polynomial time complexity and we determine the sharp exponent.</description>

      <title>A faster FPRAS for #NFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) A with m states, and a natural number n (presented in unary), the #NFA problem asks to determine the size of the set L(A_n) of words of length n accepted by A. While the corresponding decision problem of checking the emptiness of L(A_n) is solvable in polynomial time, the #NFA problem is known to be #P-hard. Recently, the long-standing open question -- whether there is an FPRAS (fully polynomial time randomized approximation scheme) for #NFA -- was resolved in \cite{ACJR19}. The FPRAS due to \cite{ACJR19} relies on the interreducibility of counting and sampling, and computes, for each pair of state q and natural number i &lt;= n, a set of O(\frac{m^7 n^7}{epsilon^7}) many uniformly chosen samples from the set of words of length i that have a run ending at q (\epsilon is the error tolerance parameter of the FPRAS). This informative measure -- the number of samples maintained per state and length -- also affects the overall time complexity with a quadratic dependence.
  Given the prohibitively high time complexity, in terms of each of the input parameters, of the FPRAS due to \cite{ACJR19}, and considering the widespread application of approximate counting (and sampling) in various tasks in Computer Science, a natural question arises: Is there a faster FPRAS for #NFA that can pave the way for the practical implementation of approximate #NFA tools? In this work, we demonstrate that significant improvements in time complexity are achievable. Specifically, we have reduced the number of samples required for each state to be independent of m, with significantly less dependence on $n$ and $\epsilon$, maintaining only \widetilde{O}(\frac{n^4}{epsilon^2}) samples per state.</description>
