      <title>GPU-Accelerated MATLAB Software for Atom-Ion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called atomiongpu.m, can massively parallelize MD simulations of trajectories of a trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters, initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of specific trajectories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase evolution of Coulomb-focused electrons in strong-field ionization probed by a standing light wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical phase evolution of Coulomb-focused electrons in strong-field ionization. We diffract the electrons with an ultrashort standing light wave to track their time-dependent phase. Our findings show that low-energy electrons exhibit a unique chromosome-shaped diffraction pattern, distinct from higher-energy electrons. Our numerical model quantitatively reproduces the experimental results, confirming this pattern maps the electron's time-dependent phase evolution as it escapes from a Coulomb potential. Our pulsed diffraction grating technique offers a new way to sense an electron's quantum phase without interfering its release mechanism.</description>

      <title>Simple Vector Magnetomter Based on Ground State Hanle Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2 line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal) dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved probing of recolliding electron wave packets in liquids and aqueous solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.</description>

      <title>Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: AICE - 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.</description>
