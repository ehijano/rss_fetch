      <title>Phase segregation of liquid-vapor systems with a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in the presence of external forces has attracted
  considerable attention since the initial works for solid mixtures.
  Despite this, only very few studies are available which address
  the segregation process of liquid-vapor systems under gravity.
  We present here an extensive study which takes into account both
  hydrodynamic and gravitational effects on the coarsening dynamics.
  An isothermal formulation of a lattice Boltzmann model for a liquid-vapor
  system with the van der Waals equation of state is adopted.
  In the absence of gravity, the growth of domains follows a power law
  with the exponent $2/3$ of the inertial regime.
  The external force deeply affects the observed morphology
  accelerating the coarsening of domains and favoring the liquid accumulation
  at the bottom of the system. Along the force direction,
  the growth exponent is found to increase with the gravity strength
  still preserving sharp interfaces since the Porod's law is found to be
  verified.
  The time evolution of the average thickness $L$
  of the layers of accumulated material at confining walls
  shows a transition from an initial regime where $L \simeq t^{2/3}$
  ($t$: time) to a late-time regime $L \simeq g t^{5/3}$ with $g$ the
  gravitational acceleration.
  The final steady state, made of two overlapped layers of liquid and
  vapor, shows a density profile in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Probing the elusive equilibrium crystal/liquid coexistence state in monodisperse hard-sphere colloids simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropically driven phase transitions in atomic and colloidal systems of monodisperse, purely repulsive hard spheres (MPRHS) are long-established in terms of distinct phases and phase envelopes via theory, simulations, and experiments. Frenkel proposed a mechanistic model for entropic phase separation in MPRHS, which lack obvious sources of competing entropy. He proposed that loss of long-range (configurational) entropy is offset by gain of short-range (vibrational) entropy - but its metastability would require hundreds of millions of years to phase separate. True to Frenkel's prediction, despite copious reports of liquid and solid lines, theoretical deduction of coexistence lines, and experimentally observed phase separation, decades of simulations built to match MPRHS atomic theory show no observation of explicit, spontaneously-formed liquid and crystal domains - transient mixtures have been observed but are subsequently overtaken by a single phase. To observe finite-time phase separation, we simulated weak perturbations of metastability in a large simulation of MPRHS: crystal seeding (2-4%) and hardness perturbations that augment short-range arrangements. Our simulations produced explicit phase separation and, as hardness was systematically increased toward the hard-sphere limit, recovered phase and coexistence lines close to atomic theory. To more closely mimic Frenkel's mechanistic model, we tested hardness perturbations alone. Samples with no crystal seeding and tiny hardness perturbation spontaneously phase separated in a narrower range of volume fractions. The near-pristine conditions emphasize MPRHS coexistence region metastability, and perturbations to short-range entropy via finite hardness provide satisfying access to the long range / short range entropy exchange competition underlying MPRHS phase separation.</description>

      <title>SAOS and LAOS rheology for differentiating chemical and physical crosslinking: A case study on PVA hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the viscoelastic behavior of chemically and physically crosslinked Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels near the critical gel point (GP) as well as further away from it, by means of small amplitude (SAOS) and large amplitude (LAOS) oscillatory shear experiments. Chemical crosslinking involved covalent bonding by means of glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker, while physical crosslinking was induced by freeze-thaw cycles. SAOS data analysis allowed evaluation of critical parameters such as the critical relaxation exponent n, gel strength S, and equilibrium modulus Ge, based on the dynamic self-similarity and fractal network structures at the GP. LAOS rheological data analysis showed that the chemically crosslinked system exhibited moderate strain-dependance due to the permanent covalent bonds, whereas the physically crosslinked system displayed significant strain-dependent nonlinearity due to strain dependent interactions at the crosslink entities. LAOS experiments, supported by Chebyshev coefficients and Lissajous-Bowditch plots, highlighted pronounced differences in nonlinear responses, underscoring the influence of crosslinking mechanisms on the network rheological behavior. The findings establish LAOS as a powerful tool for differentiating polymeric network structures, providing insights beyond those attained by conventional linear rheology. 50 pages 1 figures</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to tune interactions between absorptionless colloidal particle pairs. This is achieved via optimization of the spectral energy density of a homogeneous random optical field. Several standard and more exotic interaction potentials, as well as their negative counterparts, are shown to be successfully tuned. We show that the effective dimensionality of the space of potential functions that can be created by this means can reach up to several tens.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Wheel-Within</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is this old, eternal question: Why don't animals have wheels? In this perspective we show that they actually do. And they do so in a physically extraordinary way -- by combining incompatible elasticity, differential geometry and dissipative self-organization. Nature's wheel -- the ``wheel-within'' -- has been mysteriously concealed in plain sight, yet it spins in virtually every slender-body organism: in falling cats, crocodilians spinning to subdue their prey, rolling fruit-fly larvae, circumnutating plants and even in some of our own body movements. Flying somehow under the radar of our cognition, in recent years the wheel-within also tacitly entered the field of soft robotics, finally opening our eyes for its ubiquitous role in Nature. We here identify its underlying physical ingredients, namely the existence of a neutrally-stable, shape-invariant and actively driven elastic mode. We then reflect on various man-made realizations of the wheel-within and outline where it could be spinning from here.</description>

      <title>Emergence of mixed orientational ordering in quasi-one-dimensional superdisk and superball fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a mixed orientational structure in the quasi-one-dimensional fluid of hard non-spherical bodies with the exact calculation of the thermodynamic and structural quantities using the transfer operator method. The mixed arrangement, which is spatially uniform, but orientionally ordered, cannot be identified with conventional mesophases such as tetratic, cubatic and nematic. It is found that the particles form a mixed orientational arrangement with preferred parallel and perpendicular orientations in a channel, where the number of parallel and perpendicularly oriented particles is not equal even at the close packing density. The mixed structure can be stabilized with hard bodies having equal side lengths in parallel and perpendicular orientations along the channel. These conditions can be realized with colloidal superdisks (superballs) if the curvature of neighboring sides (faces) are different. We show that even a small stretching of the superparticle destabilizes mixed ordering due to perfect nematic order evolving upon approaching close-packing.</description>

      <title>Space-filling discrete helices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are linear chain molecules that play a central role in life and health. Protein native state folds are modular assemblies of space-filling building blocks of {\alpha}-helices, \{beta}-sheets and tight turns. Here we deduce the structures of a countable set of space-filling helical forms of a uniform discrete thick string from first principles with no additional input or adjustable parameters. These forms occur in correspondence with the natural numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences that fit the geometrical requirements. Our work suggests that geometry and chemistry are complementary ways of looking at proteins and suggests a route for developing a unified framework for understanding proteins.</description>

      <title>Tailoring materials into kirigami robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and adaptable solutions. Kirigami structures, characterized by their bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through various energy sources, while kirigami sensors bridge the gap between electrical conductivity and compliance. Kirigami-integrated batteries enable energy storage directly within robot structures, enhancing flexibility and compactness. Kirigami-controlled mechanisms mimic mechanical computations, enabling advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and memory functions. Applications of kirigami-enabled robots include grasping, locomotion, and wearables, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments and tasks. Despite promising opportunities, challenges remain in the design of cut patterns for a given function and streamlining fabrication techniques.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Fast event-driven simulations for soft spheres: from dynamics to Laves phase nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of a Rouse polymer in a fluctuating correlated medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the average position of the center of mass of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium value. This is a manifestation of the non-Markovian nature of the effective evolution of the position of the center of mass, once the degrees of freedom of the medium have been integrated out. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, particularly when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.</description>

      <title>Toughness of double network hydrogels: the role of reduced stress propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</description>

      <title>Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.</description>

Abstract: We show theoretically that an imposed uniaxial anisotropy leads to new universality classes for the dynamics of active particles suspended in a viscous fluid. In the homogeneous state, their concentration relaxes superdiffusively, stirred by the long-ranged flows generated by its own fluctuations, as confirmed by our numerical simulations. Increasing activity leads to an anisotropic diffusive instability, driven by an active contribution to the particle current proportional to the local curvature of the suspension velocity profile.</description>

      <title>Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil</title>

Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Quorum Sensing and Absorbing Phase Transitions in Colloidal Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations, and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.</description>
