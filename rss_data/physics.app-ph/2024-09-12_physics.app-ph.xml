      <title>Simultaneous Crystallization Effects in Multiple Levitated Plasma-Functionalized Graphene Nanoflake Nanofluid Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is a container-free method for examining novel crystallization effects, though liquid-to-solid phase change has seen little investigation for levitated nanofluids. Recent developments have allowed for examining the morphological and temperature evolution of multiple levitated nanofluid droplets freezing simultaneously. The fundamental effect of adding nanoparticles to a levitated crystallization system is crystal growth rate enhancement from improved mass transfer at the growing solid front. Nucleation times are unaffected as freezing is initiated by secondary ice nucleation particles (INPs). Instead, the enhancement produces higher instantaneous nucleation pressures and more cracking in the primary ice shell. In turn, more INPs are ejected, resulting in faster protrusion formation on the droplet surface (hastened further in systems containing adjacent droplets). The crystal matrix also includes more defects, resulting in liquid escaping and forming beads at the droplet base and optical clarity loss. During crystal decomposition, thermal gradients create convective currents dampened by the same transport phenomena that enhance crystal growth. Suspension loss after a crystallization-decomposition cycle reduced opacity and light absorbance such that the droplets were 62% closer in appearance to water. However, the non-isobaric, sample-encompassing cooling process resulted in smaller particle clusters than if the droplets were frozen on a solid surface.</description>

      <title>Selective Actuation Enabled Multifunctional Magneto-mechanical Metamaterial for Programming Elastic Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metamaterials are a type of metamaterial with tunable properties enabled by structural reconfigurations. Existing active metamaterials often achieve only a limited number of structural reconfigurations upon the application of an external load across the entire structure. Here, we propose a selective actuation strategy for inhomogeneous deformations of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which allows for the integration of multiple functionalities into a single metamaterial design. Central to this actuation strategy is that a magnetic field is applied to specific unit cells instead of the entire metamaterial, and the unit cell can transform between two geometrically distinct shapes, which exhibit very different mechanical responses to elastic wave excitations. Our numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate that the tunable response of the unit cell, coupled with inhomogeneous deformation achieved through selective actuation, unlocks multifunctional capabilities of magneto-mechanical metamaterials such as tunable elastic wave transmittance, elastic waveguide, and vibration isolation. The proposed selective actuation strategy offers a simple but effective way to control the tunable properties and thus enhance the programmability of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which also expands the application space of magneto-mechanical metamaterials in elastic wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Hopping Transfer Optimizes Avalanche Multiplication in Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, avalanche multiplication has been observed in TMDC-based FETs, enhancing sensor performance with high sensitivity. However, the high voltage required for operation can damage the FETs, making it crucial to reduce the breakdown voltage for effective sensing applications. Here, we demonstrate that the utilization of hopping transfer induced by high-density defects can effectively reduce the breakdown voltage in TMDCs FETs. By substituting oxygen atoms for sulfur atoms in a monolayer of MoS2, we create MoS2-xOx, with x carefully adjusted within the range of 0 to 0.51. Oxygen doping reduces the bandgap of TMDCs and enhances ion collision rates. Moreover, higher levels of oxygen doping (x &gt; 0.41) in MoS2-xOx exhibit nearest-neighbor hopping behavior, leading to a significant enhancement in electron mobility. These improvements result in a decrease in the breakdown voltage of avalanche multiplication from 26.2 V to 12.6 V. Additionally, we propose avalanche multiplication in MoS2-xOx as an efficient sensing mechanism to overcome the limitations of gas sensing. The MoS2-xOx sensors display an ultra-high response to NO2 gas in the air, with a response of 5.8x103 % to NO2 gas of 50 ppb at room temperature, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than resistance-type gas detectors based on TMDCs. This work demonstrates that hopping transfer induced by high-density oxygen defects can effectively decrease the breakdown voltage of MoS2-xOx FETs, enhancing avalanche multiplication and serving as a promising mechanism for ultrasensitive gas detection.</description>

      <title>Modelling of nucleate pool boiling on coated substrates using machine learning and empirical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface modification results in substantial improvement in pool boiling heat transfer. Thin film-coated and porous-coated substrates, through different materials and techniques, significantly boost heat transfer through increased nucleation due to the presence of micro-cavities on the surface. The existing models and empirical correlations for boiling on these coated surfaces are constrained by specific operating conditions and parameter ranges and are hence limited by their prediction accuracy. This study focuses on developing an accurate and reliable Machine Learning (ML) model by effectively capturing the actual relationship between the influencing variables. Various ML algorithms have been evaluated on the thin film-coated and porous-coated datasets amassed from different studies. The CatBoost model demonstrated the best prediction accuracy after cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. For the optimized CatBoost model, SHAP analysis has been carried out to identify the prominent influencing parameters and interpret the impact of parameter variation on the target variable. This model interpretation clearly justifies the decisions behind the model predictions, making it a robust model for the prediction of nucleate boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) on coated surfaces. Finally, the existing empirical correlations have been assessed, and new correlations have been proposed to predict the HTC on these surfaces with the inclusion of influential parameters identified through SHAP interpretation.

      <title>Nanoporosity imaging by positronium lifetime tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) is a well-established non-destructive technique used for nanostructural characterization of porous materials. It is based on the annihilation of a positron and an electron. Mean positron lifetime in the material depends on the free voids size and molecular environment, allowing the study of porosity and structural transitions in the nanometer scale. We have developed a novel method enabling spatially resolved PALS, thus providing tomography of nanostructural characterization of an extended object. Correlating space (position) and structural (lifetime) information brings new insight in materials studies, especially in the characterization of the purity and pore distribution. For the first time, a porosity image using stationary positron sources for the simultaneous measurement of the porous polymers XAD4, silica aerogel powder IC3100, and polyvinyl toluene scintillator PVT by the J-PET tomograph is demonstrated</description>

      <title>Elliptical Silicon Nanowire Covered by the SEI in a 2D Chemo-Mechanical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical interplay between silicon anodes and their surrounding solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essential to improve the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. We model and simulate a 2D elliptical silicon nanowire with SEI via a thermodynamically consistent chemo-mechanical continuum ansatz using a higher order finite element method in combination with a variable-step, variable-order time integration scheme. Considering a soft viscoplastic SEI for three half cycles, we see at the minor half-axis the largest stress magnitude at the silicon nanowire surface, leading to a concentration anomaly. This anomaly is caused by the shape of the nanowire itself and not by the SEI. Also for the tangential stress of the SEI, the largest stress magnitudes are at this point, which can lead to SEI fracture. However, for a stiff SEI, the largest stress magnitude inside the nanowire occurs at the major half-axis, causing a reduced concentration distribution in this area. The largest tangential stress of the SEI is still at the minor half-axis. In total, we demonstrate the importance of considering the mechanics of the anode and SEI in silicon anode simulations and encourage further numerical and model improvements.</description>

      <title>Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity learning in a planar magnetic domain wall artificial synapsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future neuromorphic architectures will require millions of artificial synapses, making understanding the physical mechanisms behind their plasticity functionalities mandatory. In this work, we propose a simplified spin memristor, where the resistance can be controlled by magnetic field pulses, based on a Co/Pt multilayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as a synapsis emulator. We demonstrate plasticity and spike time dependence plasticity (STDP) in this device and explored the underlying magnetic mechanisms using Kerr microscopy imaging and Hall magneto-transport measurements. A well-defined threshold for magnetization reversal and the continuous resistance states associated with the micromagnetic configuration are the basic properties allowing plasticity and STDP learning mechanisms in this device.</description>

      <title>On-demand realization of topological states using Miura-folded metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in topological metamaterials have unveiled fruitful physics and numerous applications. Whereas initial efforts focus on achieving topologically protected edge states through principles of structural symmetry, the burgeoning field now aspires to customize topological states, tailoring their emergence and frequency. Here, our study presents the realization of topological phase transitions utilizing compliant mechanisms on the facets of Miura-folded metamaterials. This approach induces two opposite topological phases, leading to topological states at the interface. Moreover, we exploit the unique folding behavior of Miura-folded metamaterials to tune the frequency of topological states and dynamically toggle their presence. Our research not only paves the way for inducing topological phase transitions in Miura-folded structures but also enables the on-demand control of topological states, with promising applications in wave manipulation and vibration isolation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-wideband integrated microwave photonic multi-parameter measurement system on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on microwave signal measurement techniques is risen, driven by the expanding urgent demands of wireless communication, global positioning systems, remote sensing and 6G networks. In stark contrast with traditional electronic-based realization, the implementations of microwave signal measurement systems based on integrated compact photonic chip have exhibited distinct advantages in high operation bandwidth, light weight, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, although numerous integrated microwave photonic signal measurement systems have been reported, measurement bandwidth of the majority of them is still below 30 GHz due to the bandwidth limitation of electro-optical modulators (EOMs). Furthermore, previous studies often are more focused on the measurement of one single parameter (typically the frequency) of microwave signals, which has hindered their practical application in complex situations. Here, an integrated photonic microwave multi-parameter measurement system composed of microwave frequency measurement module and microwave phase amplitude measurement module based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform is reported. Utilizing this system, not only the ultra-high bandwidth (up to 60GHz) of microwave frequency, phase and amplitude measurement with low root-mean-squares errors (450MHz, 3.43{\deg} and 1.64% of the measurement for frequency, phase and amplitude, respectively), but also the time-domain reconstruction of sinusoidal microwave signals is achieved. This demonstration further broadens the application of integrated TFLN photonic devices in microwave signal measurement technology to address the bandwidth bottleneck of the ever-growing microwave networks in the future information society.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Device-Driven Screening of Sub-1-nm Thickness Oxide Semiconductors for Future CMOS Technology Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin oxide semiconductors with sub-1-nm thickness are promising building blocks for ultrascaled field-effect transistor (FET) applications due to their resilience against short-channel effects, high air stability, and potential for low-energy device operation. However, the n-type dominance of ultrathin oxide FET has hindered their integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which requires both n-and p-type devices. Here we develop an ab initio device-driven computational screening workflow to identify sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors for sub-5-nm FET applications. We demonstrate that ultrathin CaO2, CaO, and SrO are compatible with p-type device operations under both high-performance (HP) and low-power (LP) requirements specified by the International Technology Roadmap of Semiconductors (ITRS), thereby expanding the limited family of p-type oxide semiconductors. Notably, CaO and SrO emerge as the first-of-kind sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors capable of simultaneously meeting the ITRS HP and LP criteria for both n-and p-type devices. CaO and SrO FETs outperform many existing low-dimensional semiconductors, exhibiting scalability below 5-nm gate length. Our findings offer a pioneering effort in the ab initio, device-driven screening of sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors, significantly broadening the material candidate pool for future CMOS technology nodes.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40{\deg} to 43{\deg} over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20{\deg}. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32{\deg} to 50{\deg} when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25{\deg}. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40{\deg} to 40{\deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{\deg} across the operational frequency range.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, these models have been benchmarked relying on descriptors based on atoms' interaction energies or harmonic vibrations; their accuracy and efficiency in predicting observable and technologically relevant heat-conduction properties remains unknown. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to overcome the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials: high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness. We present the standards needed to achieve first-principles accuracy in conductivity predictions through model's fine-tuning, discussing benchmark metrics and precision/cost trade-offs. We apply our framework to a database of solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics that are microscopic in space and time, in which particles commit to a position, so-called excitations, are considered the elementary unit of relaxation in the Dynamic Facilitation (DF) theory of the glass transition. Meanwhile, geometric motifs known as locally favored structures (LFS) are associated with vitrification in many glassformers. Recent work indicates that the probability of particles found both in locally favored structures (LFS) and excitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is an anti-correlation between them [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621 (2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains unclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid experiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model glassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two in deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are well-packed, thus they are relatively stable.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing. High sensitivity in NV-based magnetic sensing requires a diamond sample with a high density of NV centers and a long electron spin dephasing time. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement method for determining the electron spin dephasing time of NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions to the dephasing time from various sources, including NV-NV interactions, strain distribution, $^{13}C$ nuclear spin, and P1 electron spin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of high-performance diamond samples and provide a comprehensive understanding of dephasing sources, enabling the optimization of NV-based quantum sensing applications.</description>
