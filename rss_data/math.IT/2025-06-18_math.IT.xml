      <title>Large Language Model Empowered Design of Fluid Antenna Systems: Challenges, Frameworks, and Case Studies for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fluid Antenna System (FAS), which enables flexible Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications, introduces new spatial degrees of freedom for next-generation wireless networks. Unlike traditional MIMO, FAS involves joint port selection and precoder design, a combinatorial NP-hard optimization problem. Moreover, fully leveraging FAS requires acquiring Channel State Information (CSI) across its ports, a challenge exacerbated by the system's near-continuous reconfigurability. These factors make traditional system design methods impractical for FAS due to nonconvexity and prohibitive computational complexity. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed for MIMO optimization, their limited generalization and fitting capabilities render them suboptimal for FAS. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) extend DL's capabilities by offering general-purpose adaptability, reasoning, and few-shot learning, thereby overcoming the limitations of task-specific, data-intensive models. This article presents a vision for LLM-driven FAS design, proposing a novel flexible communication framework. To demonstrate the potential, we examine LLM-enhanced FAS in multiuser scenarios, showcasing how LLMs can revolutionize FAS optimization.</description>

      <title>Capacity Characterization of Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike conventional systems using a fixed-location antenna, the channel capacity of the pinching-antenna system (PASS) is determined by the activated positions of pinching antennas. This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the exact capacity region, \romannumeral2) PASS yields a significantly enlarged capacity region compared to conventional fixed-antenna systems, and \romannumeral3) in the multiple-pinch case, TDMA and FDMA are capable of approaching the channel capacity limit.</description>

      <title>Identification for Molecular Communication Based on Diffusion Channel with Poisson Reception Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange at the nano- and microscale, with applications in areas like drug delivery and health monitoring. These event-driven scenarios often require alternatives to traditional transmission. Identification communication, introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck, offers such an approach, in which the receiver only determines whether a specific message was sent, suiting resource-limited and event-triggered systems. This paper combines MC with identification and proposes a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion-based model. Diffusion noise is modeled as a Poisson process, and a lower bound on channel capacity is derived. Simulations, microscopic, and with short-length deterministic codes, validate theoretical results, including the channel impulse response and error bounds. The findings support the design of practical MC systems, with potential use in testbed development.</description>

      <title>Covert Capacity of AWGN Channels under Average Error Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive upper and lower bounds for the covert capacity of Additive White Gaussian Noise channels when measuring reliability in terms of the average error probability and covertness in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. This characterization confirms the absence of strong converse for this setting in both the reliability and covertness parameters. The crux of our approach is to analyze a codebook of BPSK-modulated codewords carefully augmented with "all-zero" codewords.</description>

      <title>Fronthaul-Aware User-Centric Generalized Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fronthaul-limited generalized zeroforcing-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multiple-antenna users and multipleantenna access points (APs) relying on both cooperative beamforming (CB) and user-centric (UC) clustering. The proposed framework is very general and can be degenerated into different special cases, such as pure CB/pure UC clustering, or fully centralized CB/fully distributed beamforming. We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups. Numerical results show that for the centralized CB, the proposed power optimization provides nearly 59% improvement in the average sum SE over the heuristic approach, and 312% improvement, when the distributed beamforming is employed.</description>

      <title>Joint Error Correction and Fading Channel Estimation Enhancement Leveraging GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE). When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.</description>

      <title>Taming Polysemanticity in LLMs: Provable Feature Recovery via Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose a novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes a new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically \highlight{prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features} when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and \highlight{demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters}. This work represents a foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.</description>

      <title>Union-Intersection Union-Find for Decoding Depolarizing Errors in Topological Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Union-Intersection Union-Find (UIUF) algorithm for decoding depolarizing errors in topological codes, combining the strengths of iterative and standard Union-Find (UF) decoding. While iterative UF improves performance at moderate error rates, it lacks an error correction guarantee. To address this, we develop UIUF, which maintains the enhanced performance of iterative UF while ensuring error correction up to half the code distance. Through simulations under code capacity, phenomenological, and biased noise models, we show that UIUF significantly outperforms UF, reducing the logical error rate by over an order of magnitude (at around $10^{-5}$). Moreover, UIUF achieves lower logical error rates than the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder on rotated surface codes under both the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, while preserving efficient linear-time complexity.</description>

      <title>Multiperiodic Processes: Ergodic Sources with a Sublinear Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct multiperiodic processes -- a simple example of stationary ergodic stochastic processes over natural numbers that enjoy the vanishing entropy rate under a mild condition. Multiperiodic processes are supported on randomly shifted deterministic sequences called multiperiodic sequences, which can be efficiently generated using an algorithm called the Infinite Clock. Under a suitable parameterization, multiperiodic sequences exhibit relative frequencies of particular numbers given by Zipf's law. Exactly in the same setting, the respective multiperiodic processes satisfy an asymptotic power-law growth of block entropy, called Hilberg's law. Hilberg's law is deemed to hold for statistical language models, in particular.</description>

      <title>DFT-s-OFDM-based On-Off Keying for Low-Power Wake-Up Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G-Advanced and likely 6G will support a new low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) enabling low-power devices, equipped with a complementary ultra low-power receiver to monitor wireless traffic, to completely switch off their main radio. This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will emulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope detection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols within single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse multiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive signal design framework for DFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients are derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online and repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain processing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK waveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and post-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors, proposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as such. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest, rectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to their limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset, and so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK symbol energy are analyzed and shown to improve the bit error rate performance under practical conditions.</description>

      <title>Identification Over Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study message identification over the noisy permutation channel. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially, and the maximum second-order exponent is same as the Shannon capacity of the DMC. We consider a $q$-ary noisy permutation channel where the transmitted vector is first permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random, and then passed through a DMC with strictly positive entries in its transition probability matrix $U$. In an earlier work, we showed that over $q$-ary noiseless permutation channel, $2^{c_n n^{q-1}}$ messages can be identified if $c_n\rightarrow 0$, and a strong converse holds for $2^{c_n n^{q-1}}$ messages if $c_n\rightarrow \infty$. For the $q$-ary noisy permutation channel, we show that message sizes growing as $2^{R_n \left( \frac{n}{\log n}\right)^{(r-1)/2}}$, where $r$ be the rank of $U$, are identifiable for any $R_n\rightarrow 0$. We also prove a strong converse result showing that for any sequence of identification codes with $$2^{\left(R_n n^{(q-1)/2}(\log n)^{1+\frac{(q-1)(q-2)}{2}}\right)},$$ messages, where $R_n \rightarrow \infty$, the sum of Type-I and Type-II error probabilities approaches at least $1$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Our converse proof uses the idea of channel resolvability. We propose a novel deterministic quantization scheme for quantization of a distribution over the set of all compositions/types by an $M$-type input distribution when the distortion is measured on the output distribution in total variation distance. This plays a key role in the converse proof. We have also studied identification with deterministic encoder and decoder, and proved tight achievability, weak converse, and strong converse.</description>

      <title>Amortized Locally Decodable Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error correcting codes that admit efficient decoding of individual message symbols without decoding the entire message. Unfortunately, known LDC constructions offer a sub-optimal trade-off between rate, error tolerance and locality, the number of queries that the decoder must make to the received codeword $\tilde {y}$ to recovered a particular symbol from the original message $x$, even in relaxed settings where the encoder/decoder share randomness or where the channel is resource bounded. We initiate the study of Amortized Locally Decodable Codes where the local decoder wants to recover multiple symbols of the original message $x$ and the total number of queries to the received codeword $y$ can be amortized by the total number of message symbols recovered. We demonstrate that amortization allows us to overcome prior barriers and impossibility results. We first demonstrate that the Hadamard code achieves amortized locality below $2$ -- a result that is known to be impossible without amortization. Second, we study amortized locally decodable codes in cryptographic settings where the sender and receiver share a secret key or where the channel is resource-bounded and where the decoder wants to recover a consecutive subset of message symbols $[L,R]$. In these settings we show that it is possible to achieve a trifecta: constant rate, error tolerance and constant amortized locality.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access II:from Symbol-wise to Codeword-wise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) system separates users within a finite field by utilizing different element-pairs (EPs) as virtual resources. The Cartesian product of distinct EPs forms an EP code, which serves as the input to a finite-field multiplexing module (FF-MUX). This allows the FFMA technique to reorder the channel coding and multiplexing modules, enabling the superimposed signals to function as codewords that can be decoded by a channel code. This flexibility allows the FFMA system to efficiently support a large number of users with short packet traffic, addressing the finite blocklength (FBL) challenge in multiuser reliable transmission. Designing EP codes is a central challenge in FFMA systems. In this paper, we construct EP codes based on a bit(s)-to-codeword transformation approach and define the corresponding EP code as a codeword-wise EP (CWEP) code. We then investigate the encoding process of EP codes, and propose unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) structural property constraints to design uniquely decodable CWEP codes. Next, we present the $\kappa$-fold ternary orthogonal matrix ${\bf T}_{\rm o}(2^{\kappa}, 2^{\kappa})$ over GF$(3^m)$, where $m = 2^{\kappa}$, and the ternary non-orthogonal matrix ${\bf T}_{\rm no}(M,m)$ over GF$(3^m)$, for constructing specific CWEP codes. Based on the proposed CWEP codes, we introduce three FFMA modes: channel codeword multiple access (FF-CCMA), code division multiple access (FF-CDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (FF-NOMA). Simulation results demonstrate that all three modes effectively support massive user transmissions with well-behaved error performance.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access III: from 2-ary to p-ary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) techniques from binary to general $p$-ary source transmission. We introduce element-assemblage (EA) codes over GF($p^m$), which generalize element-pair (EP) codes, and define two specific types for ternary transmission: orthogonal EA codes and double codeword EA (D-CWEA) codes. We propose a unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) constraint for the design of uniquely-decodable CWEA (UD-CWEA) codes, which include additive inverse D-CWEA (AI-D-CWEA) and basis decomposition D-CWEA (BD-D-CWEA) codes. Additionally, we introduce non-orthogonal CWEA (NO-CWEA) codes and their corresponding USPM constraint in the complex field. Furthermore, $p$-ary CWEA codes are constructed using a basis decomposition method, leveraging ternary decomposition for faster convergence and simplified encoder/decoder design. We present a performance analysis of the proposed FFMA system from two complementary perspectives: channel capacity and error performance. We demonstrate that equal power allocation achieves the theoretical channel capacity, and then investigate the finite blocklength (FBL) characteristics of FFMA systems. Moreover, we develop a rate-driven capacity alignment (CA) theorem based on the capacity-to-rate ratio (CRR) metric for error performance analysis. Finally, we compare $p$-ary transmission systems with classical binary transmission systems, revealing that low-order $p$-ary systems (e.g., $p = 3$) outperform binary systems at small loading factors, while higher-order systems (e.g., $p = 257$) excel at larger loading factors. These findings highlight the potential of $p$-ary systems, although practical implementations may benefit from decomposing $p$-ary systems into ternary systems to manage complexity.</description>

      <title>Compression of enumerations and gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the compressibility of enumerations in the context of Kolmogorov complexity, focusing on strong and weak forms of compression and their gain: the amount of auxiliary information embedded in the compressed enumeration. The existence of strong compression and weak gainless compression is shown for any computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The density problem of c.e. sets with respect to their prefix complexity is reduced to the question of whether every c.e. set is well-compressible, which we study via enumeration games.</description>

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconciliation of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new asymptotic expansion approach for nonlinear filtering based on a small parameter in the system noise. This method expresses the filtering distribution as a power series in the noise level, where the coefficients can be computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. As a result, it addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. In the course of our derivation, we also show that classical linear filtering and smoothing equations, namely Kalman-Bucy filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, can be obtained in a unified and transparent manner from an explicit formula for the conditional distribution of the hidden path.</description>

      <title>On key exchange protocol based on Two-side multiplication action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a cryptanalysis of a key exchange protocol based on the digital semiring. For this purpose, we find the maximal solution of a linear system over such semiring, and use the properties of circulant matrix to demonstrate that the protocol is vulnerable. Specifically, we provide an efficient attack that recovers the shared secret key from publicly exchanged information for any instance of the digital semiring in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Distribution free M-estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.</description>
