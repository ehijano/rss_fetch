      <title>mdCATH: A Large-Scale MD Dataset for Data-Driven Computational Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein structure determination are revolutionizing our understanding of proteins. Still, a significant gap remains in the availability of comprehensive datasets that focus on the dynamics of proteins, which are crucial for understanding protein function, folding, and interactions. To address this critical gap, we introduce mdCATH, a dataset generated through an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a diverse and representative collection of protein domains. This dataset comprises all-atom systems for 5,398 domains, modeled with a state-of-the-art classical force field, and simulated in five replicates each at five temperatures from 320 K to 413 K. The mdCATH dataset records coordinates and forces every 1 ns, for over 62 ms of accumulated simulation time, effectively capturing the dynamics of the various classes of domains and providing a unique resource for proteome-wide statistical analyses of protein unfolding thermodynamics and kinetics. We outline the dataset structure and showcase its potential through four easily reproducible case studies, highlighting its capabilities in advancing protein science.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Pre-trained Models for Drug Target Affinity Prediction with Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-Target binding Affinity (DTA) prediction is essential for drug discovery. Despite the application of deep learning methods to DTA prediction, the achieved accuracy remain suboptimal. In this work, inspired by the recent success of retrieval methods, we propose $k$NN-DTA, a non-parametric embedding-based retrieval method adopted on a pre-trained DTA prediction model, which can extend the power of the DTA model with no or negligible cost. Different from existing methods, we introduce two neighbor aggregation ways from both embedding space and label space that are integrated into a unified framework. Specifically, we propose a \emph{label aggregation} with \emph{pair-wise retrieval} and a \emph{representation aggregation} with \emph{point-wise retrieval} of the nearest neighbors. This method executes in the inference phase and can efficiently boost the DTA prediction performance with no training cost. In addition, we propose an extension, Ada-$k$NN-DTA, an instance-wise and adaptive aggregation with lightweight learning. Results on four benchmark datasets show that $k$NN-DTA brings significant improvements, outperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, e.g, on BindingDB IC$_{50}$ and $K_i$ testbeds, $k$NN-DTA obtains new records of RMSE $\bf{0.684}$ and $\bf{0.750}$. The extended Ada-$k$NN-DTA further improves the performance to be $\bf{0.675}$ and $\bf{0.735}$ RMSE. These results strongly prove the effectiveness of our method. Results in other settings and comprehensive studies/analyses also show the great potential of our $k$NN-DTA approach.</description>

      <title>Molecular design for cardiac cell differentiation using a small dataset and decorated shape features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of small organic compounds for inducing stem cell differentiation is a time- and resource-intensive process. While data science could, in principle, facilitate the discovery of these compounds, novel approaches are required due to the difficulty of acquiring training data from large numbers of example compounds. In this paper, we demonstrate the design of a new compound for inducing cardiomyocyte differentiation using simple regression models trained with a data set containing only 80 examples. We introduce decorated shape descriptors, an information-rich molecular feature representation that integrates both molecular shape and hydrophilicity information. These models demonstrate improved performance compared to ones using standard molecular descriptors based on shape alone. Model overtraining is diagnosed using a new type of sensitivity analysis. Our new compound is designed using a conservative molecular design strategy, and its effectiveness is confirmed through expression profiles of cardiomyocyte-related marker genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments on human iPS cell lines. This work demonstrates a viable data-driven strategy for designing new compounds for stem cell differentiation protocols and will be useful in situations where training data is limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical report investigates variants of the Latent Inceptionism on Molecules (LIMO) framework to improve the properties of generated molecules. We conduct ablative studies of molecular representation, decoder model, and surrogate model training scheme. The experiments suggest that an autogressive Transformer decoder with GroupSELFIES achieves the best average properties for the random generation task.</description>

      <title>Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions fulfill "holographic" area laws, and the correlation fractal dimension is precisely $d_2=2$.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann machine learning and regularization methods for inferring evolutionary fields and couplings from a multiple sequence alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.05006v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse Potts problem to infer a Boltzmann distribution for homologous protein sequences from their single-site and pairwise amino acid frequencies recently attracts a great deal of attention in the studies of protein structure and evolution. We study regularization and learning methods and how to tune regularization parameters to correctly infer interactions in Boltzmann machine learning. Using $L_2$ regularization for fields, group $L_1$ for couplings is shown to be very effective for sparse couplings in comparison with $L_2$ and $L_1$. Two regularization parameters are tuned to yield equal values for both the sample and ensemble averages of evolutionary energy. Both averages smoothly change and converge, but their learning profiles are very different between learning methods. The Adam method is modified to make stepsize proportional to the gradient for sparse couplings. It is shown by first inferring interactions from protein sequences and then from Monte Carlo samples that the fields and couplings can be well recovered, but that recovering the pairwise correlations in the resolution of a total energy is harder for the natural proteins than for the protein-like sequences. Selective temperature for folding/structural constrains in protein evolution is also estimated.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Latent Space Optimization of Generative Molecular Design Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular design based on generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its efficiency for exploring high-dimensional molecular space to identify molecules with desired properties. While the efficacy of the initial model strongly depends on the training data, the sampling efficiency of the model for suggesting novel molecules with enhanced properties can be further enhanced via latent space optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective latent space optimization (LSO) method that can significantly enhance the performance of generative molecular design (GMD). The proposed method adopts an iterative weighted retraining approach, where the respective weights of the molecules in the training data are determined by their Pareto efficiency. We demonstrate that our multi-objective GMD LSO method can significantly improve the performance of GMD for jointly optimizing multiple molecular properties.</description>

      <title>ACEGEN: Reinforcement learning of generative chemical agents for drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a valuable tool in drug design, offering the potential to propose and optimize molecules with desired properties. However, striking a balance between capabilities, flexibility, reliability, and efficiency remains challenging due to the complexity of advanced RL algorithms and the significant reliance on specialized code. In this work, we introduce ACEGEN, a comprehensive and streamlined toolkit tailored for generative drug design, built using TorchRL, a modern RL library that offers thoroughly tested reusable components. We validate ACEGEN by benchmarking against other published generative modeling algorithms and show comparable or improved performance. We also show examples of ACEGEN applied in multiple drug discovery case studies. ACEGEN is accessible at \url{https://github.com/acellera/acegen-open} and available for use under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>CBGBench: Fill in the Blank of Protein-Molecule Complex Binding Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate potential drugs that can bind to a target protein and is greatly expedited by the aid of AI techniques in generative models. However, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, difficult reproducibility, and task singularity. Firstly, the absence of standardization can lead to unfair comparisons and inconclusive insights. To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative heterogeneous graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements various cutting-edge methods. Secondly, a single task on \textit{de novo} molecule generation can hardly reflect their capabilities. To broaden the scope, we have adapted these models to a range of tasks essential in drug design, which are considered sub-tasks within the graph fill-in-the-blank tasks. These tasks include the generative designation of \textit{de novo} molecules, linkers, fragments, scaffolds, and sidechains, all conditioned on the structures of protein pockets. Our evaluations are conducted with fairness, encompassing comprehensive perspectives on interaction, chemical properties, geometry authenticity, and substructure validity. We further provide the pre-trained versions of the state-of-the-art models and deep insights with analysis from empirical studies. The codebase for CBGBench is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/Edapinenut/CBGBench}.</description>
