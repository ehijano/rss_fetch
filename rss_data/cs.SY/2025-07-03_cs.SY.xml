      <title>Imitation Learning for Satellite Attitude Control under Unknown Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel satellite attitude control framework that integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to achieve robust performance under various unknown perturbations. Traditional control techniques often rely on precise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external perturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based expert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator failures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous results in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner policy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs and improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary experiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert can rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna orientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally, the GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories generated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping. The integration of GAIL further reduces sample complexity and demonstrates promising imitation capabilities, paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous spacecraft control systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Estimation Approach based on Fisher Information to Overcome the Challenges of LFP Battery SOC Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and Real-time State of Charge (SOC) estimation is essential for Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems due to safety and longevity. However, the flat Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)-SOC curve makes this task particularly challenging. This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and real-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and temperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the challenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive fisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation from two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit model-based parameter identification. The effectiveness of this strategy is rationalized by the information richness excited by external cycling signals. A 3D OCV-H-SOC map that captures the relationship between OCV, hysteresis, and SOC was proposed as the backbone, and can be generalizable to other widely adopted parameter-identification methods. Extensive validation under ideal and real-world use scenarios, including SOC-OCV flat zones, current bias, voltage quantization errors, low temperatures, and insufficient current excitations, have been performed using 4 driving profiles, i.e., the Orange County Transit Bus Cycle, the California Unified Cycle, the US06 Drive Cycle, and the New York City Cycle, where the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art unscented Kalman filter, long short-term memory networks and transformer in all validation cases.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-Based Tuning Criterion for PI Controllers in IPDT Systems With Unified Tracking and Disturbance Rejection Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a spectral-based tuning method for proportional-integral (PI) controllers in integrating-plus-dead-time (IPDT) systems. The design objective is to achieve unified exponential decay for both reference tracking and disturbance rejection by minimizing the spectral abscissa of the closed-loop system. A second-order semi-discrete model accurately captures the integrator and delay dynamics while enabling efficient dominant pole extraction. These discrete-time poles are mapped to continuous time and refined using Newton-Raphson iterations on the exact transcendental characteristic equation. The method produces a unique PI gain set without requiring heuristic trade-offs or weighting parameters. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed tuning achieves faster convergence and improved robustness margins compared to classical rules (Ziegler-Nichols, SIMC) and integral performance criteria (IAE, ITAE). The approach provides a transparent and computationally efficient framework for PI control in delay-dominant systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, society has witnessed significant advancements in emerging mobility systems. These systems refer to transportation solutions that incorporate digital technologies, automation, connectivity, and sustainability to create safer, more efficient, and user-centered mobility. Examples include connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), shared mobility services (car-pooling), electric vehicles, and mobility-as-a-service platforms. These innovations have the potential to greatly impact areas such as safety, pollution, comfort, travel time, and fairness. In this article, we explore the current landscape of CAVs. We discuss their role in daily life and their future potential, while also addressing the challenges they may introduce. Following, we also examine the practical difficulties in research associated with CAVs especially simulating and testing CAV-related algorithms in real-world settings. We present existing solutions that aim to overcome these limitations. Finally, we provide an accessible introduction to modeling CAVs using basic kinematic principles and offer an open-source tutorial to help interested students begin exploring the field.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling Through Time Series: A Probabilistic Visibility Graph for Local and Global Pattern Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing availability of high-resolution, long-term time series data has highlighted the need for methods capable of capturing both local and global patterns. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.</description>

      <title>Synchronising DER inverters to weak grid using Kalman filter and LQR current controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-following (GFL) inverters are commonly used for integrating renewable energy sources into power grids. However, the dynamic performance of GFL models can be significantly impacted by the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in a weak grid, leading to instability due to inaccuracies in grid source phase angle estimation. The proposed method in this manuscript replaces the PLL with an Advanced Angle Estimation based Kalman Filter including a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller of the GFL. This method is robust in incorporating grid impedance terms as part of state space models in the Kalman Filter approach to estimate instantaneous phase angle using {\alpha}-\b{eta} Synchronous Reference Frame equations. The stability performance of the proposed approach is validated through eigenvalue analysis in a two-source case. Additionally, an LQR controller is employed to regulate capacitor voltage, inverter current, and the current at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). The proposed controller surpasses existing approaches in terms of accuracy and distortion reduction under abrupt grid impedance increases. Moreover, drop compensation is integrated into the Kalman Filter to enhance robustness of the inverter against external oscillation disturbances from a synchronous machine connected to the GFL via the PCC. The results in this paper demonstrate substantial improvement in oscillation damping across a range of frequencies compared with published research works.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Target Capture in 3D Engagements over Switched Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a leaderless cooperative guidance strategy for simultaneous time-constrained interception of a stationary target when the interceptors exchange information over switched dynamic graphs. We specifically focus on scenarios when the interceptors lack radial acceleration capabilities, relying solely on their lateral acceleration components. This consideration aligns with their inherent kinematic turn constraints. The proposed strategy explicitly addresses the complexities of coupled 3D engagements, thereby mitigating performance degradation that typically arises when the pitch and yaw channels are decoupled into two separate, mutually orthogonal planar engagements. Moreover, our formulation incorporates modeling uncertainties associated with the time-to-go estimation into the derivation of cooperative guidance commands to ensure robustness against inaccuracies in dynamic engagement scenarios. To optimize control efficiency, we analytically derive the lateral acceleration components in the orthogonal pitch and yaw channels by solving an instantaneous optimization problem, subject to an affine constraint. We show that the proposed cooperative guidance commands guarantee consensus in time-to-go values within a predefined time, which can be prescribed as a design parameter, regardless of the interceptors' initial configurations. We provide simulations to attest to the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Revolution Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization With Very Sparse Mesh Pseudospectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems are important and challenging in space mission design. In this paper, an efficient, accurate, and widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various objective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman transformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is monotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle. Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few seconds of computational time for challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Input Shaping Control for Flexible Structures Based on Unscented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial automation and smart manufacturing, the control of flexible structures and underactuated systems has become a critical research focus. Residual vibrations in these systems not only degrade operational efficiency but also pose risks to structural integrity and longevity. Traditional input shaping techniques, while effective, often suffer from performance degradation due to parameter inaccuracies and environmental disturbances. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative unscented Kalman filter-based zero vibration derivative input shaping (UZS) method. The proposed approach combines two key innovations: 1) a data-driven Unscented Kalman Filterfor real-time system parameter identification, and 2) a zero-vibration derivative (ZVD) input shaper for robust vibration suppression. To validate the effectiveness of UZS, we conducted extensive experiments on a vertical flexible beam platform, and the results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we have made the experimental datasets publicly available to facilitate further research. The findings highlight UZS's potential for practical applications in industrial automation, robotics, and precision engineering.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Design of a Reset-Based Filter: An Add-On Nonlinear Filter for Industrial Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a modified version of the Constant-in-Gain, Lead-in-Phase (CgLp) filter, which incorporates a feedthrough term in the First-Order Reset Element (FORE) to reduce the undesirable nonlinearities and achieve an almost constant gain across all frequencies. A backward calculation approach is proposed to derive the additional parameter introduced by the feedthrough term, enabling designers to easily tune the filter to generate the required phase. The paper also presents an add-on filter structure that can enhance the performance of an existing LTI controller without altering its robustness margins. A sensitivity improvement indicator is proposed to guide the tuning process, enabling designers to visualize the improvements in closed-loop performance. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study of an industrial wire bonder machine, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing low-frequency vibrations and improving overall control performance.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Coverage Control: A Distributed Tracker-Planner MPC Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying coverage control addresses the challenge of coordinating multiple agents covering an environment where regions of interest change over time. This problem has broad applications, including the deployment of autonomous taxis and coordination in search and rescue operations. The achievement of effective coverage is complicated by the presence of time-varying density functions, nonlinear agent dynamics, and stringent system and safety constraints. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-agent control framework for time-varying coverage under nonlinear constrained dynamics. Our approach integrates a reference trajectory planner and a tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme, which operate at different frequencies within a multi-rate framework. For periodic density functions, we demonstrate closed-loop convergence to an optimal configuration of trajectories and provide formal guarantees regarding constraint satisfaction, collision avoidance, and recursive feasibility. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm capable of handling nonperiodic density functions, making the approach suitable for practical applications. Finally, we validate our method through hardware experiments using a fleet of four miniature race cars.</description>

      <title>Vision-Aided ISAC in Low-Altitude Economy Networks via De-Diffused Visual Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging low-altitude economy networks (LAENets) require agile and privacy-preserving resource control under dynamic agent mobility and limited infrastructure support. To meet these challenges, we propose a vision-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for UAV-assisted access systems, where onboard masked De-Diffusion models extract compact semantic tokens, including agent type, activity class, and heading orientation, while explicitly suppressing sensitive visual content. These tokens are fused with mmWave radar measurements to construct a semantic risk heatmap reflecting motion density, occlusion, and scene complexity, which guides access technology selection and resource scheduling. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly maximize weighted energy and perception efficiency via radio access technology (RAT) assignment, power control, and beamforming, subject to agent-specific QoS constraints. To solve this, we develop De-Diffusion-driven vision-aided risk-aware resource optimization algorithm DeDiff-VARARO, a novel two-stage cross-modal control algorithm: the first stage reconstructs visual scenes from tokens via De-Diffusion model for semantic parsing, while the second stage employs a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based policy to adapt RAT selection, power control, and beam assignment based on fused radar-visual states. Simulation results show that DeDiff-VARARO consistently outperforms baselines in reward convergence, link robustness, and semantic fidelity, achieving within $4\%$ of the performance of a raw-image upper bound while preserving user privacy and scalability in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Re-examining the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Pseudospectral Methods for Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudospectral methods represent an efficient approach for solving optimal control problems. While Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) collocation points have traditionally been considered inferior to Legendre-Gauss (LG) and Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points in terms of convergence properties, this paper presents a rigorous re-examination of LGL-based methods. We introduce an augmented formulation that enhances the standard LGL collocation approach by incorporating an additional degree of freedom (DOF) into the interpolation structure. We demonstrate that this augmented formulation is mathematically equivalent to the integral formulation of the LGL collocation method. Through analytical derivation, we establish that the adjoint system in both the augmented differential and integral formulations corresponds to a Lobatto IIIB discontinuous collocation method for the costate vector, thereby resolving the previously reported convergence issues. Our comparative analysis of LG, LGR, and LGL collocation methods reveals significant advantages of the improved LGL approach in terms of discretized problem dimensionality and symplectic integration properties. Numerical examples validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the proposed LGL-based method achieves comparable accuracy to LG and LGR methods while offering superior computational performance for long-horizon optimal control problems due to the preservation of symplecticity.</description>

      <title>Auto-optimization of Energy Generation for Wave Energy Converters with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-optimization control framework for wave energy converters (WECs) to maximize energy generation under unknown and changing ocean conditions. The proposed control framework consists of two levels. The high-level controller operating at a longer time scale aims to maximize the average energy generation over several wave periods. The generated Power Take-Off (PTO) profile as the reference for the low-level physical system to follow. The new auto-optimization process leverages the parameterization of the non-stationary operation condition in WECs, establishing the relationship between the average energy generation and the key design parameters of the PTO force subject to the unknown wave parameters. The high-level controller is designed based on the concept of Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) to quickly learn the unknown wave parameters by actively probing the ocean condition, while generating the optimal PTO profile. During this process, the uncertainty of the estimated wave condition is quantified and embedded in the optimization cost function to enable active learning. Simulation results under unknown regular and irregular waves demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel auto-optimization WEC systems with active learning, outperforming model predictive control, extremum seeking and classic Bang-Bang control approaches.</description>

      <title>Variational Digital Twins</title>

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design, control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin maintains R2 &gt; 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with R2 &gt; 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient, and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across industrial and scientific energy systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Foundational Model and Stochastic Models for Forecasting Sporadic or Spiky Production Outages of High-Performance Machine Learning Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g., from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.</description>

      <title>HERCULES: Hardware accElerator foR stoChastic schedULing in hEterogeneous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient workload scheduling is a critical challenge in modern heterogeneous computing environments, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance workload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to dynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are compounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can have vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we present a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS). We modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost equations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a hardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism, precalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By introducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper establishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency, and energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional software scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent workload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060x speedup over single-threaded software scheduling policy implementations. This makes the SOS accelerator a strong candidate for deployment in high-performance computing system, deeplearning pipelines, and other performance-critical applications.</description>

      <title>An Error Bound for Aggregation in Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general aggregation framework for discounted finite-state infinite horizon dynamic programming (DP) problems. It defines an aggregate problem whose optimal cost function can be obtained off-line by exact DP and then used as a terminal cost approximation for an on-line reinforcement learning (RL) scheme. We derive a bound on the error between the optimal cost functions of the aggregate problem and the original problem. This bound was first derived by Tsitsiklis and van Roy [TvR96] for the special case of hard aggregation. Our bound is similar but applies far more broadly, including to soft aggregation and feature-based aggregation schemes.</description>

      <title>Approximation-free Control of Unknown Euler-Lagrangian Systems under Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel funnel-based tracking control algorithm for robotic systems with unknown dynamics and prescribed input constraints. The Euler-Lagrange formulation, a common modeling approach for robotic systems, has been adopted in this study to address the trade-off between performance and actuator safety. We establish feasibility conditions that ensure tracking errors evolve within predefined funnel bounds while maintaining bounded control efforts, a crucial consideration for robots with limited actuation capabilities. We propose two approximation-free control strategies for scenarios where these conditions are violated: one actively corrects the error, and the other stops further deviation. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance and safety of the approach through simulations and experimental validations. This work represents a significant advancement in funnel-based control, enhancing its applicability to real-world robotics systems with input constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested, highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However, reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines. Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over 100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Energy Markets (LEMs), though pivotal to the energy transition, face growing cybersecurity threats due to their reliance on smart grid communication standards and vulnerable Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices. This is a critical issue because such vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate market operations, compromise participants' privacy, and destabilize power distribution networks. This work maps LEM communication flows to existing standards, highlights potential impacts of key identified vulnerabilities, and simulates cyberattack scenarios on a privacy-preserving LEM model to assess their impacts. Findings reveal how attackers could distort pricing and demand patterns. We finally present recommendations for researchers, industry developers, policymakers, and LEM stakeholders to secure future LEM deployments.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on Federated LLMs in CyberEdge Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated large language models (FedLLMs) provide powerful generative capabilities in CyberEdge networks while protecting data privacy. However, FedLLMs remains highly vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, highlighting critical limitations, particularly under non-IID text distributions. In particular, current defenses primarily utilize distance-based outlier detection or norm constraints, operating under the assumption that adversarial updates significantly diverge from benign statistics. This assumption can fail when facing adaptive attackers targeting billionparameter LLMs. Next, this article investigates emerging Graph Representation-Based Model Poisoning (GRMP), a novel attack paradigm that leverages higher-order correlations among honest client gradients to synthesize malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate model updates. GRMP can effectively evade advanced defenses, resulting in substantial accuracy loss and performance degradation. Moreover, this article outlines a research roadmap emphasizing the importance of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, FedLLMs-specific vulnerability metrics, and evaluation frameworks to strengthen the robustness of future federated language model deployments.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into power systems requires the deployment of grid-forming inverters to ensure a stable operation. Accurate modeling of these devices is necessary. In this paper, a system identification approach to obtain low-dimensional models of grid-forming inverters is presented. The proposed approach is based on a Hammerstein-Wiener parametrization of the normal-form model. The normal-form is a gray-box model that utilizes complex frequency and phase to capture non-linear inverter dynamics. The model is validated on two well-known control strategies: droop-control and dispatchable virtual oscillators. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the normal-form accurately models inverter dynamics across various operating conditions. The approach shows great potential for enhancing the modeling of RES-dominated power systems, especially when component models are unavailable or computationally expensive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a constrained network flow problem and associated networked dynamics that resemble but are distinct from the well-known primal-dual dynamics of the constrained flow problem. Crucially, under a change of coordinates, the networked dynamics coincide with primal-dual dynamics associated with the constrained flow problem in edge coordinates. Next, we show that, under mild feasibility assumptions, the networked dynamics are globally asymptotically stable with respect to the set of optimizers of its associated constrained flow problem in nodal coordinates. Subsequently, we apply our stability results to establish frequency stability of power-limiting grid-forming droop control. Compared to conventional grid-forming droop control, power-limiting droop control explicitly accounts for active power limits of the generation (e.g., renewables) interfaced by the converter. While power-limiting droop control has been demonstrated to work well in simulation and experiment, analytical results are not readily available. Moreover, we (i) show that the converter frequencies synchronize to a common synchronous frequency for each grid-forming converter, (ii) characterize the synchronous frequency in the case of converters operating at their power limit, and (iii) establish that power-limiting droop control exhibits power-sharing properties similar to conventional unconstrained droop control. Finally, the analytical results are illustrated using an Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation.</description>

      <title>Progressive Barrier Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Constrained Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Progressive Barrier Lyapunov Function (p-BLF) for output- and full-state-constrained nonlinear control systems. Unlike traditional BLF methods, where control effort continuously increases as the state approaches the constraint boundaries, the p-BLF maintains minimal control effort in unconstrained regions and increases it progressively toward the boundaries. In contrast to previous methods with predefined safe zones and abrupt control activation, the p-BLF provides a smooth transition, improving continuity in the control response and enhancing stability by reducing chattering. Two forms of the p-BLF, logarithmic-based and rational-based, are developed to handle systems with either output constraints or full-state constraints. Theoretical analysis guarantees that all system states remain within the defined constraints, ensuring boundedness and stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained nonlinear control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18853v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace identification method (SIM) has become a widely adopted approach for the identification of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we derive finite sample high-probability error bounds for the system matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$ and the estimation of system poles. Specifically, we demonstrate that, ignoring the logarithmic factors, for an $n$-dimensional LTI system with no external inputs, the estimation error of these matrices decreases at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2n}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that achieving a constant estimation error requires a super-polynomial sample size in $n/m $, where $n/m$ denotes the state-to-output dimension ratio. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results.</description>

      <title>Power-Gas Infrastructure Planning under Weather-induced Supply and Demand Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>Learning with Linear Function Approximations in Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems with finite state and action spaces where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.</description>

      <title>Long-Context Linear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of long-context linear system identification, where the state $x_t$ of a dynamical system at time $t$ depends linearly on previous states $x_s$ over a fixed context window of length $p$. We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve the dependence of the rates on the dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.</description>

      <title>Small-signal stability of power systems with voltage droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of research. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring small-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$ droop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of each bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter control strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The analysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex frequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the small-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power imbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design considerations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase theorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and lines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to established inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our conditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters that are misconfigured and cause instability.</description>

      <title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.</description>
