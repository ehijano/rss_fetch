      <title>RNA-GPT: Multimodal Generative System for RNA Sequence Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNAs are essential molecules that carry genetic information vital for life, with profound implications for drug development and biotechnology. Despite this importance, RNA research is often hindered by the vast literature available on the topic. To streamline this process, we introduce RNA-GPT, a multi-modal RNA chat model designed to simplify RNA discovery by leveraging extensive RNA literature. RNA-GPT integrates RNA sequence encoders with linear projection layers and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for precise representation alignment, enabling it to process user-uploaded RNA sequences and deliver concise, accurate responses. Built on a scalable training pipeline, RNA-GPT utilizes RNA-QA, an automated system that gathers RNA annotations from RNACentral using a divide-and-conquer approach with GPT-4o and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to efficiently handle large datasets and generate instruction-tuning samples. Our experiments indicate that RNA-GPT effectively addresses complex RNA queries, thereby facilitating RNA research. Additionally, we present RNA-QA, a dataset of 407,616 RNA samples for modality alignment and instruction tuning, further advancing the potential of RNA research tools.</description>

      <title>Robust Genomic Prediction and Heritability Estimation using Density Power Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript delves into the intersection of genomics and phenotypic prediction, focusing on the statistical innovation required to navigate the complexities introduced by noisy covariates and confounders. The primary emphasis is on the development of advanced robust statistical models tailored for genomic prediction from single nucleotide polymorphism data in plant and animal breeding and multi-field trials. The manuscript highlights the significance of incorporating all estimated effects of marker loci into the statistical framework and aiming to reduce the high dimensionality of data while preserving critical information. This paper introduces a new robust statistical framework for genomic prediction, employing one-stage and two-stage linear mixed model analyses along with utilizing the popular robust minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) to estimate genetic effects on phenotypic traits. The study illustrates the superior performance of the proposed MDPDE-based genomic prediction and associated heritability estimation procedures over existing competitors through extensive empirical experiments on artificial datasets and application to a real-life maize breeding dataset. The results showcase the robustness and accuracy of the proposed MDPDE-based approaches, especially in the presence of data contamination, emphasizing their potential applications in improving breeding programs and advancing genomic prediction of phenotyping traits.</description>

      <title>Mixed Effects Deep Learning for the interpretable analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data by quantifying and visualizing batch effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are often confounded by technical or biological batch effects. Existing deep learning models mitigate these effects but often discard batch-specific information, potentially losing valuable biological insights. We propose a Mixed Effects Deep Learning (MEDL) autoencoder framework that separately models batch-invariant (fixed effects) and batch-specific (random effects) components. By decoupling batch-invariant biological states from batch variations, our framework integrates both into predictive models. Our approach also generates 2D visualizations of how the same cell appears across batches, enhancing interpretability. Retaining both fixed and random effect latent spaces improves classification accuracy.
  We applied our framework to three datasets spanning the cardiovascular system (Healthy Heart), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). With 147 batches in the Healthy Heart dataset, far exceeding typical numbers, we tested our framework's ability to handle many batches. In the ASD dataset, our approach captured donor heterogeneity between autistic and healthy individuals. In the AML dataset, it distinguished donor heterogeneity despite missing cell types and diseased donors exhibiting both healthy and malignant cells. These results highlight our framework's ability to characterize fixed and random effects, enhance batch effect visualization, and improve prediction accuracy across diverse datasets.</description>
