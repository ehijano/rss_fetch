      <title>Subgroup Separability of Artin Groups II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new criterion for determining whether an Artin group is subgroup separable (LERF), building upon a criterion introduced in a previous work. Specifically, we prove an Artin group is LERF if and only if it does not contain certain induced subgraphs, thus providing a more direct generalization of the Metaftsis-Raptis criterion for RAAGs. As consequences, we prove an Artin group is ERF if and only if it is a free abelian group and we establish a link between subgroup separability and coherence for Artin groups.</description>

      <title>BNSR-Invariants of Surface Houghton Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_{n}$ are a family of groups generalizing Houghton groups $H_n$, which are constructed as asymptotically rigid mapping class groups. We give a complete computation of the BNSR-invariants $\Sigma^{m}(P\mathcal{H}_{n})$ of their intersection with the pure mapping class group. To do so, we prove that the associated Stein--Farley cube complex is CAT(0), and we adapt Zaremsky's method for computing the BNSR-invariants of the Houghton groups. As a consequence, we give a criterion for when subgroups of $H_n$ and $P\mathcal{H}_{n}$ having the same finiteness length as their parent group are finite index. We also discuss the failure of some of these groups to be co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Congruences of regular variants of finite full transformation semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T_X$ be the full transformation monoid over a finite set $X$, and fix some $a\in T_X$ of rank $r$. The variant $T_X^a$ has underlying set $T_X$, and operation $f\star g=fag$. We study the congruences of the subsemigroup $P=Reg(T_X^a)$ consisting of all regular elements of $T_X^a$, and the lattice $Cong(P)$ of all such congruences. Our main structure theorem ultimately decomposes $Cong(P)$ as a specific subdirect product of $Cong(T_r)$ and the full equivalence relation lattices of certain combinatorial systems of subsets and partitions. We use this to give an explicit classification of the congruences themselves, and we also give a formula for the height of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Tautological characteristic classes II: the Witt class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an arbitrary infinite field. The cohomology group $H^2(SL(2,K), H_2\,SL(2,K))$ contains the class of the universal central extension. When studying representations of fundamental groups of surfaces in $SL(2,K)$ it is useful to have classes stable under deformations (Fenchel--Nielsen twists) of representations. We identify the maximal quotient of the universal class which is stable under twists as the Witt class of Nekovar. The Milnor--Wood inequality asserts that an $SL(2,{\bf R})$-bundle over a surface of genus $g$ admits a flat structure if and only if its Euler number is $\leq (g-1)$. We establish an analog of this inequality, and a saturation result for the Witt class. The result is sharp for the field of rationals, but not sharp in general.</description>

      <title>Weak property $(\mathrm{T}_{L^p})$ for discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for a countable discrete group $\Gamma$, property $(\mathrm{T}_{L^p})$ of Bader, Furman, Gelander and Monod is equivalent to the property that, whenever an $L^p$-representation of $\Gamma$ admits a net of almost invariant unit vectors, it has a non-zero invariant vector. Central in the proof is to show that the closure of the group of $\mathbb{T}$-valued $1$-coboundaries is a sufficient criteria for strong ergodicity of ergodic p.m.p. actions.</description>

      <title>Ducci on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ and the Maximum Length for $n$ Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Define the Ducci function $D: \mathbb{Z}_m^n \to \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ so $D(x_1,x_2, ...,x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \;\text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m)$. In this paper, we will prove that for $n$ odd and $m=2^lm_1$ where $m_1$ is odd, then the largest the length of a tuple can be is $l$ and $K(\mathbb{Z}_m^n)=\{(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n \; \mid \; x_1+x_2+ \cdots +x_n \equiv 0 \; \text{mod} \; 2^l\}$.</description>

      <title>Multiple correlations of spectra for higher rank Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe multiple correlations of Jordan and Cartan spectra for any finite number of Anosov representations of a finitely generated group. This extends our previous work on correlations of length and displacement spectra for rank one convex cocompact representations. Examples include correlations of the Hilbert length spectra for convex projective structures on a closed surface as well as correlations of eigenvalue gaps and singular value gaps for Hitchin representations. We relate the correlation problem to the counting problem for Jordan and Cartan projections of an Anosov subgroup with respect to a family of carefully chosen truncated {\it hypertubes}, rather than in tubes as in our previous work. Hypertubes go to infinity in a linear subspace of directions, while tubes go to infinity in a single direction and this feature presents a novel difficulty in this higher rank correlation problem.</description>

      <title>Strong topological Rokhlin property, shadowing, and symbolic dynamics of countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable group $G$ has the strong topological Rokhlin property (STRP) if it admits a continuous action on the Cantor space with a comeager conjugacy class. We show that having the STRP is a symbolic dynamical property. We prove that a countable group $G$ has the STRP if and only if certain sofic subshifts over $G$ are dense in the space of subshifts. A sufficient condition is that isolated shifts over $G$ are dense in the space of all subshifts.
  We provide numerous applications including the proof that a group that decomposes as a free product of finite or cyclic groups has the STRP. We show that finitely generated nilpotent groups do not have the STRP unless they are virtually cyclic; the same is true for many groups of the form $G_1\times G_2\times G_3$ where each factor is recursively presented. We show that a large class of non-finitely generated groups do not have the STRP, this includes any group with infinitely generated center and the Hall universal locally finite group.
  We find a very strong connection between the STRP and shadowing, a.k.a. pseudo-orbit tracing property. We show that shadowing is generic for actions of a finitely generated group $G$ if and only if $G$ has the STRP.</description>

      <title>On $2$-integral Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of $k$-integral graphs. A graph $\Gamma$ is called $k$-integral if the extension degree of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of $\Gamma$ over rational field $\mathbb Q$ is equal to $k$. We prove that for any positive integers $k$ and $\Delta$, the set of all finite connected graphs with algebraic degree at most $k$ and maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is finite. We study
  $2$-integral Cayley graphs over finite groups $G$ with respect to Cayley sets which are a union of conjugacy classes of $G$. Among other general results, we completely characterize all finite abelian groups having a connected $2$-integral Cayley graph with valency $2,3,4$ and $5$.
  Furthermore, we classify the finite groups $G$ that all Cayley graphs over $G$ with bounded valency are $2$-integral.</description>
