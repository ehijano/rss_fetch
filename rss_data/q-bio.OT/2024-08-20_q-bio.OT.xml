      <title>GitHub is an effective platform for collaborative and reproducible laboratory research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory research is a complex, collaborative process that involves several stages, including hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data generation and analysis, and manuscript writing. Although reproducibility and data sharing are increasingly prioritized at the publication stage, integrating these principles at earlier stages of laboratory research has been hampered by the lack of broadly applicable solutions. Here, we propose that the workflow used in modern software development offers a robust framework for enhancing reproducibility and collaboration in laboratory research. In particular, we show that GitHub, a platform widely used for collaborative software projects, can be effectively adapted to organize and document all aspects of a research project's lifecycle in a molecular biology laboratory. We outline a three-step approach for incorporating the GitHub ecosystem into laboratory research workflows: 1. designing and organizing experiments using issues and project boards, 2. documenting experiments and data analyses with a version control system, and 3. ensuring reproducible software environments for data analyses and writing tasks with containerized packages. The versatility, scalability, and affordability of this approach make it suitable for various scenarios, ranging from small research groups to large, cross-institutional collaborations. Adopting this framework from a project's outset can increase the efficiency and fidelity of knowledge transfer within and across research laboratories. An example GitHub repository based on the above approach is available at https://github.com/rasilab/github_demo.</description>

      <title>Data-centric challenges with the application and adoption of artificial intelligence for drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is exhibiting tremendous potential to reduce the massive costs and long timescales of drug discovery. There are however important challenges currently limiting the impact and scope of AI models.
  Areas covered: Such models excel on benchmarks unlikely to anticipate their prospective performance, which inadvertently misguides their development. In practice, only a few are ever reported to have prospective value (e.g. by discovering potent and innovative drug leads for a therapeutic target). Here we discuss a range of data issues (bias, inconsistency, skewness, irrelevance, small size, high dimensionality), how they challenge AI models and which issue-specific mitigations have been effective. Next, we point out the challenges faced by uncertainty quantification techniques aimed at enhancing these AI models. We also discuss how conceptual errors, unrealistic benchmarks and performance misestimation can confound the evaluation of models and thus their development. Lastly, we explain how human bias, whether from AI experts or drug discovery experts, constitutes another challenge that can be alleviated with prospective studies.
  Expert opinion: We have discussed what can go wrong in practice with AI for drug discovery. We hope that this will help inform the decisions of editors, funders investors and researchers working in this area.</description>
