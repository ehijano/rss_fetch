      <title>D-instanton Effects on a D3-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed by Sen that the D-instanton effects in string theory can be systematically determined through the framework of open-closed string field theory. We apply the latter formalism to analyze the D-instanton corrections to the quantum effective action of a D3-brane in type IIB superstring theory, and determine the leading single and multi-instanton contributions to the $D^4 F^4$ effective coupling which is unprotected by supersymmetry. Notably, while we find that the one-instanton contribution agrees with a conjecture of Green and Gutperle, the multi-instanton contribution disagrees with the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Modified Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of field configurations in gauge theory contain important data about the (generalized) global symmetries of the theory as well as potential inconsistencies in the form of gauge anomalies. In this work we modify the topological classes of Abelian $p$-form fields, generating new global variants of gauge theories. These modifications implement constraints directly on the classifying space of the gauge field and its cohomology classes via homotopy fiber construction. This general approach allows us to investigate the universal effects of the constraints on the conserved global charges encoded in gauge characteristic classes. We further demonstrate that this procedure generically leads to new topological sectors introducing additional global charges and anomalies in the modified gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically (un)safe scattering amplitudes from scratch: a deep dive into the IR jungle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute leading order quantum gravity contributions to a simple scalar scattering amplitude in Asymptotic Safety. Our model admits an analytic treatment so that several subtleties can be analysed. We find that (i) the existence of an asymptotically safe renormalisation group fixed point alone does not imply the boundedness of scattering amplitudes, (ii) gravitational logarithms can dominate the infrared regime of massless theories, (iii) a derivative expansion of the effective action fails quantitatively to predict the correct Wilson coefficients in massless theories, and (iv) standard renormalisation group improvement techniques fail qualitatively to describe the momentum dependence of correlation functions. Only momentum-dependent computations can resolve these issues. For theories that include massive fields, the derivative expansion can work effectively in most cases, but it can still fail for classically marginal couplings, and purely gravitational couplings. We also speculate about an effective realisation of the no-global-symmetries conjecture in Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <title>Metastrings, Metaparticles and Black Hole Thermodynamics: On the Road Towards a Non-singular Black Hole Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic evolution and endpoint of black hole evaporation in the framework of metastring theory and its particle excitations, the metaparticles. Metaparticles arise as zero modes of metastrings propagating on modular (doubled) spacetime and obey a modified dispersion relation exhibiting intrinsic UV/IR mixing controlled by a duality scale mu. Using a generalized Bekenstein argument adapted to metaparticles, we derive quantum-corrected entropy contributions associated with geometric and dual (winding-like) sectors of the underlying phase space.
  When treated independently, these two entropy branches lead to an incomplete thermodynamic description, exhibiting unphysical behavior at small horizon area. We show that consistently treating the metaparticle as a single entangled quantum object -- rather than as two independent sectors -- naturally resolves these pathologies. We propose a pseudo-entangled total entropy that incorporates correlations between the geometric and dual sectors. The reality requirement of the entropy dynamically enforces a minimal horizon area and, equivalently, a minimal effective length scale associated with modular spacetime.
  The resulting black hole thermodynamics exhibits a finite maximal temperature, a divergence of the heat capacity signaling a continuous phase transition, and a shutdown of Hawking radiation through geometric channels, leaving behind a cold, stable remnant. Unlike matter-supported or curvature-bounded regular black holes, the remnant obtained here is non-material and non-geometric in nature, corresponding to a finite modular core of spacetime rather than a dust-filled interior. We compare this scenario with mimetic gravity and other non-singular black hole models, emphasizing the distinct role played by first-class constraints, entropy, and modular geometry in the present framework.</description>

      <title>Bjorken Flow of Holographic R-Charged Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the time evolution of several physical observables for the so-called 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model undergoing Bjorken flow. The 2RCBH model corresponds to a top-down holographic construction describing a strongly interacting conformal fluid defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. Taken together with previous findings for the purely thermal $\mathcal{N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma, and the 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) model, our results for the 2RCBH model provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of far-from-equilibrium correlations between the non-equilibrium holographic entropy defined through the area of the apparent horizon of dynamical bulk black holes, and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the dual boundary quantum field theory. Such correlations are relevant in the pre-hydrodynamic stages of some initial data evolved in time, and seem to hold at least for strongly interacting conformal fluids, be they charged or neutral.</description>

      <title>Note on the Hopf-algebra-based formula of Yang-Mills-Scalar amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the Hopf-algebra-based (HAB) formula of Yang-Mills-Scalar (YMS) amplitudes, which expands a YMS amplitude with massive scalars as a combination of propagator matrices that mix massless scalars corresponding to gluons with the original massive scalars. We propose a recursive formula which conveniently expresses the HAB formula. In this formula, gluons are converted into massless scalars. Thus it expresses a YMS amplitude with massive scalars by amplitudes with fewer gluons, massive scalars and massless scalars. We verify this formula by using soft behavior approach. In the massless limit, the HAB formula turns into expressions for YMS amplitudes with massless scalars which was earlier shown to satisfy an alternative recursive expansion formula. In this note, we show the equivalence of these two distinct approaches through explicit calculation on amplitudes with one and two gluons.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet, Neumann, Mixed and self-dual holography: (self-dual) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of self-dual theories to the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study self-dual Yang-Mills theory (SDYM) and its relation to Yang-Mills theory and to Chalmers-Siegel theory with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. A Fefferman-Graham analysis of SDYM is performed to identify its boundary CFT data. We make a proposal for self-dual holography that defines $3d$ ``self-dual CFTs''. The bulk-to-bulk and boundary-to-bulk propagators for SDYM and for Yang-Mills/Chalmers-Siegel theory with mixed boundary conditions are derived in Feynman and axial gauges. Three- and four-point functions are computed in the spinor-helicity formalism, and the relations among the results in the various theories are clarified. The flat limit and the gauge-(in)dependence of the results are analyzed.</description>

      <title>On the Kalb-Ramond field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a massive Kalb-Ramond field with a general non-minimal coupling to gravity. We first study the theory in flat space-time, taking into account the non-linearities. We show that the coupling with the Ricci scalar gives rise to the strong coupling of the two transverse pseudo-vector degrees of freedom, which are absent in the massless theory. We then show that if the theory is instead coupled to the Ricci tensor or the Riemann tensor, the two tensor modes become strongly coupled in addition to the transverse pseudo-vector modes. We then extend our analysis to homogeneous and isotropic space-time, with vanishing background value of the Kalb-Ramond field. We show that in this case, the couplings with the Ricci and Riemann tensor give rise to the runaway instability. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of the disformal coupling as a possible resolution to this unnatural behavior.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Holographic Analysis of Anomaly-induced Charge Transport in the D3/D7 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to correctly incorporate the contribution of the chiral anomaly in the D3/D7 model to calculate chiral transport phenomena. To ensure the D7-brane wraps S^5 appropriately and the Wess-Zumino term is switched on, we allow the D7-brane to rotate in the compactified extra directions and perform the analysis accordingly. To demonstrate that this calculation procedure works well, we specifically compute the magnetoresistance in the D3/D7 model. We find that a finite axial chemical potential is realized and the negative magnetoresistance is enhanced by the anomaly contribution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interactions in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glavan-Lin proposal for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity introduces a singular dimensional scaling to bypass Lovelock's theorem, though its fundamental origin remains debated. In this work, we demonstrate that this specific dimension-dependent scaling naturally emerges from the one-loop self-energy corrections of gravitons. By employing real-space techniques to evaluate graviton interactions with minimally coupled scalar and electromagnetic fields in a de Sitter background, we show that the $1/(D-4)$ pole universally generates a dynamical Gauss-Bonnet term. This confirms that the scaling is not an ad-hoc classical limit but a necessary consequence of quantum field-theoretic renormalization. Furthermore, canceling the remaining divergences strictly requires the inclusion of quadratic curvature counterterms, specifically Weyl-squared and $R^2$ invariants. We discuss the implications of this in the early-Universe and consequences in strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT Phase Transitions and Criticality for Einstein-Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the thermodynamic phase structure for Anti-de Sitter black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-power-Yang-Mills gravity, reformulated through holographic duality as an ensemble problem in the dual conformal field theory (CFT). By deriving an extended first law where the central charge \(C\) is a thermodynamic variable, we systematically explore both canonical and mixed ensembles. In the canonical ensemble with fixed charges, we identify a van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large black holes, marked by a characteristic swallowtail structure and coexistence curves with a negative slope. In contrast, within the mixed ensemble of fixed electric potential, the system exhibits a Hawking-Page transition between confined and deconfined phases of the boundary CFT. Our key finding is the suppressive role of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills charge \(\tilde{q}\): increasing \(\tilde{q}\) lowers both the minimum and the Hawking-Page transition temperatures, significantly narrowing the stability window of the confined phase. These results, supported by detailed numerical analysis, reveal a rich, ensemble-dependent phase landscape and establish the non-linear Yang-Mills sector as a critical controller of confinement physics in strongly coupled holographic systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady states in driven holographic Weyl semi-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Weyl materials provide a controlled setting for exploring Floquet dynamics in open quantum systems, including nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Motivated by the desire for a strongly-coupled description, we employ holography to analyze the formation and stability of a NESS in a Weyl semi-metal induced by an external circularly polarized electric field. A time-periodic steady-state solution is constructed and its stability is determined from the spectrum of out-of-equilibrium quasinormal modes (Floquet exponents). A stable region in the drive parameter space is identified; beyond a critical curve, the Floquet exponents enter the upper half of the complex plane, leading to a superharmonic response. At sufficiently strong driving, chaotic time evolution emerges in the fully nonlinear initial-boundary value problem. The anomaly-induced response of the NESS to an external magnetic field is also computed, and the resulting behavior is related to the previously proposed chiral pumping effect.</description>

      <title>Spin chains for ADE quiver theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral problem of four-dimensional superconformal quiver gauge theories can be mapped to one-dimensional spin chains with restricted Hilbert spaces, where the composition of neighbouring spins follows the path algebra of the quiver. To better understand such spin chains, we compute the one-loop planar dilatation operator for the 4d N=2 ADE quiver gauge theories obtained by orbifolding the N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory and marginally deforming by independently varying the gauge couplings. This extends previous work which was mainly focused on the Z2 quiver. We characterise the general features of the resulting ADE spin-chain models and construct the 2-magnon Bethe ansatz for holomorphic states. We also evaluate, at large N, the N=2 superconformal index of these gauge theories and use it to study their protected spectrum in specific sectors.</description>

      <title>Time in gravitational subregions and in closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are gauge-invariant local observables in a subregion in quantum gravity? How does one even define such a subregion non-perturbatively? We study these questions in JT gravity. One can define a subregion by specifying the value of the dilaton at the boundary of the region. We study conformal matter correlators in such a subregion. There is a gravitational constraint associated with York time evolution within the causal diamond of the subregion. This constraint can be leveraged to construct gauge-invariant observables in quantum gravity, using a crossed product construction. The extrinsic curvature of Cauchy slices acts as the physical clock. This is a simple example of how gauge-invariant observables can be obtained by dressing to features of a spacetime (or other fields), without the need for introducing an external observer. The entropy associated with this algebra of observables is not an area, or any boundary term. We show that gravitational constraints only give boundary formulas for entropy when gauging isometric diffeomorphisms. York time flow is merely a conformal isometry, not an actual isometry, and thus leads to bulk contributions to entropy. We repeat our construction for Milne-type closed Big-Bang universes, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture a family of matrix quantum mechanical models that are holographically dual to discrete light-cone quantization of M-theory in pp-wave-like backgrounds. These backgrounds can be obtained from a Penrose limit of AdS$_4\times X_7$, where $X_7$ is Einstein. The matrix models arise from a classically consistent dimensional reduction of the UV Lagrangians of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories, in close analogy with how the BMN matrix model is obtained by dimensional reduction from $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss about supersymmetric black objects in pp-wave background by studying the Witten index and speculate that the area of the horizon is bounded from above for a fixed $N$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify one of the most widely studied frameworks to explain the hierarchical structure of the flavor sector in the Standard Model, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, with cosmic inflation. We propose that the complex scalar field, the so-called flavon, which breaks the Froggatt-Nielsen $U(1)$ symmetry and generates the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model, to also drive inflation, which we dub as Inflavon. After inflation ends, the decay of the inflavon reheats the Universe, establishing a novel link between early Universe cosmology and flavor physics. As concrete examples, we present realizations where the inflavon potential is described by an $\alpha$-attractor potential. We then compute the resulting CMB observables, specifically the spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), and the amplitude of scalar perturbations ($A_s$) as functions of the underlying Froggatt-Nielsen model parameters. We identify the parameter space in Froggatt-Nielsen models involving the scale of Flavor symmetry breaking $\Lambda_{\rm FN}$ and FN charges which is ruled out by Planck and ACT data, as well as the region that could be probed by next-generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SO and LiteBIRD. We also discuss inflavon as dark matter and its isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-boosted diffusion: initial value formulation and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the diffusion equation, when treated as a stand-alone partial differential equation, exhibits exponential instabilities in boosted frames, which render the corresponding initial-value problem ill-posed. Recently, however, it was shown that Fick-type diffusion arises as the exact hydrodynamic sector of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. In this work, we exploit this kinetic embedding to formulate a modified initial-value problem for one-dimensional Lorentz-boosted diffusion. We show that the resulting dynamics are well posed both forward and backward in time, provided the boosted density profiles admit a kinetic-theory realization. Such profiles form a space of band-limited functions, within which the evolution can be expressed as a discrete superposition of spatially sampled initial data, weighted by a Shannon-Whittaker-type Green function defined on the full Minkowski plane. The Green function is obtained in closed analytic form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ermakov has shown how the solution to the classical harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension with general time-dependent frequency can be reduced to the time-independent case and an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation, an analysis which has been applied to the Schr\"odinger equation as well. We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from Rotating Charged Black Holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of energy extraction via the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism from rotating charged black holes in the context of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <title>Direction-of-arrival estimation of a gravitational wave by correlations between quadrupole moments of pulsar timings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from pulsar timing array observations? The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past-geodesically-complete cosmologies are thought to require either contraction, or an asymptotically static past. We introduce a third possibility: Einstein-frame time can dynamically attain a local minimum. This time-reversal is caused by phantom Chaplygin gas, whose acoustic cone defines a `causal-frame' geometry that is geodesically-complete. While gravity experiences time-reversal, the Chaplygin gas always evolves forward in time, realizing a transient mismatch in thermodynamic arrows of time. Time-reversal affects the scale-factor, enforcing a non-singular bounce in causal frame that is robust against any additional matter.</description>

      <title>Exact Spinning Morris-Thorne Wormhole: Causal Structure, Shadows, and Multipole Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact spinning generalisation of the Morris-Thorne traversable wormhole supported by an anisotropic fluid. Within the Teo wormhole ansatz with unit lapse and Morris-Thorne shape function, we solve analytically for the frame-dragging function and obtain a two-parameter family of asymptotically flat solutions labelled by the throat radius $r_0$ and total angular momentum $J$. Curvature scalars and stress-energy components are given in closed form, showing a regular throat, equatorial reflection symmetry, and violations of all standard energy conditions, as required for traversable wormholes. We analyse the causal structure and show that, despite the presence of an ergoregion for sufficiently large $|J|$, the coordinate time defines a global temporal function, so the spacetime is stably causal and free of closed timelike curves. The optical appearance is studied via photon trajectories. The resulting shadows are smaller than Kerr's and depend on the wormhole shape. Finally, we compute the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and find a massless but spinning configuration with distinctive higher multipoles that encode the throat scale.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Evolution of Primordial Black Holes to near-extremality in EFTs of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter candidates includes primordial black holes (PBHs) as possible constituents. Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables.</description>

Abstract: We propose an approach to construct three-dimensional lattice models using line defects in state integral models on shaped triangulations of 3-manifolds. The Boltzmann weights for these models satisfy a variant of the tetrahedron equation, which implies integrability under suitable assumptions on R-matrices and transfer matrices. As an explicit example, we present a solution produced by Teichm\"uller TQFT.</description>

      <title>Choice of Quantum Vacuum for Inflation Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modifications to inflationary observables that arise when adopting an $\alpha$-vacuum instead of the standard Bunch--Davies vacuum for quantum fluctuations during inflation. Within the Starobinsky inflationary model, we compute and compare the scalar spectral index, its running, and the running of the running arising from different choices of the initial vacuum state. We further examine the energy scales associated with $\alpha$-vacua and argue that, for any number of extra spatial dimensions, the relevant scale can be truncated at the Hubble scale, $\sim$$\mathcal{O}(10^{13})\,\mathrm{GeV}$, without conflict with current Cavendish-type experimental bounds on sub-millimeter gravity ($\sim$$250\,\mu\mathrm{m}$). Our analysis demonstrates that the $\alpha$-vacuum is subject to stringent constraints as a viable de~Sitter-invariant alternative to the Euclidean (Bunch--Davies) vacuum, with the corrections that it induces in the inflationary observables being strongly limited by the latest Planck data.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we use the gauge/gravity duality to perform the first systematic study of the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a hot and dense far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled relativistic fluid with a critical point. By employing a top-down holographic construction that stems from string theory, we numerically obtain the full nonlinear evolution of the far-from-equilibrium system undergoing a Bjorken expansion and address the following question: how does hydrodynamic behavior emerge in the vicinity of a critical point in the phase diagram? For the top-down holographic system analyzed in the present work, we find that the approach to hydrodynamics is strongly affected by the presence of the critical point: the closer the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature is to its critical value, the longer it takes for the system to be well described by the equations of viscous hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principle in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of non-supersymmetric four dimensional black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

      <title>Homogeneous isotropization dynamics and entropy production in a hot and dense strongly interacting fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy during the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model, corresponding to a top-down holographic fluid defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. In addition to the entropy production, we also analyze the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. When the system is far-from-equilibrium the dominant and weak energy conditions can be transiently violated. For all initial conditions considered, we observe the emergence of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus forming a stairway for the entropy as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The entropy stairway allows for the entropy to encode a periodic structure without violating the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, the complex frequency of the lowest quasinormal mode (QNM) of the system is directly tied to the periodic structure of the entropy stairway, which provides another explicit numerical confirmation of a quite general connection between entropy production and QNMs previously discovered in the literature. Furthermore, when the chemical potential of the 2RCBH fluid exceeds a certain threshold, the pressure anisotropy exhibits a late-time decay governed by a purely imaginary QNM, and as the system is doped with increasing values of R-charge chemical potential the late-time equilibration pattern of the pressure anisotropy gets increasingly deformed, eventually losing the oscillatory behavior observed at lower values of chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Double soft graviton factors from the gravitational Wilson line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of low-energy (``soft") gravitons using universal theorems continues to attract attention. In this paper, we consider the emission of two soft gravitons, using a previously developed formalism that describes (next-to) soft graviton emission in terms of generalised Wilson lines (GWLs). Based on Schwinger's proper time methods, the GWL allows for a systematic accounting of graviton emission from external hard particles in the amplitude, as well as from three-graviton vertices located off the individual worldlines. By combining these effects, previously derived results for the leading double soft graviton theorem are recovered. Still, the formalism allows us to go further in deriving new universal double soft graviton terms at subleading order in the momentum expansion. We further demonstrate how gauge invariance can be utilized to account for double soft graviton emissions within the non-radiative amplitude, including the effects of non-zero initial positions of the hard particles. Our results can be packaged into an exponential dressing operator, and we comment on possible applications to the effective field theory for binary scattering processes.</description>

      <title>On Gauge-Invariant Entire-Function Regulators and UV Finiteness in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the R\'enyi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the proton in the improved holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the gluonic contribution to the gravitational form factors of the proton using the improved holographic QCD model, in which the proton is described in terms of bulk Dirac fermions. Model parameters are constrained using lattice and phenomenological input, allowing us to obtain estimates for the gravitational form factors and to compare them with results from other approaches. The resulting gluonic contribution to the $\mathcal{D}(t)$ form factor is found to exhibit an infrared pole in our framework. Using the extracted form factors, we analyze mechanical properties of the proton, including pressure and shear distributions. We obtain estimates of $\rho_{\text{mech}} = 0.95$ fm and $\rho_{\text{mass}} = 0.61$ fm for the mechanical and the mass radii of the proton, respectively, which are similar to other nonperturbative studies.</description>

      <title>Nonanalytic Structure of Effective Potential at Finite Temperature on Compactified Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We thoroughly investigate nonanalytic terms in the finite-temperature effective potential in one-loop approximation on a $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}\times R^{D-(p+1)}\times \prod_{i=1}^p S_i^1$, using a mode recombination formula. Such nonanalytic terms cannot be expressed as positive powers of field-dependent mass squared. The formula provides a clear separation of the effective potential into a part that contains the nonanalytic terms and a part that is purely analytic, and clarifies the origin of the nonanalytic terms. We obtain all the nonanalytic terms and show that only two types of nonanalytic terms arise from the modes with zero Matsubara frequency. For a real scalar field with periodic boundary conditions, if the number of noncompacted spatial dimensions is odd (even), there are odd powers of $M$ ($\log M$ terms) but no $\log M$ terms (no odd powers of $M$). For fermions with general boundary conditions, we find that neither of the two types appears. These results clarify the nonanalytic structure of the finite-temperature effective potential on the spacetime with compactified spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Realization of Carrollian Conformal Symmetry and Celestial Holography Indications through Deformed Light-Cone Null Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the deformed light-cone formalism to investigate the Carrollian version of a complex vector field theory. We find that after applying the null-reduction procedure and the Carrollian limit $c\rightarrow 0$, the "-" null-direction and spatial components of the parent vector field decouple completely into independent scalar fields, while the "+" null-direction component vanishes. We carefully derive and demonstrate the process by which the energy-momentum tensor degrades from the Lorentzian symmetry case to the non-relativistic scenario, and point out that the secondary constraint of the original parent theory will play a crucial role in the derivation of the Carrollian generators. As expected, the resulting generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations. Furthermore, leveraging the $U(1)$ global symmetry of the Carrollian theory, we derived Weinberg's famous leading Soft Photon Theorem roughly and schematically via celestial holography. However, due to the non-interacting nature of our Carrollian theory, leading Soft Photon Theorem serves as an example of the triviality of the bulk description in the infrared limit. In the end, based on the celestial holographic dictionary, we discuss the holographic properties of our Carrollian theory and identify three distinct limitations. Our analysis deepens the understanding of the holographic properties of Carrollian theories realized via deformed light-cone null reduction, laying the foundation for the further development of this methodology.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing one-loop vacuum energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of non-supersymmetric type II toroidal asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing vacuum energy at one-loop in string perturbation theory. These are engineered through the conservation of a supercharge-like operator in each individual sector in the orbifold sum, despite the overall explicit breaking of spacetime SUSY. We provide a full classification of such orbifolds with finite Abelian point-group, which can only admit $\mathbb{Z}_k \times \mathbb{Z}_k$ point group with $k=2,3,4$. We present detailed constructions, alongside other examples with non-Abelian point group. For some of these models, it is possible that this cancellation persists at higher loops.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight truncation, graded EFT structure, and renormalization of black hole Love numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static tidal Love numbers of four-dimensional black holes vanish identically, unlike their nontrivial dynamical response at finite frequency. Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.</description>

      <title>Is Quadratic Gravity ghost free because the ghost is only virtual?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{salvio} a prescription for calculating the correlation functions in Quadratic Gravity \cite{stelle1}-\cite{stelle2} was presented. This procedure does not enter in conflict with unitarity The Gauss-Ostrogradsky method for higher order theories defines two momentum densities $P_1$ and $P_2$ and two coordinate densities $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, one pair is standard, the other ghost like. The approach in \cite{salvio} involves the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$ of the ghost variables. In the present work, following \cite{yomismo}, the LSZ rules are derived, but with a formalism adapted to full quartic or higher order theories. The hypothesis for quantization are that $[Q_1, Q_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$, $[P_1, P_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$ and $[P_1, Q_1]=iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$. This alone leads to the conclusion that $[P_2, Q_2]=-iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$, therefore this last pair of variables is ghost like. The graviton contains a massless mode, which is the standard graviton, plus two massive modes with masses $m_2$ and $m_3$. The third mode is usually interpreted as a ghost in the literature \cite{stelle2}. Here it is shown that, even after making the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$, the creation and annihilation operators for this mode commute, the third mode does not appear as a free wave. This does not invalidate the model. The effective action $\Gamma$ can be calculated following \cite{stelle1}, and can be constrained by the Slavnov-Taylor identities \cite{Slavnov}-\cite{Taylor}, and the scattering rules may be worked out consequently.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics Positivity Bound from 3-Form Black Holes and Inflation with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the thermodynamics positivity bounds and slow-roll inflation within a framework governed by a 3-form gauge field. Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that thermodynamic consistency can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We find that, among the configurations studied, networks with a $15$ km triangular ET design provide the strongest parity-violation constraining power, followed by networks with an L-shaped ET design, while networks with $10$ km triangular ET configurations are the least sensitive. Under current bounds, ET alone cannot confidently detect parity violation.</description>
