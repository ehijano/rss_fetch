      <title>Adaptive mesh refinement on Cartesian meshes applied to the mixed finite element discretization of the multigroup neutron diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multigroup neutron diffusion equations are often used to model the neutron density at the nuclear reactor core scale. Classically, these equations can be recast in a mixed variational form. This chapter presents an adaptive mesh refinement approach based on a posteriori estimators. We focus on refinement strategies on Cartesian meshes, since such structures are common for nuclear reactor core applications.</description>

      <title>Mixing Condition Numbers and Oracles for Accurate Floating-point Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have made numeric debugging tools much faster by using double-double oracles, and numeric analysis tools much more accurate by using condition numbers. But these techniques have downsides: double-double oracles have correlated error so miss floating-point errors while condition numbers cannot cleanly handle over- and under- flow. We combine both techniques to avoid these downsides. Our combination, EXPLANIFLOAT, computes condition numbers using double-double arithmetic, which avoids correlated errors. To handle over- and under- flow, it introduces a separate logarithmic oracle. As a result, EXPLANIFLOAT achieves a precision of 80.0% and a recall of 96.1% on a collection of 546 difficult numeric benchmarks: more accurate than double-double oracles yet dramatically faster than arbitrary-precision condition number computations.</description>

      <title>An Acoustic Inversion-Based Flow Measurement Model in 3D Hydrodynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the flow measurement method initially proposed in [22] to three-dimensional scenarios, addressing the growing need for accurate and efficient non-contact flow measurement techniques in complex hydrodynamic environments. Compared to conventional Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and remote sensing-based flow monitoring, the proposed method enables high-resolution, continuous water velocity measurement, making it well-suited for hazardous environments such as floods, strong currents, and sediment-laden rivers. Building upon the original approach, we develop an enhanced model that incorporates multiple emission directions and flexible configurations of receivers. These advancements improve the adaptability and accuracy of the method when applied to three-dimensional flow fields. To evaluate its feasibility, we conducted extensive numerical simulations designed to mimic real-world hydrodynamic conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively handles diverse and complex flow field configurations, highlighting its potential for practical applications in water resource management and hydraulic engineering.</description>

      <title>Solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems via contour integration and region partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine Beyn's method and the recently developed recursive integral method (RIM) to propose a contour integral-based, region partitioning eigensolver for nonlinear eigenvalue problems. A new partitioning criterion is employed to eliminate the need for a problem-dependent parameter, making our algorithm much more robust compared to the original RIM. Moreover, our algorithm can be directly applied to regions containing singularities or accumulation points, which are typically challenging for existing nonlinear eigensolvers to handle. Comprehensive numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is particularly well suited for dealing with regions including many eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>A numerical method based on quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi cells for two-phase flows with large density contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use a moving Voronoi and sharp interface approach for simulating two-phase flows. At every time step, the mesh is generated anew from Voronoi seeds that behave as material points. The paper is a continuation of our previous works on moving Voronoi meshes where we have considered single phase incompressible and compressible flows. In the context of quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi simulations, problems with large density contrasts (such as water and air interface) are being treated here for the first time to the best of our knowledge. This is made possible through a remapping stage, which relies on a filtering of a color function. The resulting semi-implicit scheme is conservative and robust, allowing us to simulate both compressible and incompressible flows, including shock waves and surface tension.</description>

      <title>The Exact Geometry of Numerical Error: Cyclic Groups and Deterministic Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Universal Bias Framework (UBF) introduces a novel perspective on numerical integration errors for periodic $C^2[0,1]$ functions evaluated on uniform grids. We prove that within this domain, what has traditionally been treated through asymptotic bounds is in fact a deterministic signal governed by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/P\mathbb{Z}$. For \[ f(x)=\sin^2(2\pi kx) \] on a uniform grid of $P$ points, we derive the exact bias formula: \[ \mathcal{B}_P[f] = -\frac{1}{2}\chi\left(\frac{2k}{P}\right) + \frac{\sin(4\pi k)}{8\pi k}, \] where $\chi$ functions as a resonance detector, encoding grid-frequency interactions -- spiking at integer ratios of $k/P$ and vanishing at partial resonances. This is not an approximation; it is an exact solution validated to machine precision ($10^{-16}$).
  For periodic $C^2[0,1]$ functions, the bias exhibits a fractal-like structure at rational $k/P$ values, with resonance peaks organised in a Farey fraction hierarchy. This establishes a connection between numerical error and number theory, unifying integration and spectral analysis through a common algebraic structure.
  The framework's predictive power extends to real-world applications -- our analysis shows it could have anticipated the error accumulation in the 1991 Patriot missile failure 61 hours before the critical threshold. UBF provides a foundation for precise error prediction in domains where periodic functions on uniform grids are relevant, including signal processing, quantum simulation, and computational mechanics, transforming error from an obstacle to be bounded into a signal to be leveraged.</description>

      <title>A Lagrange multiplier formulation for the fully dynamic Navier-Stokes-Biot system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of fluid -- poroelastic structure interaction and its numerical solution. The free fluid region is governed by the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the poroelastic region is modeled by the Biot system of poroelasticity. The two systems are coupled along an interface through continuity of normal velocity and stress and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman slip with friction condition. The variables in the weak formulation are velocity and pressure for Navier-Stokes, displacement for elasticity and velocity and pressure for Darcy flow. A Lagrange multiplier of stress/pressure type is employed to impose weakly the continuity of flux. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of a weak solution is established under a small data assumption. A fully discrete numerical method is then developed, based on backward Euler time discretization and finite element spatial approximation. We establish solvability, stability, and error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical results and illustrate the performance of the method for an arterial flow application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the Born and inverse Born approximation and series to recover two function-valued coefficients in the Helmholtz equation for inverse scattering problems from the scattering data at two different frequencies. An analysis of the convergence and approximation error of the proposed regularized inverse Born series is provided. The results show that the proposed series converges when the inverse Born approximations of the perturbations are sufficiently small. The preliminary numerical results show the capability of the proposed regularized inverse Born approximation and series for recovering the isotropic inhomogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based method for conjugate heat transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical approach for solving conjugate heat transfer problems using the finite volume method. This approach combines a semi-implicit scheme for fluid flow, governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with an optimization-based approach for heat transfer across the fluid-solid interface. In the semi-implicit method, the convective term in the momentum equation is treated explicitly, ensuring computational efficiency, while maintaining stability when a CFL condition involving fluid velocity is satisfied. Heat exchange between the fluid and solid domains is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is efficiently solved using a sequential quadratic programming method. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A free parameter depending family of polynomial wavelets on a compact interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact interval, we introduce and study a whole family of wavelets depending on a free parameter that can be suitably modulated to improve performance. Such wavelets arise from de la Vall\'ee Poussin (VP) interpolation at Chebyshev nodes, generalizing previous work by Capobianco and Themistoclakis who considered a special parameter setting. In our construction, both scaling and wavelet functions are interpolating polynomials at some Chebyshev zeros of 1st kind. Contrarily to the classical approach, they are not generated by dilations and translations of a single mother function and are naturally defined on the interval $[-1,1]$ to which any other compact interval can be reduced. In the paper, we provide a non-standard multiresolution analysis with fast (DCT-based) decomposition and reconstruction algorithms. Moreover, we state several theoretical results, particularly on convergence, laying the foundation for future applications.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Family of Polynomial Wavelets for Signal and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential applications of a parametric family of polynomial wavelets that has been recently introduced starting from de la Vall\'ee Poussin (VP) interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. Unlike classical wavelets, which are constructed on the real line, these VP wavelets are defined on a bounded interval, offering the advantage of handling boundaries naturally while maintaining computational efficiency. In fact, the structure of these wavelets enables the use of fast algorithms for decomposition and reconstruction. Furthermore, the flexibility offered by a free parameter allows a better control of localized singularities, such as edges in images. On the basis of previous theoretical foundations, we show the effectiveness of the VP wavelets for basic signal denoising and image compression, emphasizing their potential for more advanced signal and image processing tasks.</description>

      <title>On Local Minimum Entropy Principle of High-Order Schemes for Relativistic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the minimum entropy principle (MEP) for the relativistic Euler equations with a broad class of equations of state (EOSs) and addresses the challenge of preserving the local version of the discovered MEP in high-order numerical schemes. At the continuous level, we find out a family of entropy pairs for the relativistic Euler equations and provide rigorous analysis to prove the strict convexity of entropy under a necessary and sufficient condition. At the numerical level, we develop a rigorous framework for designing provably entropy-preserving high-order schemes that ensure both physical admissibility and the discovered MEP. The relativistic effects, coupled with the abstract and general EOS formulation, introduce significant challenges not encountered in the nonrelativistic case or with the ideal EOS. In particular, entropy is a highly nonlinear and implicit function of the conservative variables, making it particularly difficult to enforce entropy preservation. To address these challenges, we establish a series of auxiliary theories via highly technical inequalities. Another key innovation is the use of geometric quasi-linearization (GQL), which reformulates the nonlinear constraints into equivalent linear ones by introducing additional free parameters. These advancements form the foundation of our entropy-preserving analysis. We propose novel, robust, locally entropy-preserving high-order frameworks. A central challenge is accurately estimating the local minimum of entropy, particularly in the presence of shock waves at unknown locations. To address this, we introduce two new approaches for estimating local lower bounds of specific entropy, which prove effective for both smooth and discontinuous problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our entropy-preserving methods maintain high-order accuracy while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>Oscillation-eliminating central DG schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a class of essentially non-oscillatory central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) methods for general hyperbolic conservation laws. First, we introduce a novel compact, non-oscillatory stabilization mechanism that effectively suppresses spurious oscillations while preserving the high-order accuracy of CDG methods. Unlike existing limiter-based approaches that rely on large stencils or problem-specific parameters for oscillation control, our dual damping mechanism is inspired by CDG-based numerical dissipation and leverages overlapping solutions within the CDG framework, significantly enhancing stability while maintaining compactness. Our approach is free of problem-dependent parameters and complex characteristic decomposition, making it efficient and robust. Second, we provide a rigorous stability and optimal error analysis for fully discrete Runge-Kutta (RK) CDG schemes, addressing a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods. Specifically, we establish the approximate skew-symmetry and weak boundedness of the CDG discretization. These results enable us to rigorously analyze the fully discrete error estimates for our oscillation-eliminating CDG (OECDG) method, a challenging task due to its nonlinear nature, even for linear advection equations. Building on this framework, we reformulate nonlinear oscillation-eliminating CDG schemes as linear RK CDG schemes with a nonlinear source term, extending error estimates beyond the linear case to schemes with nonlinear oscillation control. While existing error analyses for DG or CDG schemes have largely been restricted to linear cases without nonlinear oscillation-control techniques, our analysis represents an important theoretical advancement. Experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OECDG method.</description>

      <title>Stable Volume Dissipation for High-Order Finite-Difference Methods with the Generalized Summation-by-Parts Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of stable, conservative, and accurate volume dissipation is extended to discretizations that possess a generalized summation-by-parts (SBP) property within a tensor-product framework. The dissipation operators can be readily applied to any scheme that uses the SBP framework, including high-order entropy-stable schemes. Additionally, we clarify the incorporation of a variable coefficient within the operator structure and analyze the impact of a boundary correction matrix on operator structure and accuracy. Following the theoretical development and construction of novel dissipation operators, we relate the presented volume dissipation to the use of upwind SBP operators. While we focus on finite-difference methods, our framework also applies to spectral-element methods, in which case we obtain unique dissipation operators that can also be derived through alternative approaches involving orthogonal polynomials. Numerical examples featuring the linear convection, Burgers, and Euler equations verify the properties of the constructed dissipation operators and assess their performance compared to existing upwind SBP schemes, including linear stability behaviour. We demonstrate that the presented approach is a competitive option for adding volume dissipation in a manner compatible with existing entropy-stable SBP schemes.</description>

      <title>Neural network-enhanced $hr$-adaptive finite element algorithm for parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel enhancement to the conventional $hr$-adaptive finite element methods for parabolic equations, integrating traditional $h$-adaptive and $r$-adaptive methods via neural networks. A major challenge in $hr$-adaptive finite element methods lies in projecting the previous step's finite element solution onto the updated mesh. This projection depends on the new mesh and must be recomputed for each adaptive iteration. To address this, we introduce a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate of the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is mesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters initialized using the optimizer from the previous time step. This approach effectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested meshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and efficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZING and GENERATE, allowing each refinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration and then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the singularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated refinement and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven space-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of singularities.</description>

      <title>A fast Fourier spectral method for wave kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central object in wave turbulence theory is the wave kinetic equation (WKE), which is an evolution equation for wave action density and acts as the wave analog of the Boltzmann kinetic equations for particle interactions. Despite recent exciting progress in the theoretical aspects of the WKE, numerical developments have lagged behind. In this paper, we introduce a fast Fourier spectral method for solving the WKE. The key idea lies in reformulating the high-dimensional nonlinear wave kinetic operator as a spherical integral, analogous to classical Boltzmann collision operator. The conservation of mass and momentum leads to a double convolution structure in Fourier space, which can be efficiently handled using the fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method through several numerical tests in both 2D and 3D, revealing some interesting and unique features of this equation.</description>

      <title>TR-Based Antenna Design with Forward FD: the Effects of Step Size on the Optimization Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods are important tools for design of modern antennas. Trust-region (TR) methods coupled with data-efficient surrogates based on finite differentiation (FD) represent a popular class of antenna design algorithms. However, TR performance is subject to FD setup, which is normally determined a priori based on rules-of-thumb. In this work, the effect of FD perturbations on the performance of TR-based design is evaluated on a case study basis concerning a total of 80 optimizations of a planar antenna structure. The obtained results demonstrate that, for the considered radiator, the performance of the final designs obtained using different FD setups may vary by as much as 18 dB (and by over 4 dB on average). At the same time, the a priori perturbations in a range between 1.5% and 3% (w.r.t. the initial design) seem to be suitable for maintaining (relatively) consistent and high-quality results.</description>

      <title>Specification-Oriented Automatic Design of Topologically Agnostic Antenna Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of antennas for modern applications is a challenging task that combines cognition-driven development of topology intertwined with tuning of its parameters using rigorous numerical optimization. However, the process can be streamlined by neglecting the engineering insight in favor of automatic de-termination of structure geometry. In this work, a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antenna is considered. The radiator is developed using a bi-stage algorithm that involves min-max classification of randomly-generated topologies followed by local tuning of the promising designs using a trust-region optimization applied to a feature-based representation of the structure frequency response. The automatically generated antenna is characterized by -10 dB bandwidth of over 600 MHz w.r.t. the center frequency of 6.5 GHz and a dual-lobe radiation pattern. The obtained performance figures make the radiator of use for in-door positioning applications. The design method has been favorably compared against the frequency-based trust-region optimization.</description>

      <title>Miniaturization-Oriented Design of Spline-Parameterized UWB Antenna for In-Door Positioning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of ultra-wideband antennas for in-door localization applications is a challenging task that involves development of geometry that ensures appropriate balance between the size and performance. In this work, a topologically-flexible monopole has been generated using a stratified framework which embeds a gradient-based trust-region (TR) optimization algorithm in a meta-loop that gradually increases structure dimensionality. The optimization has been performed using a composite objective function that maintains acceptable size/performance trade-off. The final design features a reflection below -10 dB within the UWB spectrum and a small footprint of only 182 mm2. The considered method has been benchmarked against a standard TR-based routine executed directly on a multi-dimensional representation of the antenna model.</description>

      <title>Localized Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Temporally Adaptive Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for predicting the future states of dynamical systems. However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong short-term forecasting capabilities with time-domain decomposition techniques. Our approach segments the time domain of the dynamical system, independently constructing snapshot matrices and performing localized predictions within each segment. We first introduce a localized DMD method with predefined partitioning, which is simple to implement, and then extend it to an adaptive partitioning strategy that enhances prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for our method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to four benchmark problems: Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that our method significantly improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Preserving invariant domains and strong approximation of stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop numerical methods for solving Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with solutions that evolve within a hypercube $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our approach is based on a convex combination of two numerical flows, both of which are constructed from positivity preserving methods. The strong convergence of the Euler version of the method is proven to be of order $\tfrac{1}{2}$, and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that, in some cases, first-order convergence is observed in practice. We compare the Euler and Milstein versions of these new methods to existing domain preservation methods in the literature and observe our methods are robust, more widely applicable and that the error constant is in most cases superior.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of the Strang splitting for the 3D semilinear wave equation with finite-energy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Strang splitting for the time integration of the semilinear wave equation under the finite-energy condition on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$. In the case of a cubic nonlinearity, we show almost second-order convergence in $L^2$ and almost first-order convergence in $H^1$. If the nonlinearity has a quartic form instead, we show an analogous convergence result with an order reduced by 1/2. To our knowledge these are the best convergence results available for the 3D cubic and quartic wave equations under the finite-energy condition. Our approach relies on continuous- and discrete-time Strichartz estimates. We also make use of the integration and summation by parts formulas to exploit cancellations in the error terms. Moreover, error bounds for a full discretization using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space are given. Finally, we discuss a numerical example indicating the sharpness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite element solutions to optimization problems, where the state depends on the possibly constrained control through a linear partial differential equation. Basing upon a reduced and rescaled optimality system, we derive a posteriori bounds capturing the approximation of the state, the adjoint state, the control and the observation. The upper and lower bounds show a gap, which grows with decreasing cost or Tikhonov regularization parameter. This growth is mitigated compared to previous results and can be countered by refinement if control and observation involve compact operators. Numerical results illustrate these properties for model problems with distributed and boundary control.</description>

      <title>The deep multi-FBSDE method: a robust deep learning method for coupled FBSDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based Godunov corrections for approximate Riemann solvers using bi-fidelity learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann problem is fundamental in the computational modeling of hyperbolic partial differential equations, enabling the development of stable and accurate upwind schemes. While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian identification of material parameters in viscoelastic structures as an inverse problem in a semigroup setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article considers the nonlinear inverse problem of identifying the material parameters in viscoelastic structures based on a generalized Maxwell model. The aim is to reconstruct the model parameters from stress data acquired from a relaxation experiment, where the number of Maxwell elements, and thus the number of material parameters themselves, are assumed to be unknown. This implies that the forward operator acts on a Cartesian product of a semigroup (of integers) and a Hilbert space and demands for an extension of existing regularization theory. We develop a stable reconstruction procedure by applying Bayesian inversion to this setting. We use an appropriate binomial prior which takes the integer setting for the number of Maxwell elements into account and at the same time computes the underlying material parameters. We extend the regularization theory for inverse problems to this special setup and prove existence, stability and convergence of the computed solution. The theoretical results are evaluated by extensive numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Numerical Hopf-Lax formulae for Hamilton-Jacobi equations on unstructured geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scheme of Semi-Lagrangian (SL) type for the numerical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation on unstructured triangular grids. As it is well known, SL schemes are not well suited for unstructured grids, due to the cost of the point location phase; this drawback is augmented by the need for repeated minimization. In this work, we propose a scheme that works only on the basis of node values and connectivity of the grid. In a first version, we obtain a monotone scheme; then, applying a quadratic refinement to the numerical solution, we improve accuracy at the price of some extra computational cost. The scheme can be applied to both time-dependent and stationary HJ equations; in the latter case, we also study the construction of a fast policy iteration solver. We perform a theoretical analysis of the two versions, and validate them with an extensive set of examples, both in the time-dependent and in the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient $R^2$ on Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data with a linear trend, it is important to note that, in some cases, they may encounter overfitting issues during the training phase, which could result in negative values of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ for unseen data. For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.</description>

      <title>Improving Wolbachia-Based Control Programs in Urban Settings: Insights from Spatial Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arboviral diseases remain a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. One promising strategy to curb transmission is the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces their ability to spread viruses. However, past large-scale releases have not always been successful, especially in complex urban settings, where restricted access to certain areas often leads to infection establishment failures and wasted resources. To address this, we developed and analyzed a partial differential equation model that simulates how Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are established in different urban environments. We also explored strategies to improve their success under constraints on release size and the efficacy level of insecticide used for pre-release interventions. Our findings suggest that targeted releases are most effective in areas with limited mosquito movement without additional insecticide use. In higher mosquito dispersal areas, reducing at least 35% of wild mosquitoes before release significantly improves establishment within nine months. Additionally, distributing releases over 2-5 weekly batches enhances success more than a single large release, even without other interventions. These findings offer practical insights for designing cost-effective and efficient Wolbachia-based mosquito control programs, reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases on vulnerable communities.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering for nonlinear model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal control for partially observed dynamical systems. Despite its prevalence in practical applications, there are still very few algorithms available, which take uncertainties in the current state estimates and future observations into account. In other words, most current approaches separate state estimation from the optimal control problem. In this paper, we extend the popular ensemble Kalman filter to receding horizon optimal control problems in the spirit of nonlinear model predictive control. We provide an interacting particle approximation to the forward-backward stochastic differential equations arising from Pontryagin's maximum principle with the forward stochastic differential equation provided by the time-continuous ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter equations. The receding horizon control laws are approximated as linear and are continuously updated as in nonlinear model predictive control. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology for an inverted pendulum example.</description>

      <title>Finite Samples for Shallow Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of finite samples to identify two-layer irreducible shallow networks with various nonlinear activation functions, including rectified linear units (ReLU) and analytic functions such as the logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent. An ``irreducible" network is one whose function cannot be represented by another network with fewer neurons. For ReLU activation functions, we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining the irreducibility of a network. Subsequently, we prove a negative result: finite samples are insufficient for definitive identification of any irreducible ReLU shallow network. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that for a given irreducible network, one can construct a finite set of sampling points that can distinguish it from other network with the same neuron count. Conversely, for logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions, we provide a positive result. We construct finite samples that enable the recovery of two-layer irreducible shallow analytic networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the exact identification of two-layer irreducible networks using finite sample function values. Our findings provide insights into the comparative performance of networks with different activation functions under limited sampling conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to solving unconstrained nonlinear optimal control problems for a broad class of dynamical systems. This approach involves lifting the nonlinear problem to a linear ``super-problem'' on a dual Banach space, followed by a non-standard ``exact'' variational analysis, -- culminating in a descent method that achieves rapid convergence with minimal iterations. We investigate the applicability of this framework to mean-field control and discuss its perspectives for the analysis of information propagation in self-interacting neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a parameter-free and efficient method to tackle the structure-texture image decomposition problem. In particular, we present a neural network LPR-NET based on the unrolling of the Low Patch Rank model. On the one hand, this allows us to automatically learn parameters from data, and on the other hand to be computationally faster while obtaining qualitatively similar results compared to traditional iterative model-based methods. Moreover, despite being trained on synthetic images, numerical experiments show the ability of our network to generalize well when applied to natural images.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript is dedicated to the numerical approximation of super-linear slow-fast stochastic differential equations (SFSDEs). Borrowing the heterogeneous multiscale idea, we propose an explicit multiscale Euler-Maruyama scheme suitable for SFSDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients using an appropriate truncation technique. By the averaging principle, we establish the strong convergence of the numerical solutions to the exact solutions in the pth moment. Additionally, under lenient conditions on the coefficients, we also furnish a strong error estimate. In conclusion, we give two illustrative examples and accompanying numerical simulations to affirm the theoretical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Randomized Householder-Cholesky QR Factorization with Multisketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CholeskyQR2 and shifted CholeskyQR3 are two state-of-the-art algorithms for computing tall-and-skinny QR factorizations since they attain high performance on current computer architectures. However, to guarantee stability, for some applications, CholeskyQR2 faces a prohibitive restriction on the condition number of the underlying matrix to factorize. Shifted CholeskyQR3 is stable but has $50\%$ more computational and communication costs than CholeskyQR2. In this paper, a randomized QR algorithm called Randomized Householder-Cholesky (\texttt{rand\_cholQR}) is proposed and analyzed. Using one or two random sketch matrices, it is proved that with high probability, its orthogonality error is bounded by a constant of the order of unit roundoff for any numerically full-rank matrix, and hence it is as stable as shifted CholeskyQR3. An evaluation of the performance of \texttt{rand\_cholQR} on a NVIDIA A100 GPU demonstrates that for tall-and-skinny matrices, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} with multiple sketch matrices is nearly as fast as, or in some cases faster than, CholeskyQR2. Hence, compared to CholeskyQR2, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} is more stable with almost no extra computational or memory cost, and therefore a superior algorithm both in theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Reductions for the Boundary Feedback Stabilization of Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetizable piezoelectric beams exhibit strong couplings between mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields, significantly affecting their high-frequency vibrational behavior. Ensuring exponential stability under boundary feedback controllers is challenging due to the uneven distribution of high-frequency eigenvalues in standard Finite Difference models. While numerical filtering can mitigate instability as the discretization parameter tends to zero, its reliance on explicit spectral computations is computationally demanding. This work introduces two novel model reduction techniques for stabilizing magnetizable piezoelectric beams. First, a Finite Element discretization using linear splines is developed, improving numerical stability over standard Finite Differences. However, this method still requires numerical filtering to eliminate spurious high-frequency modes, necessitating full spectral decomposition. Numerical investigations further reveal a direct dependence of the optimal filtering threshold on feedback amplifiers. To overcome these limitations, an alternative order-reduction Finite Difference scheme is proposed, eliminating the need for numerical filtering. Using a Lyapunov-based framework, we establish exponential stability with decay rates independent of the discretization parameter. The reduced model also exhibits exponential error decay and uniform energy convergence to the original system. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and we construct an algorithm for separating eigenpairs for the proper application of the numerical filtering. Comparative spectral analyses and energy decay results confirm the superior stability and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a robust framework for model reduction in coupled partial differential equation systems.</description>

      <title>CholeskyQR with Randomization and Pivoting for Tall Matrices (CQRRPT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes a new algorithm for QR decomposition with column pivoting (QRCP) of rectangular matrices with many more rows than columns. The algorithm carefully combines methods from randomized numerical linear algebra to accelerate pivot decisions for the input matrix and the process of decomposing the pivoted matrix into the QR form. The source of the latter improvement is CholeskyQR with randomized preconditioning. Comprehensive analysis is provided in both exact and finite-precision arithmetic to characterize the algorithm's rank-revealing properties and its numerical stability granted probabilistic assumptions of the sketching operator. An implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and made available inside the open-source RandLAPACK library, which itself relies on RandBLAS. Experiments with this implementation on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPU demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over LAPACK's standard function for QRCP, and comparable performance to a specialized algorithm for unpivoted QR of tall matrices, which lacks the strong rank-revealing properties of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a stabilized space--time method for the monodomain equation coupled with the Rogers--McCulloch ionic model, which is widely used to simulate electrophysiological wave propagation in the cardiac tissue. By extending the Spline Upwind method and exploiting low-rank matrix approximations, as well as preconditioned solvers, we achieve both significant computational efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we develop a formulation that is both simple and highly effective, designed to minimize spurious oscillations and ensuring computational efficiency. We rigorously validate the method's performance through a series of numerical experiments, showing its robustness and reliability in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unconditional full linear convergence and optimal complexity of adaptive iteratively linearized FEM for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive iteratively linearized finite element method (AILFEM) in the context of strongly monotone nonlinear operators in Hilbert spaces. The approach combines adaptive mesh-refinement with an energy-contractive linearization scheme (e.g., the Ka\v{c}anov method) and a norm-contractive algebraic solver (e.g., an optimal geometric multigrid method). Crucially, a novel parameter-free algebraic stopping criterion is designed and we prove that it leads to a uniformly bounded number of algebraic solver steps. Unlike available results requiring sufficiently small adaptivity parameters to ensure even plain convergence, the new AILFEM algorithm guarantees full R-linear convergence for arbitrary adaptivity parameters. Thus, parameter-robust convergence is guaranteed. Moreover, for sufficiently small adaptivity parameters, the new adaptive algorithm guarantees optimal complexity, i.e., optimal convergence rates with respect to the overall computational cost and, hence, time.</description>

      <title>Space-time parallel scaling of Parareal with a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator coarse propagator applied to the Black-Scholes equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative parallel-in-time algorithms like Parareal can extend scaling beyond the saturation of purely spatial parallelization when solving initial value problems. However, they require the user to build coarse models to handle the inevitably serial transport of information in time.This is a time consuming and difficult process since there is still only limited theoretical insight into what constitutes a good and efficient coarse model. Novel approaches from machine learning to solve differential equations could provide a more generic way to find coarse level models for parallel-in-time algorithms. This paper demonstrates that a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (PINO) is an effective coarse model for the parallelization in time of the two-asset Black-Scholes equation using Parareal. We demonstrate that PINO-Parareal converges as fast as a bespoke numerical coarse model and that, in combination with spatial parallelization by domain decomposition, it provides better overall speedup than both purely spatial parallelization and space-time parallelizaton with a numerical coarse propagator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of graphs, hypergraphs are widely used to model higher-order relations in data. This paper explores the benefit of the hypergraph structure for the interpolation of point cloud data that contain no explicit structural information. We define the $\varepsilon_n$-ball hypergraph and the $k_n$-nearest neighbor hypergraph on a point cloud and study the $p$-Laplacian regularization on the hypergraphs. We prove the variational consistency between the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization and the continuum $p$-Laplacian regularization in a semisupervised setting when the number of points $n$ goes to infinity while the number of labeled points remains fixed. A key improvement compared to the graph case is that the results rely on weaker assumptions on the upper bound of $\varepsilon_n$ and $k_n$. To solve the convex but non-differentiable large-scale optimization problem, we utilize the stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Numerical experiments on data interpolation verify that the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization outperforms the graph $p$-Laplacian regularization in preventing the development of spikes at the labeled points.</description>

      <title>SOC-MartNet: A Martingale Neural Network for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation without Explicit inf H in Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a martingale-based neural network, SOC-MartNet, for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations where no explicit expression is needed for the infimum of the Hamiltonian, $\inf_{u \in U} H(t,x,u, z,p)$, and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. We reformulate the HJB equations for the value function by training two neural networks, one for the value function and one for the optimal control with the help of two stochastic processes - a Hamiltonian process and a cost process. The control and value networks are trained such that the associated Hamiltonian process is minimized to satisfy the minimum principle of a feedback SOCP, and the cost process becomes a martingale, thus, ensuring the value function network as the solution to the corresponding HJB equation. Moreover, to enforce the martingale property for the cost process, we employ an adversarial network and construct a loss function characterizing the projection property of the conditional expectation condition of the martingale. Numerical results show that the proposed SOC-MartNet is effective and efficient for solving HJB-type equations and SOCPs with a dimension up to 10,000 in a small number of iteration steps (less than 6000) of training.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimation of an interior penalty virtual element method for a fourth-order hemivariational inequality in Kirchhoff plate problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a residual-type a posteriori error estimation for an interior penalty virtual element method (IPVEM) for the Kirchhoff plate bending problem. Building on the work in \cite{FY2023IPVEM}, we adopt a modified discrete variational formulation that incorporates the $ H^1 $-elliptic projector in the jump and average terms. This allows us to simplify the numerical implementation by including the $ H^1 $-elliptic projector in the computable error estimators.
  We derive the reliability and efficiency of the a posteriori error bound by constructing an enriching operator and establishing some related error estimates that align with $C^0$-continuous interior penalty finite element methods.
  As observed in the a priori analysis, the interior penalty virtual elements exhibit similar behaviors to $C^0$-continuous elements despite its discontinuity. This observation extends to the a posteriori estimate since we do not need to account for the jumps of the function itself in the discrete scheme and the error estimators.
  As an outcome of the error estimator, an adaptive VEM is introduced by means of the mesh refinement strategy with the one-hanging-node rule. Numerical results from several benchmark tests confirm the robustness of the proposed error estimators and show the efficiency of the resulting adaptive VEM.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Steady-State Approach for Efficient Multiscale Simulation and Optimization of mAb Glycosylation in CHO Cell Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, influenced by both process conditions and cellular mechanisms. Multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve when using traditional methods, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor (NSD) flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors. This work establishes a solid foundation for multiscale model-based optimization and control of the glycosylation process, supporting the implementation of quality by design.</description>

      <title>Multiscale scattered data analysis in samplet coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiscale scattered data interpolation schemes for globally supported radial basis functions with focus on the Mat\'ern class. The multiscale approximation is constructed through a sequence of residual corrections, where radial basis functions with different lengthscale parameters are combined to capture varying levels of detail. We prove that the condition numbers of the the diagonal blocks of the corresponding multiscale system remain bounded independently of the particular level, allowing us to use an iterative solver with a bounded number of iterations for the numerical solution. Employing an appropriate diagonal scaling, the multiscale system becomes well conditioned. We exploit this fact to derive a general error estimate bounding the consistency error issuing from a numerical approximation of the multiscale system. To apply the multiscale approach to large data sets, we suggest to represent each level of the multiscale system in samplet coordinates. Samplets are localized, discrete signed measures exhibiting vanishing moments and allow for the sparse approximation of generalized Vandermonde matrices issuing from a vast class of radial basis functions. Given a quasi-uniform set of $N$ data sites, and local approximation spaces with exponentially decreasing dimension, the samplet compressed multiscale system can be assembled with cost $\mathcal{O}(N \log^2 N)$. The overall cost of the proposed approach is $\mathcal{O}(N \log^2 N)$. The theoretical findings are accompanied by extensive numerical studies in two and three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A preconditioning technique of Gauss--Legendre quadrature for the logarithm of symmetric positive definite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note considers the computation of the logarithm of symmetric positive definite matrices using the Gauss--Legendre (GL) quadrature. The GL quadrature becomes slow when the condition number of the given matrix is large. In this note, we propose a technique dividing the matrix logarithm into two matrix logarithms, where the condition numbers of the divided logarithm arguments are smaller than that of the original matrix. Although the matrix logarithm needs to be computed twice, each computation can be performed more efficiently, and it potentially reduces the overall computational cost. It is shown that the proposed technique is effective when the condition number of the given matrix is approximately between $130$ and $3.0\times 10^5$.</description>

      <title>Active flux methods for hyperbolic conservation laws -- flux vector splitting and bound-preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models important in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in that only a fixed symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right-hand sides) is solved at each time step. The solutions remain uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme accurately captures the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors and invariant measures of the scheme converging to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero.
  In our numerical experiments, we adopt an indirect approach, using statistics from long-time simulations to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first-order under the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order under the L^1 metric. This implies that extremely long simulations are required to achieve high-precision approximations of the invariant measure (or climate). Nevertheless, the second-order scheme significantly outperforms its first-order counterpart, requiring far less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Lift-and-Embed Learning Methods for Solving Scalar Hyperbolic Equations with Discontinuous Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning methods, which exploit auto-differentiation to compute derivatives without dispersion or dissipation errors, have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to classical mesh-based numerical schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. However, solutions to hyperbolic problems are often piecewise smooth, posing challenges for training of neural networks to capture solution discontinuities and jumps across interfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel lift-and-embed learning method to effectively resolve these challenges. The proposed method comprises three innovative components: (i) embedding the Rankine-Hugoniot condition within a one-order higher-dimensional space by including an augmented variable; (ii) utilizing neural networks to handle the increased dimensionality and address both linear and nonlinear problems within a unified mesh-free learning framework; and (iii) projecting the trained model back onto the original physical domain to obtain the approximate solution. Notably, the location of discontinuities also can be treated as trainable parameters in our method and inferred concurrently with the training of neural network solutions. With collocation points sampled only on piecewise surfaces rather than fulfilling the whole lifted space, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our method can efficiently and accurately solve scalar hyperbolic equations with discontinuous solutions without spurious smearing or oscillations.</description>

      <title>Explicit symmetric low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical approximation of low-regularity solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is notoriously difficult and even more so if structure-preserving schemes are sought. Recent works have been successful in establishing symmetric low-regularity integrators for this equation. However, so far, all prior symmetric low-regularity algorithms are fully implicit, and therefore require the solution of a nonlinear equation at each time step, leading to significant numerical cost in the iteration. In this work, we introduce the first fully explicit (multi-step) symmetric low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the construction of an entire class of such schemes which notably can be used to symmetrise (in explicit form) a large amount of existing low-regularity integrators. We provide rigorous convergence analysis of our schemes and numerical examples demonstrating both the favourable structure preservation properties obtained with our novel schemes, and the significant reduction in computational cost over implicit methods.</description>

      <title>Multilevel randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested integration problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications, including Bayesian experimental design, financial risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. These nested integrals take the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, for nonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering complexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel estimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to handle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner number of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand evaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant reductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed estimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is evaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without compromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical experiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of experiments. When applied to Gaussian noise in the experiment, a truncation scheme ensures finite error bounds at the same computational complexity as in the bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results reveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and rQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and offering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested integration problems across various domains.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical approach for multicontinuum homogenization in high contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization method, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling complex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on distinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems to capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these cell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally expensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for non-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical multicontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define hierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of varying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a combination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels and an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the original constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite element (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint. By normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(L \eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings across hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\eta$, and spatial dimension $d$. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in media with slowly varying properties, underscoring its potential for efficient multiscale modeling.</description>

      <title>P-Order: A Unified Convergence-Analysis Framework for Multivariate Iterative Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose P-order (Power-order), a unified, norm-independent framework for quantifying the convergence rates of iterative methods. Standard analyses based on Q-order are norm-dependent and require some uniformity of error reductions asymptotically. Although the Ortega--Rheinboldt R-order supports non-uniform (including non-monotonic sequences) and is norm-independent, it does not differentiate among various sublinear rates and has ambiguities for some superlinear rates. In contrast, our proposed framework parameterizes the convergence rate in direct analogy with asymptotic notation in combinatorial algorithm analysis (including little-$o$, big-$\Theta$, and little-$\omega$), thereby precisely distinguishing linear, sublinear (e.g., fractional-power), and superlinear (e.g., linearithmic) regimes. We also introduce two subclasses of P-order: Quasi-Uniform P-order (QUP) and Uniform P-order (UP), and show their relations with Q-order and R-order. We demonstrate the ease-of-use and flexibility of QUP-order by analyzing fixed-point iterations and show that P-order can provide tighter bounds on the convergence rate than R-order for both sublinearly and superlinearly convergent cases while avoiding some ambiguities in R-order. Furthermore, we present a refined analysis of Newton's method for nonlinear equations with a wide spectrum of sublinear and superlinear convergence rates (including a newly defined anit-liearithmic rate).</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Stochastic Inverse Problems via Variational Bayesian Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian inversion method demonstrates significant potential for solving inverse problems, enabling both point estimation and uncertainty quantification. However, Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation may become unstable when handling data from diverse distributions (e.g., solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)). Additionally, Monte Carlo sampling methods are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions. In the first stage, we introduce a new weighting formulation to ensure the stability of the Bayesian MAP estimation. In the second stage, we derive the necessary condition to efficiently quantify the uncertainty of the solutions, by combining the new weighting formula with variational inference. Furthermore, we establish an error estimation theorem that relates the exact solution to the optimally estimated solution under different amounts of observed data. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the stochastic particle method, this paper establishes an easily implementable explicit numerical method for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) with super-linear growth coefficients. The paper establishes the theory on the propagation of chaos in the $L^{q}$ sense. The optimal strong convergence rate $1/2$-order of the numerical solutions is obtained for the interacting particle system by the stopping time techniques. Furthermore, it is proved that the numerical solutions capture the long-term dynamical behaviors of MV-SDEs precisely, including moment boundedness, stability, and ergodicity. Moreover, a unique numerical invariant probability measure is yielded, which converges to the underlying invariant probability measure of MV-SDEs in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance. Finally, several numerical experiments are carried out to support the main results.</description>

Abstract: We consider weakly interacting diffusions on the torus, for multichromatic interaction potentials. We consider interaction potentials that are not H-stable, leading to phase transitions in the mean field limit. We show that the mean field dynamics can exhibit multipeak stationary states, where the number of peaks is related to the number of nonzero Fourier modes of the interaction. We also consider the effect of a confining potential on the structure of non-uniform steady states. We approach the problem by means of analysis, perturbation theory and numerical simulations for the interacting particle systems and the PDEs.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Wasserstein distances allow to quantitatively compare two continuous or atomic mass distributions with equal or different total mass. In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical performance of composite materials. During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can influence fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest. Numerical experiments employ the Cross-WLF viscosity model and Hagen-Poiseuille flow to investigate the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model, incorporating analytical solutions, are used for verification. Results show that the method improves significantly upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation</title>

Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric spectral density estimation from irregularly sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric spectral density estimator for continuous-time and continuous-space processes measured at fully irregular locations. Our estimator is constructed using a weighted nonuniform Fourier sum whose weights yield a high-accuracy quadrature rule with respect to a user-specified window function. The resulting estimator significantly reduces the aliasing seen in periodogram approaches and least squares spectral analysis, sidesteps the dangers of ill-conditioning of the nonuniform Fourier inverse problem, and can be adapted to a wide variety of irregular sampling settings. After a discussion of methods for computing the necessary weights and a theoretical analysis of sources of bias, we close with demonstrations of the method's efficacy, including for processes that exhibit very slow spectral decay and for processes in multiple dimensions.</description>
