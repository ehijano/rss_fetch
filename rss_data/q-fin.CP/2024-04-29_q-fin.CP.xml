      <title>Application of Deep Learning for Factor Timing in Asset Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper examines the performance of regression models (OLS linear regression, Ridge regression, Random Forest, and Fully-connected Neural Network) on the prediction of CMA (Conservative Minus Aggressive) factor premium and the performance of factor timing investment with them. Out-of-sample R-squared shows that more flexible models have better performance in explaining the variance in factor premium of the unseen period, and the back testing affirms that the factor timing based on more flexible models tends to over perform the ones with linear models. However, for flexible models like neural networks, the optimal weights based on their prediction tend to be unstable, which can lead to high transaction costs and market impacts. We verify that tilting down the rebalance frequency according to the historical optimal rebalancing scheme can help reduce the transaction costs.</description>

      <title>A pure dual approach for hedging Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dual approach to compute the hedging portfolio of a Bermudan option and its initial value. It gives a "purely dual" algorithm following the spirit of Rogers (2010) in the sense that it only relies on the dual pricing formula. The key is to rewrite the dual formula as an excess reward representation and to combine it with a strict convexification technique. The hedging strategy is then obtained by using a Monte Carlo method, solving backward a sequence of least square problems. We show convergence results for our algorithm and test it on many different Bermudan options. Beyond giving directly the hedging portfolio, the strength of the algorithm is to assess both the relevance of including financial instruments in the hedging portfolio and the effect of the rebalancing frequency.</description>

      <title>Data Scaling Effect of Deep Learning in Financial Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many years, researchers have been exploring the use of deep learning in the forecasting of financial time series. However, they have continued to rely on the conventional econometric approach for model optimization, optimizing the deep learning models on individual assets. In this paper, we use the stock volatility forecast as an example to illustrate global training - optimizes the deep learning model across a wide range of stocks - is both necessary and beneficial for any academic or industry practitioners who is interested in employing deep learning to forecast financial time series. Furthermore, a pre-trained foundation model for volatility forecast is introduced, capable of making accurate zero-shot forecasts for any stocks.</description>
