      <title>Exact solution of the relationship between the eigenvalue discreteness and the behavior of eigenstates in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate localization and bulk-boundary correspondence are fundamental phenomena in one-dimensional (1D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The eigenvalues discreteness and the eigenstates localization exhibit a high degree of consistency as system information evolve. We explore the relationship between the eigenvalue discreteness and the eigenstates behavior in 1D SSH lattices. The discreteness fraction and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) combined with a Taylor expansion are utilized to describe the relationship. In the Hermitian case, we employ the bulk-edge correspondence and the perturbation theory to derive an exact solution considering both zero and non-zero modes. We also extend our analysis to the non-Hermitian cases, assuming that eigenvalues remain purely real. Our findings reveal a logarithmic relationship between the degree of eigenvalue discreteness and eigenstates localization, which holds under both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian conditions. This result is fully consistent with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Optimal Diffusion for Infection Control in Brownian Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spread of infectious diseases requires integrating movement and interaction dynamics into epidemiological models. In this study, we investigate the role of particle diffusivity and physical constraints in shaping infection dynamics within a system of Brownian particles. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, we uncover a nontrivial relationship between diffusivity and infection speed: an optimal diffusion coefficient exists that minimizes the infection spreading speed. This counterintuitive result arises from a balance between particle mixing and interaction frequency. The optimal diffusivity is observed in both interacting and non-interacting systems when the infection radius exceeds the mean lattice spacing and the initial configuration is out of equilibrium. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the spread of infections in confined and diffusive environments, with potential implications for designing movement-based strategies for infection control.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast X-ray induced damage and nonthermal melting in cadmium sulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide is a valuable material for solar cells, photovoltaic, and radiation detectors. It is thus important to evaluate the material damage mechanisms and damage threshold in response to irradiation. Here, we simulate the ultrafast XUV/X-ray irradiation of CdS with the combined model, XTANT-3. It accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling between the two systems, nonthermal melting and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. We find that the two phases of CdS, zinc blende and wurtzite, demonstrate very close damage threshold dose of ~0.4-0.5 eV/atom. The damage is mainly thermal, whereas with increase of the dose, nonthermal effects begin to dominate leading to nonthermal melting. The transient disordered state is a high-density liquid, which may be semiconducting or metallic depending on the dose. Later recrystallization may recover the material back to the crystalline phase, or at high doses create an amorphous phase with variable bandgap. The revealed effects may potentially allow for controllable tuning of the band gap via laser irradiation of CdS.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between a dielectric nanocavity and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction of a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement of light and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). Avoided crossing is demonstrated with both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g \approx 5$ meV. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with numerically-obtained values with the exciton-reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $4.6$ meV. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with the low losses and the sub-wavelength light confinement, could pave the way towards single-photon nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Evidence for Density Wave Order in Two Dimensional 4He Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We previously reported the discovery of a two dimensional $^{4}$He supersolid; a state with intertwined density wave and superfluid order, observed in the second layer of $^{4}$He adsorbed on graphite. In this Letter we provide direct evidence for the density wave order, obtained by doping the layer with a small concentration of $^{3}$He atoms (impuritons). The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.</description>
