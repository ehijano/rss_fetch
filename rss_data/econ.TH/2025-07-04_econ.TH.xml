      <title>The algebraic structures of social organizations: the operad of cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to settle a conceptual framework for cooperative game theory in which the notion of composition/aggregation of games is the defining structure. This is done via the mathematical theory of algebraic operads: we start by endowing the collection of all cooperative games with any number of players with an operad structure, and we show that it generalises all the previous notions of sums, products and compositions of games considered by Owen, Shapley, von Neumann and Morgenstern, and many others. Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators and relations, showing that the M\"obius transform map induces a canonical isomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes commutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any cooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the 2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many interesting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures and convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and thus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity theorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra. Finally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave under composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of the core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value and the Banzhaf index of a compound game.</description>

      <title>A unified model of horizontal differentiation with general spaces and irrational consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new microeconomic model of horizontal differentiation that unifies and extends previous developments inspired by the seminal work of Hotelling (1929). Our framework incorporates boundedly rational consumers, an unlimited number of firms, and arbitrary differentiation spaces with Riemannian manifolds. We argue that Riemannian geometry provides a natural and powerful tool for analyzing such models, offering fresh insights into firm behavior and market structure with complex products.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate Bidders in Non-Truthful Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of bidders.</description>

      <title>Allocating Positional Goods: A Mechanism Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal allocation of positional goods in the presence of externalities arising from consumers' concerns for relative consumption. Using a mechanism design approach, I characterize the externalities by a feasibility condition. I show that the revenue-maximizing mechanism possibly excludes some buyers and fully separates the participants if their type distribution satisfies Myerson's regularity. The seller can guarantee at least half the maximum revenue by offering a single level of positional goods. When there is no exclusion, as the seller offers more positional good levels, the consumer surplus decreases (increases) if the distribution has an increasing (decreasing) failure rate. Higher participation increases the consumer surplus under increasing failure rates. Applications include luxury goods, priority services, education, and organizational hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Bounded Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive decision-making relies on strategic reasoning. Two prominent frameworks are (1) models of bounded reasoning, exemplified by level-$k$ models, which keep reasoning implicit, and (2) epistemic game theory, which makes reasoning explicit. We connect these approaches by "lifting" static complete-information games into incomplete-information settings where payoff types reflect players' reasoning depths as in level-$k$ models. We introduce downward rationalizability, defined via minimal belief restrictions capturing the basic idea common to level-$k$ models, to provide robust yet well-founded predictions in games where bounded reasoning matters. We then refine these belief restrictions to analyze the foundations of two seminal models of bounded reasoning: the classic level-$k$ model and the cognitive hierarchy model. Our findings shed light on the distinction between hard cognitive bounds on reasoning and beliefs about co-players' types. Furthermore, they offer insights into robustness issues relevant for market design. Thus, our approach unifies key level-$k$ models building on clear foundations of strategic reasoning stemming from epistemic game theory.</description>
