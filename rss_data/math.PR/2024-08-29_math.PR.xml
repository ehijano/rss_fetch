      <title>A collision-oriented interacting particle system for Landau-type equations and the molecular chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a collision-oriented particle system to approximate a class of Landau-type equations. This particle system is formally derived from a particle system with random collisions in the grazing regime, and happens to be a special random batch system with random interaction in the diffusion coefficient. The difference from usual random batch systems with random interaction in the drift is that the batch size has to be $p=2$. We then analyze the convergence rate of the proposed particle system to the Landau-type equations using the tool of relative entropy, assuming that the interaction kernels are regular enough. A key aspect of our approach is the gradient estimates of logarithmic densities, applied to both the Landau-type equations and the particle systems. Compared to existing particle systems for the approximation of Landau-type equations, our proposed system not only offers a more intrinsic reflection of the underlying physics but also reduces the computational cost to $O(N)$ per time step when implemented numerically.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of L\'evy tax processes with bailouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider controlling the paths of a spectrally negative L\'evy process by two means: the subtraction of `taxes' when the process is at an all-time maximum, and the addition of `bailouts' which keep the value of the process above zero. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of maximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received and cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has been considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and characterise a large class of controlled L\'evy processes to which the optimal solution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions to the case of a general L\'evy process with no positive jumps.</description>

      <title>Constructive approaches to concentration inequalities with independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities, a major tool in probability theory, quantify how much a random variable deviates from a certain quantity. This paper proposes a systematic convex optimization approach to studying and generating concentration inequalities with independent random variables. Specifically, we extend the generalized problem of moments to independent random variables.
  We first introduce a variational approach that extends classical moment-generating functions, focusing particularly on first-order moment conditions. Second, we develop a polynomial approach, based on a hierarchy of sum-of-square approximations, to extend these techniques to higher-moment conditions. Building on these advancements, we refine Hoeffding's, Bennett's and Bernstein's inequalities, providing improved worst-case guarantees compared to existing results.</description>

      <title>ASEP via Mallows coloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (=ASEP) with finitely many particles. It turns out that a certain randomized initial condition is the most amenable to such an analysis. Our main result is the behavior of such an ASEP in the KPZ limit regime. A key technical tool introduced in the paper -- the coloring of ASEP particles with the use of random Mallows permutations -- may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotics for finite point-to-plane connections in supercritical bond percolation in dimension at least three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider supercritical bond percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 3$. The origin lies in a finite open cluster with positive probability, and, when it does, the diameter of this cluster has an exponentially decaying tail. For each unit vector $\bf\ell$, we prove sharp asymptotics for the probability that this cluster contains a vertex $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfies $x \cdot \bf\ell \geq u$. For an axially aligned $\bf\ell$, we find this probability to be of the form $\kappa \exp \{ - \zeta u \}(1+ {\rm err})$ for $u \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\vert {\rm err} \vert$ is at most $C \exp \{ - c u^{1/2} \big\}$; for general $\bf\ell$, the form of the asymptotic depends on whether $\bf\ell$ satisfies a natural lattice condition. To obtain these results, we prove that renewal points in long clusters are abundant, with a renewal block length whose tail is shown to decay as fast as $C \exp \big\{ - c u^{1/2} \big\}$.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlations for the massless hierarchical Liouville model in infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A_v)_{v\in \mathcal{T}}$ be the balanced Gaussian Branching Random Walk on a $d$-ary tree $\mathcal{T}$ and let $M^A$ be the multiplicative chaos with parameter $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2\log d})$ constructed from $A$. In this work we establish the precise first order asymptotics of negative exponential moment of $M^A$, i.e.\ we prove that for $t_k = \lambda p_\gamma^k$ with $\lambda&gt;0$ and $p_\gamma$ an explicit constant depending only on $\gamma$, we have as $k \to \infty$, \begin{equation} -\frac{1}{d^k} \log \mathbb{E}[e^{-\lambda p_\gamma^k M^A } ] \to h(\lambda), \end{equation} where $h\colon (0,\infty)\to \mathbb{R}$ is a non-explicit positive continuous function.
  This result allows us to study the law of $A$ tilted by $e^{-t_k M^A}$ for particular values of $\lambda$, with $k\to \infty$. In this setting we prove that the normalized $L^1$ norm of $A$ in generation $k-a$ is bounded and converges to $0$ when first $k\to \infty$ and then $a\to 0$.
  As an application we prove that in this setting, under the tilt $e^{-t_k M^A}$ and with $k\to \infty$, the Branching Random Walk $A$ exhibits a weak decay of correlation, which is not present in the non-tilted model.
  Our methods also apply to the usual Branching Random Walk $(S_v)_{v\in \mathcal{T}}$ and with $M^A$ replaced by $\frac{1}{2}(M^+ + M^- )$, where $M^+$ and $M^-$ are the multiplicative chaoses with parameter $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2\log d})$ constructed from $S$ and $-S$. In that case we prove that, as $k\to \infty$, \begin{equation} -\frac{1}{d^k} \log \mathbb{E}[e^{- \frac{\lambda p_\gamma^k}{2}( M^+ + M^-) }] \to \tilde h(\lambda), \end{equation} where $\tilde h\colon (0,\infty)\to \mathbb{R}$ is again a non-explicit positive continuous function.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript provides an in-depth exploration of Brownian Motion, a fundamental stochastic process in probability theory for Biostatisticians. It begins with foundational definitions and properties, including the construction of Brownian motion and its Markovian characteristics. The document delves into advanced topics such as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, reflection principles, and Levy's modulus of continuity. Through rigorous proofs and theorems, the manuscript examines the non-differentiability of Brownian paths, the behavior of zero sets, and the significance of local time. The notes also cover important results like Donsker's theorem and Blumenthal's 0-1 law, emphasizing their implications in the study of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diagnostics (Part II): Prevalence, Linear Independence, and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second manuscript in a two-part series that uses diagnostic testing to understand the connection between prevalence (i.e. number of elements in a class), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and classification theory. Part I considered the context of supervised machine learning (ML) and established a duality between prevalence and the concept of relative conditional probability. The key idea of that analysis was to train a family of discriminative classifiers by minimizing a sum of prevalence-weighted empirical risk functions. The resulting outputs can be interpreted as relative probability level-sets, which thereby yield uncertainty estimates in the class labels. This procedure also demonstrated that certain discriminative and generative ML models are equivalent. Part II considers the extent to which these results can be extended to tasks in unsupervised learning through recourse to ideas in linear algebra. We first observe that the distribution of an impure population, for which the class of a corresponding sample is unknown, can be parameterized in terms of a prevalence. This motivates us to introduce the concept of linearly independent populations, which have different but unknown prevalence values. Using this, we identify an isomorphism between classifiers defined in terms of impure and pure populations. In certain cases, this also leads to a nonlinear system of equations whose solution yields the prevalence values of the linearly independent populations, fully realizing unsupervised learning as a generalization of supervised learning. We illustrate our methods in the context of synthetic data and a research-use-only SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>

      <title>Small deviations of Gaussian multiplicative chaos and the free energy of the two-dimensional massless Sinh--Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new small deviations bounds for a class of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures obtained from Gaussian fields with zero spatial average. The upper bound holds for a class of fields closely related to the $\star$-scale invariant Gaussian fields in arbitrary number of dimensions, and the lower bound holds for the Gaussian free field with zero spatial average on the torus. The upper bound is obtained by a modification of the method that was used in \cite{LRV}, and the lower bound is obtained by applying the Donsker--Varadhan variational formula.
  We also give the probabilistic path integral formulation of the massless Sinh--Gordon model on a torus of side length $R$, and study its partition function $R$ tends to infinity. We apply the small deviation bounds for Gaussian multiplicative chaos to obtain lower and upper bounds for the logarithm of the partition function, leading to the existence of a non-zero and finite subsequential infinite volume limit for the free energy.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gaussian mixture solution for linear Bayesian inversion with application to Laplace priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on Bayesian inverse problems with Gaussian likelihood, linear forward model, and priors that can be formulated as a Gaussian mixture. Such a mixture is expressed as an integral of Gaussian density functions weighted by a mixing density over the mixing variables. Within this framework, the corresponding posterior distribution also takes the form of a Gaussian mixture, and we derive the closed-form expression for its posterior mixing density. To sample from the posterior Gaussian mixture, we propose a two-step sampling method. First, we sample the mixture variables from the posterior mixing density, and then we sample the variables of interest from Gaussian densities conditioned on the sampled mixing variables. However, the posterior mixing density is relatively difficult to sample from, especially in high dimensions. Therefore, we propose to replace the posterior mixing density by a dimension-reduced approximation, and we provide a bound in the Hellinger distance for the resulting approximate posterior. We apply the proposed approach to a posterior with Laplace prior, where we introduce two dimension-reduced approximations for the posterior mixing density. Our numerical experiments indicate that samples generated via the proposed approximations have very low correlation and are close to the exact posterior.</description>

Abstract: For the heterochaos baker maps whose central direction is mostly neutral, we prove that correlations for H\"older continuous functions decay at an optimal polynomial rate of order $n^{-3/2}$. Our method of proof relies on a description of the action of a reduced Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a comparison to the symmetric simple random walk with an absorbing wall, aka `gambler's ruin problem'.</description>

      <title>A Score-Based Density Formula, with Applications in Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling, achieving unprecedented success in generating realistic and diverse content. Despite empirical advances, the theoretical basis for why optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood is effective for training diffusion generative models, such as DDPMs, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this question by establishing a density formula for a continuous-time diffusion process, which can be viewed as the continuous-time limit of the forward process in an SGM. This formula reveals the connection between the target density and the score function associated with each step of the forward process. Building on this, we demonstrate that the minimizer of the optimization objective for training DDPMs nearly coincides with that of the true objective, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing DDPMs using the ELBO. Furthermore, we offer new insights into the role of score-matching regularization in training GANs, the use of ELBO in diffusion classifiers, and the recently proposed diffusion loss.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz continuity in the Hurst parameter of functionals of stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.03475v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitivity analysis w.r.t. the long-range/memory noise parameter for probability distributions of functionals of solutions to stochastic differential equations is an important stochastic modeling issue in many applications.
  In this paper we consider solutions $\{X^H_t\}_{t\in \mathbb{R}_+}$ to stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions. We develop two innovative sensitivity analyses when the Hurst parameter $H$ of the noise tends to the critical Brownian parameter $H=\tfrac{1}{2}$ from above or from below. First, we examine expected smooth functions of $X^H$ at a fixed time horizon $T$. Second, we examine Laplace transforms of functionals which are irregular with regard to Malliavin calculus, namely, first passage times of $X^H$ at a given threshold.
  In both cases we exhibit the Lipschitz continuity w.r.t. $H$ around the value $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Therefore, our results show that the Markov Brownian model is a good proxy model as long as the Hurst parameter remains close to $\tfrac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.10176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radical shifts in the genetic composition of large cell populations are rare events with quite low probabilities, which direct numerical simulations generally fail to evaluate accurately. In this paper, we develop a theoretical large deviations framework for a class of Markov chains modeling the genetic evolution of bacteria such as E. coli. In particular, we develop the cost function for discrete-time Markov chains which describe the daily evolution of histograms of bacterial populations. We also develop explicit formulas that can be used to numerically quantify the most likely evolutionary trajectories connecting an initial histogram and the target histogram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces whose law has been reweighted according to nesting statistics for a conformal loop ensemble (CLE) relative to $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$ marked points $z_1,\dots,z_n$. The idea is to consider a reweighting by $\prod_{B\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}} e^{\sigma_B N_B}$, where $\sigma_B\in\mathbb{R}$ and $N_B$ is the number of CLE loops surrounding the points $z_i$ for $i\in B$. This is made precise via an approximation procedure where as part of the proof we derive strong spatial independence results for CLE. The reweighting induces logarithmic singularities for the Liouville field at $z_1,\dots,z_n$ with a magnitude depending explicitly on $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$. We define the partition function of the surface, compute it for $n\in\{0,1\}$, and derive a recursive formula expressing the $n&gt;1$ point partition function in terms of lower-order partition functions. The proof of the latter result is based on a continuum peeling process previously studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner in the case $n=0$, and we derive an explicit formula for the generator of a boundary length process that can be associated with the exploration for general $n$. We use the recursive formula to partly characterize for which values of $(\sigma_B\colon B\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\})$ the partition function is finite. Finally, we give a new proof for the law of the conformal radius of CLE, which was originally established by Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a joint introduction to classical and free probability, which are twin sisters. We first review the foundations of classical probability, notably with the main limiting theorems (CLT, CCLT, PLT, CPLT), and with a look into examples coming from Lie groups and random matrices. Then we present the foundations and main results of free probability, notably with free limiting theorems, and with a look into examples coming from quantum groups and random matrices. We discuss then a number of more advanced aspects, in relation with free geometry and with subfactor theory.</description>

      <title>The critical window in activated random walk on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an elementary model for self-organised criticality, the activated random walk on the complete graph. We introduce a discrete time Markov chain as follows. At each time step we add an active particle at a random vertex and let the system stabilise following the activated random walk dynamics, obtaining a particle configuration with all sleeping particles. Particles visiting a boundary vertex are removed from the system. We characterise the support of the stationary distribution of this Markov chain, showing that, with high probability, the number of particles concentrates around the value $\rho_c N + a \sqrt{N \log N}$ within a critical window of size at most $o( \sqrt{N \log N })$, where $N$ is the number of vertices. Due to the mean-field nature of the model, we are able to determine precisely the critical density $\rho_c= \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the sleeping rate, as well as the constant $a = \frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{1+\lambda}$ characterising the lower order shift. Our approach utilises results about super-martingales associated with activated random walk that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometric Ergodicity and Wasserstein Continuity of Non-Linear Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present conditions for the geometric ergodicity and Wasserstein regularity of non-linear filter processes. While previous studies have mainly focused on unique ergodicity and the weak Feller property, our work extends these findings in three directions: (i) We present conditions on the geometric ergodicity of non-linear filters, (ii) we obtain further conditions on unique ergodicity for the case where the state space is compact which complements prior work involving countable spaces, and (iii) as a by-product of our analysis, we obtain Wasserstein continuity of non-linear filters with stronger regularity.</description>

      <title>$G$ Method in Action: Pivot$^{\text{+}}$ Algorithm for Self-avoiding Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pivot algorithm -- we also call it the pivot chain -- is an algorithm for approximately uniform sampling from $\Omega _{N},$ the set of $N$-step self-avoiding walks on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ ($N,$ $d\geq 1$). Based on this algorithm and the $G$ method, we construct another algorithm/chain, called the pivot$^{\text{+}}$ algorithm/chain, for approximately uniform sampling from $\Omega _{N},$ here, $N\geq 2$. The pivot$^{\text{+}}$ algorithm samples the pivot from the set $\left\{ 1,2,...,N-1\right\} $ according to the uniform probability distribution on this set while the pivot algorithm samples the pivot from the set $\left\{0,1,2,...,N-1\right\} $ according to the uniform probability distribution on this set, so, on the pivot, the pivot$^{\text{+}}$ algorithm is better than the pivot algorithm. Further, we obtain another important thing, namely, the pivot$^{\text{+}}$ algorithm/chain enters, at time $1$, a set $2d$ times smaller than $\Omega _{N},$ and stays forever in this set, so, at times $1,2,...$ we work with a chain having a state space $2d$ times smaller than $\Omega _{N}$. As to the speed of convergence, we conjecture that the pivot$^{\text{+}}$ algorithm/chain is faster than the pivot algorithm/chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^\eta$($\eta\in(0,1]$)-Wasserstein distance for mean field interacting particle system is derived, where the diffusion coefficient is allowed to be interacting and the initial distribution of interacting particle system converges to that of the limit equation in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. The non-degenerate and second order system are investigated respectively and the main tool relies on the gradient estimate of the decoupled SDEs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics with estimated nuisance parameters under the null and local alternative hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-sample behavior of non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics of arbitrary degree is investigated under the assumption that their kernel depends on parameters that can be estimated consistently. Mild regularity conditions are given which guarantee that once properly normalized, such statistics are asymptotically multivariate Gaussian both under the null hypothesis and sequences of local alternatives. The work of Randles (1982, \emph{Ann. Statist.}) is extended in three ways: the data and the kernel values can be multivariate rather than univariate, the limiting behavior under local alternatives is studied for the first time, and the effect of knowing some of the nuisance parameters is quantified. These results can be applied to a broad range of goodness-of-fit testing contexts, as shown in two specific examples.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree ($k$), even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>On the positivity of some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired in the papers by Angelo and Xu, Q.J Math., 74, pp. 767-777, and improvements by Kerr and Klurman, arXiv:2211.05540, we study the probability that the weighted sums of a Rademacher random multiplicative function, $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)n^{-\sigma}$, are positive for all $x\geq x_\sigma\geq 1$ in the regime $\sigma\to1/2^+$. In a previous paper by the author, when $\sigma\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound for this probability depending on $x_\sigma$ that becomes large as $\sigma\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based in relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a Hal\'asz-Bonami's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the partial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
