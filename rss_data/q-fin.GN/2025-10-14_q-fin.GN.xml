      <title>Chronologically Consistent Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction tasks that is free of lookahead bias.</description>

      <title>Stablecoins and the Emerging Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD250 billion by mid-2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming a hybrid monetary ecosystem where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through a number of econometric analysis models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type exhibiting distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization depending on the mechanisms behind. We also introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure, which private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model takes advantages of both decentralized finance and payment innovation, while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the SVB-USDC de-peg event in 2023 illustrates how such a hybrid system could have prevented panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Through examination of the Dybvig model and simulation, we conclude that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems, but it also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures.</description>

      <title>Inverse Portfolio Optimization with Synthetic Investor Data: Recovering Risk Preferences under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops an inverse portfolio optimization framework for recovering latent investor preferences including risk aversion, transaction cost sensitivity, and ESG orientation from observed portfolio allocations. Using controlled synthetic data, we assess the estimator's statistical properties such as consistency, coverage, and dynamic regret. The model integrates robust optimization and regret-based inference to quantify welfare losses under preference misspecification and market shocks. Simulation experiments demonstrate accurate recovery of transaction cost parameters, partial identifiability of ESG penalties, and sublinear regret even under stochastic volatility and liquidity shocks. A real-data illustration using ETFs confirms that transaction-cost shocks dominate volatility shocks in welfare impact. The framework thus provides a statistically rigorous and economically interpretable tool for robust preference inference and portfolio design under uncertainty.</description>
