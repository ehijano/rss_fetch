      <title>Real Global Group Laws and Hu-Kriz Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Hausmann defined global group laws and used them to prove that $MU^G_*$ is the $G$-equivariant Lazard ring, for $G$ a compact abelian Lie group. On the other hand, Hu and Kriz showed that the restriction map induces an isomorphism $M \mathbb{R}^{C_2}_{\rho *} \cong MU_{2*}$. In this paper, we blend these stories. We utilize the $C_2$-global spectrum $\mathbf{MR}$ defined by Schwede in an unpublished note, which gives rise to a genuine $G$-spectrum $M \mathbb{R}_\eta$ for each augmented compact Lie groups $\eta: G\to C_2$, simultaneously generalizing $MU_G$ and $M \mathbb{R}$. In the case of semi-direct product augmentations $G \rtimes C_2\to C_2$ with $G$ compact abelian Lie and $C_2$ acting by inversion, we show that the restriction along the inclusion $G \subset G \rtimes C_2$ is a split surjection $M \mathbb{R}^{G \rtimes C_2}_{\rho *} \rightarrow MU^{G}_{2*}$. Additionally, we propose an evenness conjecture, which implies that this map is an isomorphism. Along the way, we define Real $\eta$-orientations, Real global orientations, and corresponding notions of equivariant and global group laws.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is a contribution written for the second volume of the Encyclopedia of mathematical physics. We give an informal introduction to the notions of an $(\infty,n)$-category and $(\infty,n)$-functor, discussing some of the different models that implement them. We also discuss the notions of a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category and symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-functor, recalling some important results whose statements employ the language of $(\infty,n)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Poset functor cocalculus and applications to topological data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new flavor of functor cocalculus, named poset cocalculus, as a tool for studying approximations in topological data analysis. Given a functor from a distributive lattice to a model category, poset cocalculus produces a Taylor telescope of degree $n$ approximations of the functor, where a degree $n$ functor takes strongly bicartesian $(n+1)$-cubes to homotopy cocartesian $(n+1)$-cubes. We give several applications of this new functor cocalculus. We prove that the degree $n$ approximation of a multipersistence module is stable under an appropriate notion of interleaving distance. We show that the Vietoris-Rips filtration is precisely the degree 2 approximation of the \v{C}ech filtration, and we draw connections between poset cocalculus and discrete Morse theory. We demonstrate that the degree 1 approximation of the space of simplicial maps between two simplicial complexes is in some sense the space of continuous maps between their realizations, and that this statement can be made precise.</description>

      <title>Iterated residue, toric forms and Witten genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of {\em iterated residue} to study generalized Bott manifolds. When applying the iterated residues to compute the Borisov-Gunnells toric form and the Witten genus of certain toric varieties as well as complete intersections, we obtain interesting vanishing results and some theta function identities, one of which is a twisted version of a classical Rogers-Ramanujan type formula.</description>

      <title>The homological spectrum via definable subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an alternative approach to the homological spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category through the lens of definable subcategories. This culminates in a proof that the homological spectrum is homeomorphic to a quotient of the Ziegler spectrum. Along the way, we characterise injective objects in homological residue fields in terms of the definable subcategory corresponding to a given homological prime. We use these results to give a purity perspective on the relationship between the homological and Balmer spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quillen (co)homology of divided power algebras over an operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barr--Beck cohomology, put into the framework of model categories by Quillen, provides a cohomology theory for any algebraic structure, for example Andr\'e--Quillen cohomology of commutative rings. Quillen cohomology has been studied notably for divided power algebras and restricted Lie algebras, both of which are instances of divided power algebras over an operad $P$: the commutative and Lie operad respectively. In this paper, we investigate the Quillen cohomology of divided power algebras over an operad $P$, identifying Beck modules, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials in that setup. We also compare the cohomology of divided power algebras over $P$ with that of $P$-algebras, and work out some examples.</description>

      <title>A topological proof of the Hell-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of a theorem of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il [J. Comb. Theory B, 48(1):92-110, 1990] using tools from topological combinatorics based on ideas of Lov\'asz [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 25(3):319-324, 1978]. The Hell-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il Theorem provides a dichotomy of the graph homomorphism problem. It states that deciding whether there is a graph homomorphism from a given graph to a fixed graph $H$ is in P if $H$ is bipartite (or contains a self-loop), and is NP-complete otherwise. In our proof we combine topological combinatorics with the algebraic approach to constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <title>Morse Sequences: A simple approach to discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the notion of a Morse sequence, which provides an alternative approach to discrete Morse theory, and which is both simple and effective. A Morse sequence on a finite simplicial complex is a sequence composed solely of two elementary operations, that is, expansions (the inverse of a collapse), and fillings (the inverse of a perforation). In a dual manner, a Morse sequence may be obtained by considering only collapses and perforations. Such a sequence is another way to represent the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we assign a reference map and an extension map. A reference map associates a set of critical simplexes to each simplex of a given complex, and an extension map associates a set of simplexes to each critical simplex. By considering the boundary of each critical simplex, we obtain a chain complex from these maps, which corresponds precisely to the Morse complex. We show that, when restricted to homology, an extension map is the inverse of a reference map. Also we show that these two maps allow us to recover directly the isomorphism theorem between the homology of an object and the homology of its Morse complex. At last, we introduce the notion of a flow complex, which is based solely on extension maps. We prove that this notion is equivalent to the classical one based on gradient flows.</description>
