      <title>Structural Invariance of Green--Griffiths--Demailly Thresholds on Compact Complex Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Green--Griffiths--Demailly (GGD) hyperbolicity thresholds are structurally invariant. In other words, the minimal jet order and asymptotic growth rate at which invariant jet differentials appear remain unchanged when passing from a compact complex manifold to any compact smooth analytic Deligne--Mumford stack (orbifold) with the same coarse K\"ahler class. We establish an orbifold Riemann--Roch formula showing that only the identity sector contributes to the leading $m^n$ term of the Euler characteristic $\chi$, while all twisted sectors contribute only $O(m^{n-1})$. Together with curvature--positivity properties of the Demailly--Semple tower, this implies that the existence range of invariant jet differentials depends solely on the coarse K\"ahler class--hence orbifold compactification or rigidification does not alter the GGD threshold or the hyperbolicity locus.</description>

      <title>On the tensor-triangular geometry of isotropic motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor-triangular geometry of the categories of isotropic Tate motives, isotropic Artin motives and isotropic Artin--Tate motives. In particular, we study the categories $DTM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$, $DAM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $DATM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ where $k$ is a flexible field and we fix $\mathbb{F}_2$-coefficients. In this case, we prove their Balmer spectra are singletons. The proof of this relies on the fact that the categories in question are generated by objects whose morphisms are `nilpotent enough.' Furthermore, we investigate their homological spectra, and verify Balmer's Nerves of Steel conjecture in these cases by showing these spaces are also singletons, and we give an explicit description of the homological primes. We also investigate stratification, and we conclude by studying generation properties of these categories -- the latter results we see also apply to global (i.e. non-isotropic) motives.</description>

      <title>Lifting $I$-functions from the Grassmannians to their cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate two fundamental enumerative functions, namely the $I$-functions in the quantum $K$-ring of $G(r,n)$ and of its cotangent bundle, by defining a $K$-theoretic operator on classes, called balancing. This operator lifts the $I$-function of $G(r,n)$ to that of $T^*G(r,n)$, providing an explicit geometric interpretation. We also define an operator acting on difference operators and show that, for certain $K$-theoretic functions and the corresponding difference operators that annihilate them, including the $I$-functions of projective spaces $\mathbb{P}^n$, the balancing operation on difference operators and on classes is compatible. Moreover, for general $G(r,n)$, we recover the Bethe-Ansatz equations for $T^*G(r,n)$ via a procedure inspired by both balancing and the abelian/non-abelian correspondence.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by circles whose Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs are trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by circles are fundamental geometric and combinatorial objects. Related studies have been done and we cannot explain them precisely, or roughly, well.
  We study such regions whose Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs are trees and investigate the trees obtained by a certain inductive rule from a disk in the plane. The Poincar\'e-Reeb graph of such a region is a graph whose underlying set is the set of all components of level sets of the restriction of the canonical projection to the closure and whose vertices are points corresponding to the components containing {\it singular} points. Related studies were started by the author, motivated by importance and difficulty of explicit construction of a real algebraic map onto a prescribed closed region in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the projective plane over a finite field of characteristic not equal to 2, we compute the probability that a randomly selected pair of distinct conics $(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B})$, with $\mathscr{A}$ smooth or singular and $\mathscr{B}$ smooth, in a fixed pencil of conics will admit a triangle or a tetragon inscribed in $\mathscr{A}$ and circumscribed about $\mathscr{B}$. We do this for all pencils, classified up to projective automorphism, with at least one smooth conic; effectively allowing the case where our conic pairs intersect non-transversally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intersection form $F_X$ on the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ of dimension $n$. Although the structure of $F_X$ is relatively well understood in dimensions two and three, much less is known for $n \geq 4$. We investigate the fundamental properties of $F_X$ in higher dimensions and discuss several applications to birational geometry. Finally, we present a number of open problems concerning the relationship between birational invariants and topological invariants of K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Riemann Hypothesis for Non-Abelian Zeta Functions of Genus 2 Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Weng zeta functions associated with curves of genus 2 over finite fields. Building upon Weng's framework for non-abelian zeta functions, we establish that, as the rank n tends to infinity, the Riemann Hypothesis holds for these zeta functions. Our proof relies on the geometric properties of the moduli space of semi-stable bundles, together with several established results for high rank zeta functions, complemented by detailed asymptotic analysis. This result provides new evidence supporting the general validity of the Riemann Hypothesis for Weng zeta functions and offers insight into the analytic structure of non-abelian zeta functions associated with higher-genus curves.</description>

      <title>Hodge theory for local systems and cohomological support loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we pursue two main objectives. The first is to show that the fundamental results of Green-Lazarsfeld (1987, 1991) on generic vanishing theorems, and works of Budur-Wang (2015, 2020) on cohomology jumping loci, can be established within a unified framework based on suitable versions of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma. Our second-and primary-goal is to develop the technical tools required for this approach, namely an $L^2$-Hodge theory for the cohomology of rank-one local systems on quasi-compact K\"ahler manifolds. Further developments concerning higher-rank local systems, as well as several geometric applications, will be presented in a companion paper and are briefly outlined in the introduction.</description>

      <title>Segre Class of Schemes with Regularly Embedded Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Fulton's Residual Intersection Theorem for the Segre class and express the Segre classes of schemes with regularly embedded components in terms of the Chern classes of the normal bundles to the components and their intersections. More specifically, we provide formulas for the following situations: when the components of the scheme intersect transversely and when the ideal sheaf of the scheme, after the blowup along a component, is the product of the ideal sheaves of the exceptional divisor and the residual scheme.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck's proof of Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann-Roch Theorem is one of the cornerstones of algebraic geometry, connecting algebraic data (sheaf cohomology) with geometric ones (intersection theory). This survey paper provides a self-contained introduction and a complete proof of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch (HRR) Theorem for smooth projective varieties over an algebraically closed field.
  Starting from the classical formulations for curves and surfaces, we introduce the two modern tools necessary for the generalization: the Grothendieck group $K_{0}(X)$ as the natural setting for the Euler characteristic, and the Chow ring $A_{\bullet}(X)$ as the setting for cycles and intersection theory. We then construct the fundamental bridge between these two worlds\textemdash the Chern character ($\mathrm{ch}$) and the Todd class ($\mathrm{td}$) \textemdash culminating in a full proof of the HRR formula:
  \[ \chi(X,\mathcal{E})=\int_{X}\mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{E})\cdot\mathrm{td}(X) \] We conclude by showing how this general formula recovers the classical theorems for curves and surfaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most powerful ideas in the study and classification of algebraic varieties is the notion of a model: that is, to single out an object, in the appropriate isomorphism class, with nice properties. This survey aims to define and study suitable models of rational and, more generally, ruled surfaces in the smooth complex case, and to use them to study such surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the projectivized strata of holomorphic differentials with prescribed zero orders contain no positive-dimensional complete subvarieties. In the case of the minimal strata, this resolves a question of Harris concerning the existence of complete families of subcanonical points. Our proof relies on the geometry of flat cylinders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a universal phantom subcategory on the blow-up of the complex projective plane in 11 general points. This phantom subcategory is the orthogonal complement of a non-full exceptional collection of line bundles of maximal length. It provides a new counterexample to a conjecture of Kuznetsov and to a conjecture of Orlov. The first counterexample was constructed by Krah [Invent. Math. {\bf 235} (2024),1009--1018]. As an application, we construct a new co-connective DG-algebra whose derived category is a phantom.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical version of P\'olya's theorem provides a simple method for certifying that a homogeneous polynomial of degree d is strictly copositive, that is, it takes only positive values on the nonnegative real orthant. However, this method might fail to detect copositivity of polynomials that are missing certain degree d monomials. In this paper, we present extensions and converses to P\'olya's theorem for sparse polynomials, using techniques from positive toric geometry. Furthermore, we explore how this method can be used to study the convergence of Feynman integrals in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We construct the Bruhat-Tits stratification of the reduced basic locus of regular ramified unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces of signature $(n\!-\!1,1)$ at vertex-stabilizer level. To study the Bruhat-Tits strata, we introduce strata models$\!-\!$simpler models that are \'{e}tale-locally isomorphic to each stratum. They admit two complementary characterizations: (i) as strict transforms under the blow-up of the local model at its worst point, and (ii) via a partial moduli description given by explicit linear-algebraic conditions; from these we deduce smoothness, explicit dimension formulas and irreducibility of the Bruhat-Tits strata.</description>

      <title>On square-zero elements in the IIB supersymmetry algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the variety of square-zero elements in the (2,0) super Poincar\'e algebra in ten dimensions, together with its orbit stratification induced by the action of the spin group and R-symmetry. This provides a classification of all possible twisting supercharges of type IIB supergravity in a flat background. Compared to other varieties of square-zero elements in super Poincar\'e algebras, we find that the orbit structure is more involved and exhibits several novel features. Among other things, we show that there are two distinct orbits of holomorphic twisting supercharges and a number of mixed topological-holomorphic twists.</description>

      <title>Conformal bootstrap in Mellin space from GG systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple scheme to express the Mellin transform of $D$-dimensional Euclidean conformal bootstrap equation is presented by relating conformal blocks to a Gauss-Grassmann (GG) system due to Gelfand-Graev, associated to conformal integrals, which, in turn, are generalised hypergeometric functions. Usefulness of the expression for obtaining bounds on the spectrum of fields is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Companion matrices, permutations and lattice ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel connection between reductions of companion matrices associated with a symmetric family of certain binomial ideals in the coordinate ring of affine n-space and permutation matrices. Specifically, for fixed monomial orders, we observe that the reduced companion matrices yield permutation matrices satisfying group-theoretic relations. We explore the implications of these reductions, their connections to lattice ideals, and characterize the groups generated by these transformations.</description>

      <title>Code Equivalence, Point Set Equivalence, and Polynomial Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear code equivalence (LCE) problem is shown to be equivalent to the point set equivalence (PSE) problem, i.e., the problem to check whether two sets of points in a projective space over a finite field differ by a linear change of coordinates. For such a point set $\mathbb{X}$, let $R$ be its homogeneous coordinate ring and $\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$ its canonical ideal. Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$. As this doubling is an Artinian Gorenstein algebra, we can use its Macaulay inverse system to reduce the LCE problem to a Polynomial Isomorphism (PI) problem for homogeneous polynomials. The last step is polynomial time under some mild assumptions about the codes. Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on smooth quartic and quintic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface of degree $d\ge 4$ defined over a number field $K$, and let $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)$ be the number of rational points of $X$ of height at most $B$ that do not lie on lines contained in $X$. Assuming a suitable hypothesis on the size of the rank of abelian varieties, we show that $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_X B^{4/3+\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This improves an unconditional and uniform bound from Salberger for $d=4$ and $d=5$. The proof, based on an argument of Heath-Brown, consists of cutting $X$ by projective planes and using a uniform version of Faltings's Theorem due to Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, to bound the number of rational points on the plane sections of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the work of Bousfield and Kan on monadic resolutions of spaces to $\infty$-topoi, with applications to genuine $G$-equivariant spaces ($G$ a finite group) and motivic spaces over a perfect field. In particular, we give a proof of the principal fibration lemma in this context. We apply the principal fibration lemma to prove convergence of several kinds of monadic resolutions in unstable equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. For example, we show that, over an algebraically closed field, the unstable Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (i.e., the monadic resolution corresponding to the algebraic cobordism spectrum $\mathrm{MGL}$) converges for all nilpotent, connected, $2$-effective motivic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the flag variety determined by a square matrix $S$ with distinct eigenvalues and a Hessenberg function $h$. The cohomology ring $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is independent of the choice of $S$ and is not explicitly described except for a few cases. In this paper, we characterize the Hessenberg function $h$ such that $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is generated in degree two as a ring. It turns out that such $h$ is what is called a (double) lollipop.</description>

      <title>Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous hypersurfaces with non-isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a pair $(\textbf{X},0)$ and $(\textbf{Y},0)$ of hypersurfaces in $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$ parametrized by finitely determined, quasihomogeneous map germs $f$ and $g,$ respectively. Zariski asked whether the multiplicity is preserved under topological equivalence of hypersurface germs. We address this question within a wide class of $n$-dimensional quasihomogeneous varieties with non-isolated singularities in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1},$ where $2\le n\le 4.$ This class consists of varieties that arise as image of finitely determined, quasihomogeneous map germs. Using a quasihomogeneous normal form, we derive explicit formulas for the multiplicity in terms of the weights and the degrees of the map germ. Our results show that multiplicity, within this setting, is determined by the weighted data and is invariant under topological equivalence, thereby confirming Zariski's multiplicity conjecture and extending current knowledge beyond the isolated singularity case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. We show that the a normalized high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions converges to the Coh zeta function. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $n \geq 1$, we study the fibers of the Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in the plane. For each irreducible component of this fixed point locus, our approach reduces the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, to the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle over an irreducible component of dimension zero in a smaller Hilbert scheme. When $\Gamma$ is of type $A$, our main result shows, as a corollary, that the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with a partition $\lambda$ is induced, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, from the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with the core of $\lambda$. We give different proofs of this corollary in two edge cases, using only representation theory and symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>On reflection maps from the n-space to the n+1-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider some problems about a reflected graph map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$. A reflected graph map is a particular case of a reflection map, which is defined using an embedding of $\mathbb{C}^n$ in $\mathbb{C}^{p}$ and then applying the action of a reflection group $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^{p}$. In this work, we present a description of the presentation matrix of $f_*{\cal O}_n$ as an ${\cal O}_{n+1}$-module via $f$ in terms of the action of the associated reflection group $G$. We also give a description for a defining equation of the image of $f$ in terms of the action of $G$. Finally, we provide an upper (and also a lower) bound for the multiplicity of the image of $f$ and some applications.</description>

Abstract: We give two geometric interpretations for the local type of a line that is highly tangent to a hypersurface in a single point. One interpretation is phrased in terms of the Wronski map, while the other interpretation relates to the fundamental forms of the hypersurface. These local types are the local contributions of an quadratic form-valued Euler number that depends on a choice of orientation.</description>

Abstract: We study the compactification of the moduli space of a certain class of rank-two irregular connections on the Riemann sphere, presenting one double pole and two simple poles. To explicitely build the compactification, we identify a class of such irregular connections with a rational irregular curve and an extra complex parameter. As a first step, we are inspired by Deligne and Mumford's work to compactify the moduli space of rational irregular curves, introducing the notion of irregular stable nodal curve. Second, we will understand the behaviour of the extra complex parameter to conclude the compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic theory of monomial ideals and multigraded modules is initiated over real-exponent polynomial rings and, more generally, monoid algebras for real polyhedral cones. The main results include the generalization of Nakayama's lemma; complete theories of minimal and dense primary, secondary, and irreducible decomposition, including associated and attached faces; socles and tops; minimality and density for downset hulls, upset covers, and fringe presentations; Matlis duality; and geometric analysis of staircases. Modules that are semialgebraic or piecewise-linear (PL) have the relevant property preserved by functorial constructions as well as by minimal primary and secondary decompositions. And when the modules in question are subquotients of the group itself, such as monomial ideals and quotients modulo them, minimal primary and secondary decompositions are canonical, as are irreducible decompositions up to the new real-exponent notion of density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the connected components of arbitrary parahoric level affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties and local Shimura varieties, thus resolving a folklore conjecture in full generality (even for non-quasisplit groups). We achieve this by relating them to the connected components of infinite level moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas, where we use v-sheaf-theoretic techniques such as the specialization map of kimberlites. Along the way, we give a p-adic Hodge-theoretic characterization of HN-irreducibility. As applications, we obtain many results on the geometry of integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type at arbitrary stabilizer-parahoric levels. In particular, we deduce new CM lifting results on integral models of Shimura varieties for quasisplit groups at parahoric levels that arise as stabilizer Bruhat-Tits group schemes.</description>

      <title>Prismatic $F$-gauges and a result of T. Liu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a recent result of Tong Liu, which gives a general control on the torsion in the graded pieces of the so-called integral Hodge filtration associated to a crystalline Galois lattice. Our approach is stack-theoretic, and is inspired on the one hand by a result of Gee--Kisin on the shape of mod $p$ crystalline Breuil--Kisin modules, and on the other hand by the structures seen on the diffracted Hodge complex studied by Bhatt--Lurie. Along the way, we also obtain an explicit description of the Hodge--Tate locus in the Nygaard stack $\mathcal{O}_K^{\mathcal{N}}$ for a general extension $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Motivic configurations on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each configuration of rational points on the affine line, we define an operation on the group of unstable A1 motivic homotopy classes of endomorphisms of the projective line. We also derive an algebraic formula for the image of such an operation under Cazanave and Morel's unstable degree map, which is valued in an extension of the Grothendieck--Witt group. In contrast to the topological setting, these operations depend on the choice of configuration of points via a discriminant. We prove this by first showing a local-to-global formula for the global unstable degree as a modified sum of local terms. We then use an anabelian argument to generalize from the case of local degrees of a global rational function to the case of an arbitrary collection of endomorphisms of the projective line.</description>

      <title>Completely Integrable Foliations: Singular Locus, Invariant Curves and Topological Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study codimension $q \geq 2$ holomorphic foliations defined in a neighborhood of a point $P$ of a complex manifold that are completely integrable, i.e. with $q$ independent meromorphic first integrals. We show that either $P$ is a regular point, a non-isolated singularity or there are infinitely many invariant analytic varieties through $P$ of the same dimension as the foliation, the so called separatrices. Moreover, we see that this phenomenon is of topological nature.
  Indeed, we introduce topological counterparts of completely integrable local holomorphic foliations and tools, specially the concept of total holonomy group, to build holomorphic first integrals if they have isolated separatrices. As a result, we provide a topological characterization of completely integrable non-degenerated elementary isolated singularities of vector fields with an isolated separatrix.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Lagrangian cobordisms, flux and the Lagrangian Ceresa cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an equivalence relation for Lagrangians in a symplectic manifold known as \textit{algebraic Lagrangian cobordism}, which is meant to mirror algebraic equivalence of cycles. From this we prove a symplectic, mirror-symmetric analogue of the statement \enquote{the Ceresa cycle is non-torsion in the Griffiths group of the Jacobian of a generic genus $3$ curve}. Namely, we show that for a family of tropical curves, the \textit{Lagrangian Ceresa cycle}, which is the Lagrangian lift of their tropical Ceresa cycle to the corresponding Lagrangian torus fibration, is non-torsion in its oriented algebraic Lagrangian cobordism group. We proceed by developing the notions of tropical (resp. symplectic) flux, which are morphisms from the tropical Griffiths (resp. algebraic Lagrangian cobordism) groups.</description>

Abstract: This paper re-organizes Vojta's proof of the Mordell conjecture (i.e. Faltings' theorem) in terms of Arakelov geometry. A new ingredient is to replace an application of Gillet--Soule's arithmetic Riemannn--Roch theorem by that of Yuan's arithmetic Siu inequality.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture of Erd\H{o}s over Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Katz's equidistribution framework, we show that for any squarefree polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]$ of degree $n \ge 2$, every residue class modulo $f$ can be represented as a product of two monic irreducible polynomials of degree at most $n$, provided $q$ is sufficiently large in terms of $n$. This gives the function-field analogue of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in the large-$q$ regime.
  Sawin previously proved this representation with stronger square-root cancellation via a higher-dimensional sheaf-theoretic construction. This note presents a one-dimensional argument that yields a natural $q^{-1/2}$ saving.</description>

      <title>On the k-th Milnor and k-th Tjurina Numbers of a Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of the $k$-th Milnor number and the $k$-th Tjurina number for a germ of holomorphic foliation on the complex plane with an isolated singularity at the origin. We develop a detailed study of these invariants, establishing explicit formulas and relating them to other indices associated with holomorphic foliations. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation and, as a consequence, a formula for the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function. We analyze their topological behavior, proving that the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function is a topological invariant, whereas the $k$-th Tjurina number is not. In dimension two, we provide a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Hussain, Liu, Yau, and Zuo concerning a sharp lower bound for the $k$-th Tjurina number of a weighted homogeneous polynomial. We also present a counterexample to another conjecture of Hussain, Yau, and Zuo regarding the ratio between these invariants. Moreover, we establish a fundamental relation linking the $k$-th Tjurina numbers of a foliation and of an invariant curve via the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, and we extend Teissier's Lemma to the setting of $k$-th polar intersection numbers. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation in terms of its $k$-th Tjurina number along balanced divisors of separatrices. Finally, for non-dicritical quasi-homogeneous foliations, we obtain a closed formula for their $k$-th Milnor and Tjurina numbers.</description>

      <title>Bounded ratios for Lorentzian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicative inequalities among entries of Lorentzian matrices, referred to as bounded ratios. These inequalities can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Alexandrov--Fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes. Our main structural result identifies the cone of all bounded ratios on Lorentzian matrices with the dual of the cut cone, a finitely generated integral polyhedral cone extensively studied in metric geometry and graph theory. We examine in detail the pentagonal ratio, which first appears for Lorentzian matrices of size at least five. For Lorentzian matrices of size three, we determine the optimal bounding constants across the entire cone of bounded ratios, obtaining an explicit entropy-like formula. We conjecture that any normalized bounded ratio is, in fact, bounded by 2.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</description>
