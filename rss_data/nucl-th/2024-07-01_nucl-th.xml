      <title>Gamma decay of the $^{154}$Sm Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance: Smekal-Raman Scattering as a Novel Probe of Nuclear Ground-State Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma$ decays of the Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) of the deformed nucleus $^{154}$Sm from $2^+_1$-Smekal-Raman and elastic scattering were measured using linearly polarized, quasi-monochromatic photon beams. The two scattering processes were disentangled through their distinct angular distributions. Their branching ratio and cross sections were determined at six excitation energies covering the $^{154}$Sm GDR. Both agree with the predictions of the geometrical model for the GDR and establish $\gamma$ decay as an observable sensitive to the structure of the resonance. Consequently, the data place strong constraints on the nuclear shape, including the degree of triaxiality. The derived $^{154}$Sm shape parameters $\beta=0.2926(26)$ and $\gamma=5.0(14)$ agree well with other measurements and recent Monte Carlo Shell-Model calculations.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and the Finite Volume Fireball: A Model Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of $K^\ast$ induced by strange-baryon density inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference between the spin alignments of $K^\ast$ and those of $\phi$ at the low collision energies is a puzzle raised by the recent experiments. Unlike $\phi$ meson, $K^\ast$, carrying a unit strange charge, should react to strange chemical potential $\mu_S$. In this paper, we shall first convince you that $\mu_S$ is not small in a brayon-rich medium for keeping strange neutrality, and then derive the spin alignment induced by the gradient of $\mu_S$, and hence of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, using linear response theory, with the transport coefficients expressed, without any approximation, in terms of the $K^\ast$'s in-medium spectral properties by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. It turns out that such an effect applies mainly to the particles whose longitudinal and transverse modes diverge, and induces only the local spin alignment in a static medium. The magnitudes of these coefficients will be further estimated under the quasi-particle approximation.</description>

      <title>Nuclear mass predictions based on convolutional neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to investigate nuclear mass. By introducing the masses of neighboring nuclei and the paring effects at the input layer of the network, local features of the target nucleus are extracted to predict its mass. Then, through learning the differences between the experimental nuclear masses and the predicted nuclear masses by the WS4 model, a new global-local model (CNN-WS4) is developed, which incorporates both the global nuclear mass model and local features. Due to the incorporation of local features, the CNN-WS4 model achieves high accuracy on the training set. When extrapolating for newly emerged nuclei, the CNN-WS4 also exhibits appreciable stability, thereby demonstrating its robustness.</description>

      <title>$K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction with in-flight kaons for studying the $\Lambda N$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra for the reactions $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^-\Lambda p$ and $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^0\Lambda n$ are calculated for experimental study of isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ scattering at low energies, the difference in the scattering lengths and effective ranges of $\Lambda p$ and $\Lambda n$ systems. The calculations are performed for in-flight kaons with a momentum of 1000 MeV/c with employing partial wave analysis up to the p-wave for meson-baryon amplitudes and the spin-flip term for baryon-baryon amplitudes. Kinematic selection is utilized to suppress the background processes by selecting forward-emitting pions and higher momentum nucleons. It is worth noting that isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ system can be extracted from the difference of the $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra between the $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^-\Lambda p$ and $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^0\Lambda n$ reactions.</description>

      <title>Two-center harmonic oscillator basis for Skyrme-DFT calculations (I): formalism and Proof of Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to solve the nuclear density functional theory (DFT) equations using a two-center harmonic oscillator basis, incorporating pairing and Coulomb interactions. The goal is to efficiently determine the fission and fusion configurations in nuclei. The Coulomb exchange terms are evaluated exactly, allowing for a novel approach to neck formation without the Slater approximation, which has been commonly used in space coordinate-based approaches. The new method has been implemented in the code {\sc hfodd}, enabling direct comparison with standard one-center solutions. This first paper focuses on deriving and implementing a methodology based on stable, precise, and exact applications of harmonic oscillator bases for the two fragments, which can either overlap or be separated by arbitrarily large distances. The implementation is tested on two proof-of-principle examples using light nuclei, specifically $^8$Be and $^{24}$Mg.</description>

      <title>Power Counting to Saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a description of saturation in small $x$ deep inelastic scattering from power counting in a top-down effective theory derived from QCD. A factorization formula isolates the universal physics of the nucleus at leading power in $x$. The onset of saturation is then understood as a breakdown in the expansion in an emergent power counting parameter, which is defined by the matrix element of a gauge invariant operator. We identify a new radiation mode, which enables us to extend previous literature by distinguishing the appearance of the saturation scale from the transition to non-linear evolution.</description>

      <title>Constraining kaon PDFs from Drell-Yan and $J/\psi$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are poorly known due to paucity of kaon-induced Drell-Yan data. Nevertheless, these Drell-Yan data suggest a softer valence $u$ quark distribution of kaon than that of pion. We discuss the opportunity to constrain kaon PDFs utilizing existing kaon-induced $J/\psi$ production data. We compare the $K^- / \pi^-$ and $K^+ / \pi^+$ cross-section ratio data with calculations based on two global-fit parametrizations and two recent theoretical predictions for the kaon and pion PDFs, and test the results with two quarkonium production models. The $K^- / \pi^-$ cross-section ratio for $J/\psi$ production provides independent evidence of different valence quark distributions in pion and kaon. The $K^+ / \pi^+$ $J/\psi$ data are found to be sensitive to the gluon distribution in kaon. We show that these $J/\psi$ production data provide valuable constraints for evaluating the adequacy of currently available sets of kaon PDFs.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Rastall gravity: hydrostatic equilibrium and radial pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of Rastall gravity, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability against radial pulsations of compact stars, where a free parameter $\beta$ measures the deviations from General Relativity (GR). We derive both the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and the Sturm-Liouville differential equation governing the adiabatic radial oscillations. Such equations are solved numerically in order to obtain the compact-star properties for two realistic equations of state (EoSs). For hadronic matter, the fundamental mode frequency $\omega_0$ becomes unstable almost at the critical central energy density corresponding to the maximum gravitational mass. However, for quark matter, where larger values of $\vert\beta\vert$ are required to observe appreciable changes in the mass-radius diagram, there exist stable stars after the maximum-mass configuration for negative values of $\beta$. Using an independent analysis, our results reveal that the emergence of a cusp can be used as a criterion to indicate the onset of instability when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to $\omega_0^2 =0$.</description>
