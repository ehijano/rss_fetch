      <title>StraTyper: Automated Semantic Type Discovery and Multi-Type Annotation for Dataset Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding dataset semantics is crucial for effective search, discovery, and integration pipelines. To this end, column type annotation (CTA) methods associate columns of tabular datasets with semantic types that accurately describe their contents, using pre-trained deep learning models or Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches require users to specify a closed set of semantic types either at training or inference time, hindering their application to domain-specific datasets where pre-defined labels often lack adequate coverage and specificity. Furthermore, real-world datasets frequently contain columns with values belonging to multiple semantic types, violating the single-type assumption of existing CTA methods. While proprietary LLMs have shown effectiveness for CTA, they incur high monetary costs and produce inconsistent outputs for similar columns, leading to type redundancy that negatively affects downstream applications. To address these challenges, we introduce StraTyper, a cost-effective method for column type discovery (CTD) and multi-type annotation (CMTA) in dataset collections. StraTyper eliminates the need for pre-defined semantic labels by systematically employing LLMs to discovery types tailored to the dataset collection at hand. Through strategic column clustering, controlled type generation, and iterative cascading discovery, StraTyper balances type precision with annotation coverage while minimizing LLM costs. Our experimental evaluation-both manual and LLM-assisted-on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that StraTyper discovers accurate types for both numerical and non-numerical data, achieves substantial cost savings compared to commercial LLMs, and effectively handles multi-typed columns. We further show that StraTyper's annotations improve downstream tasks, including join discovery and schema matching, outperforming LLM-only baselines.</description>

      <title>PluRel: Synthetic Data unlocks Scaling Laws for Relational Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) facilitate data-driven decision-making by learning from complex multi-table databases. However, the diverse relational databases needed to train such models are rarely public due to privacy constraints. While there are methods to generate synthetic tabular data of arbitrary size, incorporating schema structure and primary--foreign key connectivity for multi-table generation remains challenging. Here we introduce PluRel, a framework to synthesize multi-tabular relational databases from scratch. In a step-by-step fashion, PluRel models (1) schemas with directed graphs, (2) inter-table primary-foreign key connectivity with bipartite graphs, and, (3) feature distributions in tables via conditional causal mechanisms. The design space across these stages supports the synthesis of a wide range of diverse databases, while being computationally lightweight. Using PluRel, we observe for the first time that (1) RFM pretraining loss exhibits power-law scaling with the number of synthetic databases and total pretraining tokens, (2) scaling the number of synthetic databases improves generalization to real databases, and (3) synthetic pretraining yields strong base models for continued pretraining on real databases. Overall, our framework and results position synthetic data scaling as a promising paradigm for RFMs.</description>

      <title>Piece of CAKE: Adaptive Execution Engines via Microsecond-Scale Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-level database operators often admit multiple physical implementations ("kernels") that are semantically equivalent but have vastly different performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution. Existing database systems typically rely on static heuristics or worst-case optimal defaults to select these kernels, often missing significant performance opportunities. In this work, we propose CAKE (Counterfactual Adaptive Kernel Execution), a system that learns to select the optimal kernel for each data "morsel" using a microsecond-scale contextual multi-armed bandit. CAKE circumvents the high latency of traditional reinforcement learning by exploiting the cheapness of counterfactuals -- selectively running multiple kernels to obtain full feedback -- and compiling policies into low-latency regret trees. Experimentally, we show that CAKE can reduce end-to-end workload latency by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art static heuristics.</description>

      <title>LatentTune: Efficient Tuning of High Dimensional Database Parameters via Latent Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data volumes continue to grow, optimizing database performance has become increasingly critical, making the implementation of effective tuning methods essential. Among various approaches, database parameter tuning has proven to be a highly effective means of enhancing performance. Recent studies have shown that machine learning techniques can successfully optimize database parameters, leading to significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, they require substantial time to generate large training datasets. Second, to cope with the challenges of highdimensional optimization, they typically optimize only a subset of parameters rather than the full configuration space. Third, they often rely on information from similar workloads instead of directly leveraging information from the target workload. To address these limitations, we propose LatentTune, a novel approach that differs fundamentally from traditional methods. To reduce the time required for data generation, LatentTune incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Furthermore, it constructs a latent space that compresses information from all database parameters, enabling the optimization of the full configuration space. In addition, LatentTune integrates external metric information into the latent space, allowing for precise tuning tailored to the actual target workload. Experimental results demonstrate that LatentTune outperforms baseline models across four workloads on MySQL and RocksDB, achieving up to 1332% improvement for RocksDB and 11.82% throughput gain with 46.01% latency reduction for MySQL.</description>

      <title>Data Agents: Levels, State of the Art, and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data agents are an emerging paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) and tool-using agents to automate data management, preparation, and analysis tasks. However, the term "data agent" is currently used inconsistently, conflating simple query responsive assistants with aspirational fully autonomous "data scientists". This ambiguity blurs capability boundaries and accountability, making it difficult for users, system builders, and regulators to reason about what a "data agent" can and cannot do.
  In this tutorial, we propose the first hierarchical taxonomy of data agents from Level 0 (L0, no autonomy) to Level 5 (L5, full autonomy). Building on this taxonomy, we will introduce a lifecycleand level-driven view of data agents. We will (1) present the L0-L5 taxonomy and the key evolutionary leaps that separate simple assistants from truly autonomous data agents, (2) review representative L0-L2 systems across data management, preparation, and analysis, (3) highlight emerging Proto-L3 systems that strive to autonomously orchestrate end-to-end data workflows to tackle diverse and comprehensive data-related tasks under supervision, and (4) discuss forward-looking research challenges towards proactive (L4) and generative (L5) data agents. We aim to offer both a practical map of today's systems and a research roadmap for the next decade of data-agent development.</description>

      <title>Identifying knowledge gaps in biodiversity data and their determinants at the regional level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity open-access databases are valuable resources in the structuring and accessibility of species occurrence data. By compiling different data sources, they reveal the uneven spatial distribution of knowledge, with areas or taxonomic groups better prospected than others. Understanding the determinants of spatial and taxonomic knowledge gaps helps in informing the use of open-access data. Here, we identified knowledge gaps' determinants within a French regional biodiversity database, in the largest administrative region in France. Knowledge gaps were assessed using two metrics, completeness and ignorance scores, for 8 taxonomic groups covering five vertebrates and three invertebrates groups. The data was analyzed for the entire region, but also at the level of the three former sub-regions, to identify the potential drivers that may account for knowledge gaps' determinants. Our findings show that invertebrates were characterized by higher knowledge gaps than vertebrates. Overall, knowledge gaps are influenced by variables related to sites' accessibility rather than ecological appeal across both metrics. All groups shared similar determinants of gaps, except for the impact of agricultural pressure which is found to be more significant for invertebrates than vertebrates. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the impact of biodiversity governance, through local funding and regional political decisions, on knowledge distribution in open-access databases. We recommend limiting these biases by redirecting biodiversity funding towards under-sampled taxonomic groups and under-prospected areas. When not possible, users of data extracted from these databases should correct for spatial-sampling biases (SSP) using knowledge gaps' maps in order to get a more accurate understanding of species occurrence.</description>

      <title>The Stretto Execution Engine for LLM-Augmented Data Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-augmented data systems enable semantic querying over structured and unstructured data, but executing queries with LLM-powered operators introduces a fundamental runtime--accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we present Stretto, a new execution engine that provides end-to-end query guarantees while efficiently navigating this trade-off in a holistic manner. For this, Stretto formulates query planning as a constrained optimization problem and uses a gradient-based optimizer to jointly select operator implementations and allocate error budgets across pipelines. Moreover, to enable fine-grained execution choices, Stretto introduces a novel idea on how KV-caching can be used to realize a spectrum of different physical operators that transform a sparse design space into a dense continuum of runtime--accuracy trade-offs. Experiments show that Stretto outperforms state-of-the-art systems while consistently meeting quality guarantees.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Survey and Benchmark of Learned Distance Indexes for Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.</description>

      <title>A Chase-based Approach to Consistent Answers of Analytic Queries in Star Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to computing consistent answers to queries possibly involving an aggregation operator in databases operating under a star schema and possibly containing missing values and inconsistent data. Our approach is based on earlier work concerning consistent query answering for standard queries (with no aggregate operator) in multi-table databases. In that work, we presented polynomial algorithms for computing either the exact consistent answer to a query or bounds of the exact answer, depending on whether the query involves a selection condition or not.
  In the present work, we consider databases operating under a star schema. Calling data warehouses such databases, we extend our previous work to queries involving aggregate operators, called analytic queries. In this context, we propose specific algorithms for computing exact consistent answers to queries, whether analytic or not, provided that the selection condition in the query satisfies the property of independency (i.e., the condition can be expressed as a conjunction of conditions each involving a single attribute). We show that the overall time complexity of these specific algorithms is in O(W.log(W)), where W is the size of the data warehouse. Moreover, the case of analytic queries involving a having clause associated with a group-by clause is discussed in the context of our approach.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated ANNS: Quantized for Speed, Built for Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a core problem in machine learning and information retrieval applications. GPUs offer a promising path to high-performance ANNS: they provide massive parallelism for distance computations, are readily available, and can co-locate with downstream applications.
  Despite these advantages, current GPU-accelerated ANNS systems face three key limitations. First, real-world applications operate on evolving datasets that require fast batch updates, yet most GPU indices must be rebuilt from scratch when new data arrives. Second, high-dimensional vectors strain memory bandwidth, but current GPU systems lack efficient quantization techniques that reduce data movement without introducing costly random memory accesses. Third, the data-dependent memory accesses inherent to greedy search make overlapping compute and memory difficult, leading to reduced performance.
  We present Jasper, a GPU-native ANNS system with both high query throughput and updatability. Jasper builds on the Vamana graph index and overcomes existing bottlenecks via three contributions: (1) a CUDA batch-parallel construction algorithm that enables lock-free streaming insertions, (2) a GPU-efficient implementation of RaBitQ quantization that reduces memory footprint up to 8x without the random access penalties, and (3) an optimized greedy search kernel that increases compute utilization, resulting in better latency hiding and higher throughput.
  Our evaluation across five datasets shows that Jasper achieves up to 1.93x higher query throughput than CAGRA and achieves up to 80% peak utilization as measured by the roofline model. Jasper's construction scales efficiently and constructs indices an average of 2.4x faster than CAGRA while providing updatability that CAGRA lacks. Compared to BANG, the previous fastest GPU Vamana implementation, Jasper delivers 19-131x faster queries.</description>

      <title>Tidehunter: Large-Value Storage With Minimal Data Relocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Log-Structured Merge-Trees (LSM-trees) dominate persistent key-value storage but suffer from high write amplification from 10x to 30x under random workloads due to repeated compaction. This overhead becomes prohibitive for large values with uniformly distributed keys, a workload common in content-addressable storage, deduplication systems, and blockchain validators. We present Tidehunter, a storage engine that eliminates value compaction by treating the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) as permanent storage rather than a temporary recovery buffer. Values are never overwritten; and small, lazily-flushed index tables map keys to WAL positions. Tidehunter introduces (a) lock-free writes that saturate NVMe drives through atomic allocation and parallel copying, (b) an optimistic index structure that exploits uniform key distributions for single-roundtrip lookups, and (c) epoch-based pruning that reclaims space without blocking writes. On a 1 TB dataset with 1 KB values, Tidehunter achieves 830K writes per second, that is 8.4x higher than RocksDB and 2.9x higher than BlobDB, while improving point queries by 1.7x and existence checks by 15.6x. We validate real-world impact by integrating Tidehunter into Sui, a high-throughput blockchain, where it maintains stable throughput and latency under loads that cause RocksDB-backed validators to collapse. Tidehunter is production-ready and is being deployed in production within Sui.</description>
