      <title>Permutation Models of Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G\"unter Asser (1981) introduced second-order permutation models. In this way, the Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker method for defining models of ZFA was transferred to a new application area. To investigate the strength of second-order principles of choice in second-order predicate logic (PLII) with Henkin interpretation (HPL), we have extended the Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker-Asser method. Here we discuss many details, including some useful references. Finally, we address a question raised by Stephen Mackereth.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard polynomials: algebraic properties and elementary equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the first-order classification problem for rings $R$ of polynomials $F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ and Laurent polynomials $F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ with coefficients in an infinite field $F$ or the ring of integers $\mathbb Z$, that is, we describe the algebraic structure of all rings $S$ that are first-order equivalent to $R$. Our approach is based on a new and very powerful method of regular bi-interpretations, or more precisely, regular invertible interpretations. Namely, we prove that $F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ and $F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ are regularly bi-interpretable with the list superstructure $\mathbb S(F,\mathbb N)$ of $F$, which is equivalent to regular bi-interpretation with the superstructure $HF(F)$ of hereditary finite sets over $F$. The expressive power of $\mathbb S(F,\mathbb N)$ is the same as that of the weak second-order logic over $F$. Hence, the first-order logic in $R = F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ or $R = F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ is equivalent to the weak second-order logic in $F$ (following the terminology of Kharlampovich, Myasnikov, and Sohrabi [16], such structures are necessarily rich), which allows one to describe the algebraic structure of all rings $S$ with $S\equiv R$. In fact, these rings $S$ are precisely the ``non-standard'' models of $R$, like in non-standard arithmetic or non-standard analysis. This is particularly straightforward when $F$ is regularly bi-interpretable with $\mathbb N$, in this case the ring $R$ is also bi-interpretable with $\mathbb N$. Using our approach, we describe various, sometimes rather surprising, algebraic and model-theoretic properties of the non-standard models of $R$.</description>

      <title>Local Tabularity is Decidable for Bi-Intermediate Logics of Trees and of Co-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-Heyting algebra validates the G\"odel-Dummett axiom $(p\to q)\vee (q\to p)$ iff the poset of its prime filters is a disjoint union of co-trees (i.e., order duals of trees). Bi-Heyting algebras of this kind are called bi-G\"odel algebras and form a variety that algebraizes the extension $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GD}}$ of bi-intuitionistic logic axiomatized by the G\"odel-Dummett axiom. In this paper we establish the decidability of the problem of determining if a finitely axiomatizable extension of $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GD}}$ is locally tabular.
  Notably, if $L$ is an extension of $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GD}}$, then $L$ is locally tabular iff $L$ is not contained in $Log(FC)$, the logic of a particular family of finite co-trees, called the finite combs. We prove that $Log(FC)$ is finitely axiomatizable. Since this logic also has the finite model property, it is therefore decidable. Thus, the above characterization of local tabularity ensures the decidability of the aforementioned problem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Epstein semantics for Parry systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I introduce a generalized version of Richard Epstein's set-assignment semantics ([Epstein, 1990]). As a case study, I consider how this framework can be used to characterize William Parry's logic of analytic implication and some of its recent variations proposed by [Ferguson, 2023a]. In generalized Epstein semantics the parallel use of two algebras, one for extensional and the other for intensional values, allows to account for various forms of content sharing between formulae, which motivates the choice to investigate Parry systems. Hilbert-style axiomatizations and completeness proofs will be presented for all the considered calculi, in particular as main result I provide a set-assignment semantics for Parry's logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a finitely generated group which is not virtually free, yet has decidable snake tiling problem. This shows that either a long-standing conjecture by Ballier and Stein (the characterization of groups with decidable domino problem as those virtually free ones) is false, or a question by Aubrun and Bitar has a positive answer (there exists a group for which the domino and snake problems are of different difficulty).</description>

      <title>Completeness of coalition logics with seriality, independence of agents, or determinism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In a recent paper, Li and Ju argued that generally, models of Coalition Logic, concurrent game models, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented a Minimal Coalition Logic based on general concurrent game models, which do not have the three assumptions. However, when constructing coalition logics about strategic reasoning in special kinds of situations, we may want to keep some of the assumptions. Thus, studying coalition logics with some of these assumptions makes good sense. In this paper, we show the completeness of these coalition logics by a uniform approach.</description>

      <title>Syntax and semantics of multi-adjoint normal logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-adjoint logic programming is a general framework with interesting features, which involves other positive logic programming frameworks such as monotonic and residuated logic programming, generalized annotated logic programs, fuzzy logic programming and possibilistic logic programming. One of the most interesting extensions of this framework is the possibility of considering a negation operator in the logic programs, which will improve its flexibility and the range of real applications.
  This paper introduces multi-adjoint normal logic programming, which is an extension of multi-adjoint logic programming including a negation operator in the underlying lattice. Beside the introduction of the syntax and semantics of this paradigm, we will provide sufficient conditions for the existence of stable models defined on a convex compact set of a euclidean space. Finally, we will consider a particular algebraic structure in which sufficient conditions can be given in order to ensure the unicity of stable models of multi-adjoint normal logic programs.</description>

      <title>$\leq_{SP}$ Can Have Infinitely Many Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.08523v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building off of recent results on Keisler's order, we show that consistently, $\leq_{SP}$ has infinitely many classes. In particular, we define the property of $\leq k$-type amalgamation for simple theories, for each $2 \leq k &lt; \omega$. If we let $T_{n, k}$ be the theory of the random $k$-ary, $n$-clique free random hyper-graph, then $T_{n, k}$ has $\leq k-1$-type amalgamation but not $\leq k$-type amalgamation. We show that consistently, if $T$ has $\leq k$-type amalgamation then $T_{k+1, k} \not \leq_{SP} T$, thus producing infinitely many $\leq_{SP}$-classes. The same construction gives a simplified proof of Shelah's theorem that consistently, the maximal $\leq_{SP}$-class is exactly the class of unsimple theories. Finally, we show that consistently, if $T$ has $&lt;\aleph_0$-type amalgamation, then $T \leq_{SP} T_{rg}$, the theory of the random graph.</description>

      <title>Categorifying computable reducibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents categorical formulations of Turing, Medvedev, Muchnik, and Weihrauch reducibilities in Computability Theory, utilizing Lawvere doctrines. While the first notions lend themselves to a smooth categorical presentation, essentially dualizing the traditional idea of realizability doctrines, Weihrauch reducibility and its extensions to represented and multi-represented spaces require a separate investigation. Our abstract analysis of these concepts highlights a shared characteristic among all these reducibilities. Specifically, we demonstrate that all these doctrines stemming from computability concepts can be proven to be instances of completions of quantifiers for doctrines, analogous to what occurs for doctrines for realizability. As a corollary of these results, we will be able to formally compare Weihrauch reducibility with the dialectica doctrine constructed from a doctrine representing Turing degrees.</description>

      <title>Librationist and classic set theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11859v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A librationist set theory \pounds ${}$ is developed. It descends from semantics for truth, initiated by by Kripke, Herzberger, Gupta and others. # extends the system \pounds, of Librationist closures of the paradoxes in Logic and Logical Philosophy 21(4), 323-361, 2012. The focus is upon the paradoxes in theories of sets. A central result is that the extension #$\mathscr{HR}(\mathbf{D})$, of #, accounts for $\mathbf{NBG}$ set theory, with the global Axiom of Choice and Tarski's Axiom. Moreover, # also succeeds with defining an impredicative manifestation set $\mathbf{W}$, $\mathit{die \ Welt}$, so that #$\mathscr{H}(\mathbf{W})$ accounts for Quine's $\mathbf{NF}$. Nevertheless, the points of view developed support the view that the truth-paradoxes and the set-paradoxes have common origins, so that the librationist resolutions of the set theoretic paradoxes at the same time are resolutions of the truth theoretic paradoxes. Both the librationist resolutions of the set theoretic paradoxes and the truth theoretic paradoxes have non-trivial implications: librationist set theories have the consequence that there are no absolutely uncountable sets, and librationist truth theories allow the use of syntactical modalities in ways which circumvent well known limitations, first pointed out by Montague in 1963. So librationism has a truth predicate which is useful for more precise discourse, and # retains the ideology of the author's 2012 article, that the set theoretic universe is countable. But the set within which $\mathbf{NBG}$ is interpreted "believes" that there are sets which are uncountable. The situation is analyzed much as by Skolem, though it is not suggested that the notion of $\mathit{set}$ is imprecise: for the bijection from the set of finite von Neumann ordinals to the full universe is not a member of a classical set theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feferman proved in 1962 that any arithmetical theorem is a consequence of a suitable transfinite iteration of full uniform reflection of $\mathsf{PA}$. This result is commonly known as Feferman's completeness theorem. The purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand this is an expository paper, giving two new proofs of Feferman's completeness theorem that, we hope, shed light on this mysterious and often overlooked result. On the other hand, we combine one of our proofs with results from computable structure theory due to Ash and Knight to give sharp bounds on the order types of well-orders necessary to attain the completeness for levels of the arithmetical hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the projective Fra\"{\i}ss\'e family of finite connected graphs with confluent epimorphisms and the continuum obtained as the topological realization of its projective Fra\"{\i}ss\'e limit. This continuum was unknown before. We prove that it is indecomposable, but not hereditarily indecomposable, one-dimensional, Kelley, pointwise self-homeomorphic, but not homogeneous. It is hereditarily unicoherent and each point is the top of the Cantor fan. Moreover, the universal solenoid, the universal pseudo-solenoid, and the pseudo-arc may be embedded in it.</description>
