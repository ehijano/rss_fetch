      <title>Geometric Bound for Trade-off Relation in Quantum Tricycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a finite-time quantum tricycle driven by an external field and investigate its thermodynamic performance in the slow-driving regime. By developing a perturbative expansion of heat with respect to operation time, we capture the dynamics of heat exchange processes beyond the quasistatic limit. Within a geometric framework, we derive fundamental bounds on trade-offs between the cooling rate, coefficient of performance, and dissipation, governed by the thermodynamic length and trajectory geometry in control space. Our findings unveil intrinsic limits to the performance of quantum thermal machines and highlight the role of geometry in shaping finite-time thermodynamics. This work advances the fundamental understanding of quantum thermodynamic processes and offers guiding principles for the design of next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum Mpemba effect in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Censorship of quantum resources against catalytic account sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum censorship, an agency oversees quantum communication in a public-domain network. The agency restricts the users communication to the free states of a quantum resource theory (QRT). Despite quantum correlations being fragile, any realistic censorship leaves behind some quantumness, raising concerns that censorship may be overcome through revival or distillation of quantum resources. Here, we introduce censorship protocols that do not require a perfect erasure of a quantum resource, but rather deem censorship successful if users are unable to restore the original quantum state using free operations. We investigate under which conditions censorship is secure, and when it might fail. Moreover, we address the issue of account sharing in quantum networks, wherein independent parties assist in transmitting quantum resources to censored users. This connects resource censorship to timely topics such as quantum catalysis and resource-assisted communication. Censorship protocols offer a novel perspective on quantum network security, that differs fundamentally from existing approaches such as quantum and post-quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Statistical phase-space complexity of continuous-variable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical complexity of continuous-variable quantum states can be characterized with a quantifier defined in terms of information-theoretic quantities derived from the Husimi Q-function. In this work, we utilize this complexity quantifier of quantum states to study the complexity of single-mode bosonic quantum channels. We define the complexity of quantum channels as the maximal amount of complexity they can generate from an initial state with the minimal complexity. We illustrate this concept by evaluating the complexity of Gaussian channels and some examples of non-Gaussian channels.</description>

      <title>Can outcome communication explain Bell nonlocality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central aspect of quantum information is that correlations between spacelike separated observers sharing entangled states cannot be reproduced by local hidden variable (LHV) models, a phenomenon known as Bell nonlocality. If one wishes to explain such correlations by classical means, a natural possibility is to allow communication between the parties. In particular, LHV models augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the correlations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is restricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite number of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all projective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In fact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with outcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without communication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of measurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in the upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an advantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios, such as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role in the outcome communication scenario.</description>

      <title>Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</description>

      <title>Probing non-Markovian qubit noise and modeling Post Markovian Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation (PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution in the Iberian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising use of quantum networking is quantum key distribution (QKD), which can provide information-theoretic security unattainable by classical means. While optical fiber-based QKD networks suffer from exponential loss, satellite-assisted quantum communication offers a scalable solution for long-distance secure key exchange. In this work, we propose and evaluate a satellite-based QKD setup covering the Iberian Peninsula, linking Madrid with Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Our proposed setup uses a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) state-of-the-art satellite equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source to distribute entangled photon pairs to ground stations. Considering vibrations in the satellite, we optimize the beam waist to enhance the transmission probability and improve the secret key rate (SKR). Our results show that key rates sufficient for real-world applications, such as secure communication between hospitals, using hybrid classical-quantum protocols are feasible with existing protocols. Our results highlight the viability of near-term satellite-based QKD networks for national-scale secure communications.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Free Fidelity Estimation via Quantum Output Order Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation-free method to estimate the fidelity of large quantum circuits based on the order statistics of measured output probabilities from highly entangled, chaotic states. The approach requires only the highest-probability output bitstrings -- the most frequently observed measurement outcomes -- and builds on exact analytical results for the order statistics of Haar-random quantum states derived here. Analyzing their modification under depolarizing noise, we propose a scalable fidelity estimator, validated on Google's 12-qubit Sycamore experiment and further supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate its practicality for intermediate-scale quantum circuits, where cross-entropy benchmarking is costly and direct fidelity estimation is difficult.</description>

      <title>Blind-spots of Randomized Benchmarking Under Temporal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a widely adopted protocol for estimating the average gate fidelity in quantum hardware. However, its standard formulation relies on the assumption of temporally uncorrelated noise, an assumption often violated in current devices. In this work, we derive analytic expressions for the average sequence fidelity (ASF) in the presence of temporally correlated (non-Markovian) noise with classical memory, including cases where such correlations originate from interactions with a quantum environment. We show how the ASF can be interpreted to extract meaningful benchmarking parameters under such noise and identify classes of interaction Hamiltonians that render temporal correlations completely invisible to RB. We further provide operational criteria for witnessing temporal correlations due to quantum memory through RB experiments. Importantly, while classical correlations may remain undetectable in the ASF data, they can nonetheless significantly affect worst-case errors quantified by the diamond norm, a metric central to fault tolerant quantum computing. In particular, we demonstrate that temporal correlations may suppress worst-case errors highlighting that temporal correlations may not always have detrimental effects on gate performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal key rates for quantum key distribution with partial source characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical security proofs based on conic optimization are known to deliver optimal secret-key rates, but so far they have mostly assumed that the emitted states are fully characterized. In practice, this assumption is unrealistic, since real devices inevitably suffer from imperfections and side channels that are extremely difficult to model in detail. Here, we extend conic-optimization methods to scenarios where only partial information about the emitted states is known, covering both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent protocols. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art analytical and numerical approaches under realistic source imperfections, especially for protocols that use non-qubit encodings. These results advance numerical-based proofs towards a standard, implementation-ready framework for evaluating quantum key distribution protocols in the presence of source imperfections.</description>

      <title>Software-enhanced simultaneous quantum-classical communication protocol with Gaussian post-selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous quantum-classical communication (SQCC) protocols offer a practical approach to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) by encoding quantum and classical signals onto the same optical pulse. However, like most QKD protocols, their performance is limited when experimental parameters, such as modulation variance, are optimised based on stationary channel assumptions. In fluctuating environments, such as free-space links, this can result in sub-optimal key rates and reduced transmission distances. In this work, we introduce Gaussian post-selection into the SQCC framework, enabling a software-based optimisation of the modulation variance after channel estimation. This passive approach enhances key rates in both asymptotic and finite-size regimes without requiring hardware modifications and remains effective even when receiver imperfections are taken into account. We demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves the transmission distance and robustness of SQCC across both fibre and free-space channels. In particular, we show that the protocol enables full communication windows under ideal weather conditions and maintains higher duty cycles during adverse weather in satellite-to-ground scenarios. These results highlight the practicality of post-selection based SQCC for real-world quantum communication over both terrestrial fiber networks and satellite-based free-space links.</description>

The long-time behavior of the evolution operator governing the dynamics of both the system and the environment is analyzed, and the conditions under which the system approaches thermal equilibrium are examined.</description>

      <title>Autler-Townes spectroscopy of a Rydberg ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nonlinear Spin Dynamics in Dual-Cell Atomic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spin systems exhibit rich and exotic dynamical phenomena, offering promising applications ranging from spin masers and time crystals to precision measurement. Recent theoretical work [T. Wang et al., Commun. Phys. 8, 41 (2025)] predicted intriguing nonlinear dynamical phases arising from inhomogeneous magnetic fields and feedback interactions. However, experimental exploration of these predictions remains lacking. Here, we report the observation of nonlinear spin dynamics in dual-bias magnetic fields with dual-cell alkali-metal atomic gases and present three representative stable dynamical behaviors of limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos. Additionally, we probe the nonlinear phase transitions between these phases by varying the feedback gain and the difference of dual-bias magnetic fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the limit cycle and quasi-periodic orbit against the noise of magnetic fields. Our findings establish a versatile platform for exploring complex spin dynamics and open new avenues for the realization of multimode spin masers, time crystals and quasi-crystals, and high-precision magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Agency cannot be a purely quantum phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the physical requirements for agency? We investigate whether a purely quantum system (one evolving unitarily in a coherent regime without decoherence or collapse) can satisfy three minimal conditions for agency: an agent must be able to create a world-model, use it to evaluate the likely consequences of alternative actions, and reliably perform the action that maximizes expected utility. We show that the first two conditions conflict with the no-cloning theorem, which forbids copying unknown quantum states: world-model construction requires copying information from the environment, and deliberation requires copying the world-model to assess multiple actions. Approximate cloning strategies do not permit sufficient fidelity or generality for agency to be viable in purely quantum systems. The third agency condition also fails due to the linearity of quantum dynamics. These results imply four key consequences. First, agency requires significant classical resources, placing clear constraints on its physical basis. Second, they provide insight into how classical agents emerge within a quantum universe. Third, they show that quantum computers cannot straightforwardly simulate agential behavior without significant classical components. Finally, they challenge quantum theories of agency, free will, and consciousness.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement and Nonlocality of Nearly Symmetric Multiqubit Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether every pure genuinely multipartite entangled (GME) state necessarily exhibits genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) remains an open question. By combining a recently proposed Bell inequality [I. Stachura \textit{et al.}, \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ad7753}{New J. Phys. \textbf{26}, 093029 (2024)}] with Hardy's paradox and the canonical decomposition of pure states, we analytically demonstrate that all highly symmetric, genuinely entangled multipartite qubit states exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality, thereby supporting Gisin's conjecture in the multipartite setting. This result constitutes a step toward a general proof of the conjectured equivalence between GME and GMNL in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Boson Sampling-Neural Network Architecture for Enhanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstration of quantum advantage for classical machine learning tasks remains a central goal for quantum technologies and artificial intelligence. Two major bottlenecks to this goal are the high dimensionality of practical datasets and limited performance of near-term quantum computers. Boson sampling is among the few models with experimentally verified quantum advantage, yet it lacks practical applications. Here, we develop a hybrid framework that combines the computational power of boson sampling with the adaptability of neural networks to construct quantum kernels that enhance support vector machine classification. The neural network adaptively compresses the data features onto a programmable boson sampling circuit, producing quantum states that span a high-dimensional Hilbert space and enable improved classification performance. Using four datasets with various classes, we demonstrate that our model outperforms classical linear and sigmoid kernels. These results highlight the potential of boson sampling-based quantum kernels for practical quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Homodyne Measurement of a Non-Hermitian Qubit Undergoing Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementation of a two-level non-Hermitian qubit via postselection of a three-level system has been demonstrated. The postselection procedure, which discards quantum jump to the ground-state manifold while retaining excitations in the first and second excited-state manifolds, effectively generates a non-Hermitian qubit exhibiting PT symmetry. In this work, we perform continuous homodyne mea- surement of this non-Hermitian qubit and analyze the interplay between decay introduced by posts- election and measurement backaction. We compare the ensemble-averaged dynamics obtained from measurement trajectories with the the Liouvillian average. We formulate the no-jump stochastic differential equation describing the postselected non-Hermitian qubit and show that its ensemble- averaged dynamics agree with those of the jump-updated postselected evolution at drive strengths far from the Liouvillian exceptional point (EP). The degree of deviation near the EP depends sensitively on the nature of the drive. This discrepancy is attributed to the interplay between measurement backaction and the non-Hermitian decay introduced by postselection. Furthermore, we determine the optimal path of the non-Hermitian qubit by extremizing the action within the path-integral formulation of the quantum trajectory framework Our results provide insights into how measurement backaction and non-Hermitian dynamics together shape the transient behavior of open quantum systems and enable controlled manipulation of qubits near exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Detection in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the massive multiple-input and multiple-output (Massive MIMO) systems, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem is NP-hard and becoming classically intricate with the number of the transmitting antennas and the symbols increasing. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), a leading candidate algorithm running in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, can show quantum advantage for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose the QAOA based the maximum likelihood detection solver of binary symbols. In proposed scheme, we first conduct a universal and compact analytical expression for the expectation value of the 1-level QAOA. Second, a bayesian optimization based parameters initialization is presented, which can speedup the convergence of the QAOA to a lower local minimum and improve the probability of measuring the exact solution. Compared to the state-of-the-art QAOA based ML detection algorithm, our scheme have the more universal and compact expectation value expression of the 1-level QAOA, and requires few quantum resources and has the higher probability to obtain the exact solution.</description>

      <title>Efficient lambda-enhanced gray molasses using an EIT-based laser locking scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of lambda-enhanced gray molasses cooling in a non-standard beam geometry and with an inexpensive laser locking set-up. In contrast to the established use of resource-intensive phase locking methods, our laser system uses two independent lasers, frequency -locked to a spectral feature produced by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) resonance. We show that this approach achieves sufficient coherence to enable effective gray molasses cooling without the need for costly GHz electronics, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of experimental setups and represents a step toward more accessible cold atom technologies. A wave-function Monte Carlo analysis supports the experimental findings, offering insight into the cooling dynamics of this unconventional scheme</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of Gate-Based and Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct comparison between gate-based quantum computing (GQC) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) for solving the AC power flow (PF) equations. Building on the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) algorithm originally designed for annealing platforms, we adapt it to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The PF equations are reformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Numerical experiments on a 4-bus test system assess solution accuracy and computational time. Results from QAOA are benchmarked against those obtained using D-Wave's Advantage system and Fujitsu's latest generation Digital Annealer, i.e., Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The findings provide quantitative insights into the performance trade-offs, scalability, and practical viability of GQC versus AQC paradigms for PF analysis, highlighting the potential of quantum algorithms to address the computational challenges associated with modern electricity networks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ).</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation, entanglement, LQU and LQFI in $e^{+}e^{-} \to \text{Y}\bar{\text{Y}}$ processes at BESIII through noisy channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation, a protocol that has received extensive and intensive attention in quantum information processing, allows a quantum state to be transferred from one particle to another. In this study, we analytically investigate fidelity ($F$), logarithmic negativity (LN), local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) as a discord-like measure of quantum correlations in $e^{+}e^{-} \to \text{Y}\bar{\text{Y}}$ processes at BESIII through noisy channels, using experimental feasible parameters, where $\text{Y}$ and $\bar{\text{Y}}$ refer to the spin-$1/2$ hyperon and its antihyperon, respectively. Without a dephasing effect, we show that, LN, LQU, and LQFI vanish at $\varphi=\pm\pi$ and are symmetric around $\varphi=\pi/2$. We also explore the LN, LQU, and LQFI for different $\text{Y}\bar{\text{Y}}$ pairs subjected to three distinct types of decoherence channels. Specifically, we show that amplitude damping (AD) and phase damping (PD) lead to a decrease in LN, LQU, and LQFI with an increasing decoherence parameter $s$. In contrast, the phase flip (PF) channel exhibits symmetric behavior around $s=1/2$. Besides, we realize for teleportation, optimal fidelity for different hyperon-antihyperon pairs ($ \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi^{0}\bar{\Xi^{0}}$, $\Xi^{-}\bar{\Xi^{+}}$, $\Sigma^{+}\bar{\Sigma^{-}}$). We discuss the influence of noisy channels, specifically (AD, PF and PD), on the fidelity of quantum teleportation and on quantum correlations that can exist even beyond entanglement. Furthermore, the results show that the fidelity remains above the classical limit of $2/3$ in all three channels, even as the noise increases. This is a significant finding because it shows that not all quantum noise is detrimental. These results can have promising applications in quantum information and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Enhanced Adversarial Robustness with Rydberg Reservoir Learnin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) leverages the high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics inherent in quantum many-body systems for extracting spatiotemporal patterns in sequential and time-series data with minimal training overhead. Although QRC inherits the expressive capabilities associated with quantum encodings, recent studies indicate that quantum classifiers based on variational circuits remain susceptible to adversarial perturbations. In this perspective, we investigate the first systematic evaluation of adversarial robustness in a QRC based learning model. Our reservoir comprises an array of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms governed by a fixed Hamiltonian, which naturally evolves under complex quantum dynamics, producing high-dimensional embeddings. A lightweight multilayer perceptron serves as the trainable readout layer. We utilize the balanced datasets, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST, as a benchmark for rigorously evaluating the impact of augmenting the quantum reservoir with a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) in white-box adversarial attacks to assess its robustness. We demonstrate that this approach yields significantly higher accuracy than purely classical models across all perturbation strengths tested. This hybrid approach reveals a new source of quantum advantage and</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal diode with additional control by auxiliary atomic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum thermal diode, similar to an electronic diode, allows for unidirectional heat transmission. In this paper, we study a quantum thermal diode composed of two two-level atoms coupled to auxiliary two-level atoms. We find that the excited auxiliary atoms can weaken heat current and enhance the rectification effect, but the ground-state auxiliary atoms can enhance heat current and weaken the rectification effect. The more auxiliary atoms are coupled, the stronger the enhancing or weakening impact is. If the auxiliary atom is in a superposition state, we find that only the fraction that projects onto the excited state plays a significant role. In particular, if we properly design the coupling of the auxiliary atoms, the rectification effect can be eliminated. This provides the potential to control the heat current and the rectification performance by the states of the auxiliary atoms.</description>

      <title>Lattice surgery with Bell measurements: Modular fault-tolerant quantum computation at low entanglement cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers to fault tolerance. Small, low-noise quantum processors connected through relatively noisy quantum links are capable of fault-tolerant operation as long as the noise can be confined to the interface. Finding protocols that implement the quantum links between modules as efficiently as possible is essential because inter-module entanglement is challenging to produce at a similar rate and fidelity as local entanglement. We introduce a protocol for lattice surgery on surface codes in which all non-local operations are Bell measurements. The protocol simultaneously confines the link noise and requires only half as many module-crossing gates as previously proposed protocols. To mitigate distance-reducing hook errors, we introduce a strategy of alternating the gate sequence between rounds of syndrome measurement, which prevents multiple hooks from simultaneously aligning with a logical operator in the code. We evaluate our protocol's performance when two logical qubits on separate modules are prepared in a logical Bell state. Circuit-level simulations under depolarizing noise show that the logical error suppression for a given entanglement rate between modules is consistently stronger compared to the best-performing alternative protocols for a wide range of link noise, with a typical 40% entanglement resource saving for a constant logical error rate. Our approach to protocol design is applicable to any quantum circuit that must be divided across processor modules and can therefore guide development of resource-efficient modular quantum computation beyond the surface code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a state-specific orbital optimization scheme for improving the accuracy of excited states of the electronic structure Hamiltonian for the use on near-term quantum computers, which can be combined with any overlap-based excited-state quantum eigensolver. We derived the gradient of the overlap term between different states generated by different orbitals with respect to the orbital rotation matrix and use the gradient-based optimization methods to optimize the orbitals. This scheme allows for more flexibility in the choice of orbitals. We implement the state-specific orbital optimization scheme with the variational quantum deflation (VQD) algorithm, and show that it achieves higher accuracy than the state-averaged orbital optimization scheme on various molecules including H4 and LiH.</description>

Abstract: The supersymmetric structure of a generalized non-Hermitian driven two-level system is demonstrated. A unitary rotation turns the Hamiltonian into a more convenient form. After decoupling a set of differential equations, the supersymmetric structure of the problem can be unequivocally ap- appreciated. Performing a spectral analysis of an auxiliary stationary Schr\"odinger-like equation, complex time-dependent driving functions are obtained for which the corresponding (time-dependent) Schr\"odinger equation can be straightforwardly solved. Such complex drivings are seen to produce transitions in the qubit state in different, however interesting, manners. We believe that the results reported here will be of interest for designing and carrying out various experiments in laboratories specializing in nuclear magnetic resonance or in optics with gain and loss materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a key quantum algorithm for modeling complex systems. To implement a Hamiltonian simulation, it is typically decomposed into a list of Pauli strings, each corresponds to an RZ rotation gate with many Clifford gates. These RZ gates are generally synthesized into a sequence of Clifford and T gates in fault-tolerant quantum computers, where the T-gate count and T-gate depth are critical metrics for such systems. In this paper, we propose NCF, a compilation framework that reduces both the T-gate count and T-gate depth for Hamiltonian simulation. NCF partitions Pauli strings into groups, where each group can be conjugated (i.e., transformed) into a list of Pauli strings that apply quantum gates on a restricted subset of qubits, allowing for simultaneous synthesis of the whole group and reducing both T-gate count and depth. Experimental results demonstrate that NCF achieves an average reduction of 57.4%, 49.1%, and 49.0% in T-gate count, T-gate depth, and Clifford count, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>Emergent Discrete Time Crystals on Digital Quantum Computers: Boundary-Protected and Ancilla-Induced Disorder Mechanisms of Thermalization Slowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee edge singularity and quantum criticality in non-Hermitian PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for quantum criticality in the non-Hermitian detuned PXP model, and establish the complete phase diagram, which had remained elusive in previous studies. Starting from a numerically identified phase transition point, we construct an exact second-order phase transition boundary through a similarity transformation in the real-energy regime. By introducing the biorthogonal entanglement entropy and biorthogonal Loschmidt echo, we demonstrate from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium perspectives that this transition belongs to the Ising universality class. Using the correlation function, we further distinguish between confined and deconfined phases within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric region. In the complex-energy regime, we identify both a full $\mathcal{PT}$ transition and a first-excited-state $\mathcal{PT}$ transition, respectively. Moreover, we identify the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity (YLES) using both the associated-biorthogonal and self-normal Loschmidt echoes, and extract the corresponding critical exponent, which agrees with the predictions of non-unitary conformal field theory. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme to observe the YLES in Rydberg atomic arrays, which offers a promising route to exploring non-Hermitian critical phenomena and singularities in future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Inverse designed Hamiltonians for perfect state transfer and remote entanglement generation, and applications in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian inverse engineering enables the design of protocols for specific quantum evolutions or target state preparation. Perfect state transfer (PST) and remote entanglement generation are notable examples, as they serve as key primitives in quantum information processing. However, Hamiltonians obtained through conventional methods often lack robustness against noise. Assisted by inverse engineering, we begin with a noise-resilient energy spectrum and construct a class of Hamiltonians, referred to as the dome model, that significantly improves the system's robustness against noise, as confirmed by numerical simulations. This model introduces a tunable parameter $m$ that modifies the energy-level spacing and gives rise to a well-structured Hamiltonian. It reduces to the conventional PST model at $m=0$ and simplifies to a SWAP model involving only two end qubits in the large-$m$ regime. To address the challenge of scalability, we propose a cascaded strategy that divides long-distance PST into multiple consecutive PST steps. Our work is particularly suited for demonstration on superconducting qubits with tunable couplers, which enable rapid and flexible Hamiltonian engineering, thereby advancing the experimental potential of robust and scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quality assessment of quantum teleportation through the distribution of fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a comprehensive statistical framework for assessing single-qubit quantum teleportation performance beyond the conventional average-fidelity benchmark. At first, we derive a closed-form expression for the full probability density function of actual teleportation fidelities and apply it to both classical measure-and-prepare schemes and standard quantum teleportation, considering two relevant noise models: Bell-diagonal resource states and local amplitude-damping channels. These results reveal that protocols with identical average fidelities can exhibit markedly different statistical behaviors, and that relying solely on average fidelity can mask inherent asymmetries introduced by local noise, potentially leading to spurious conclusions of symmetry. Secondly, we introduce a certification method based on prior importance functions (e.g., Beta distributions), which unifies moment-based criteria and threshold-based success probabilities into a single figure of merit. Applying this framework, we show that certifying high-fidelity teleportation requires increasingly stronger entanglement or non-locality, and we clarify that the so-called ``fighting noise with noise'' effect arises from the chosen prior importance function rather than representing a genuine advantage. Our approach thus provides versatile tools for tailored, application-specific teleportation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>What can we do in a symmetry-constrained perspective? The importance of the total charge's status in quantum reference frame frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical difference corresponds to a fundamental physical question: whether the global charge associated to the symmetry group is accessible to symmetry-constrained observers. In this context, we formulate a definition of a perspective in terms of operational capacities, or lack thereof. Turning to consequences of adopting either approach, we discuss how adopting the weak approach induces an ambiguity in the momenta included in each perspective and bars from defining reversible QRF transformations. We then review and analyze the existing arguments motivating each approach, and show how they bear upon the problem of charge accessibility. Finally, we introduce a simple operational scenario in which upholding two reasonable physical postulates leads to the conclusion that internal observers could measure the global charge by 1/ performing a relativized interference measurement and 2/ classically communicating.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <title>Quantumness near the Schwarzschild black hole based on W-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate certain quantumness in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole by utilizing the W state. We explore the influence of the Hawking effect on the l_1-norm of quantum coherence, the first-order coherence (FOC), the concurrence-fill (CF) and the global concurrence (GC) in Schwarzschild black hole, for systems with one, two and three physically accessible modes. We conclude that the Hawking effect of the black hole not only disrupts but also enhance the quantum entanglement, while destroying the quantum coherence for systems with three physically accessible modes. For systems with one or two physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect exerts a positive influence on quantum coherence and quantum entanglement. Moreover, we study the influence of both the Hawking effect and environmental noise (AD channels) on l_1-norm of quantum coherence, FOC, CF and GC. It is demonstrated that for systems with three physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect of the black hole disrupts quantum coherence but exerts a positive influence on quantum entanglement under the AD channels.</description>

      <title>Robust Superradiance and Spontaneous Spin Ordering in Disordered Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective emission of a disordered array of $N$ excited two-level atoms into a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. In the perfectly ordered case, where atoms are spaced by exact integer multiples of the wavelength, the system exhibits the characteristic superradiant burst with a peak emission rate scaling as $N^2$. Using large-scale semiclassical simulations, we find that this key signature of superradiance remains asymptotically robust under strong spatial and spectral disorder, but also exhibits subtle finite-size scaling toward this limit. To explain our observations, we provide an analytical variational estimate for the maximal decay rate, which tightly bounds the numerical results and reveals how disorder shapes the collective decay. Specifically, we find that even in the presence of strong disorder, the spins tend to self-organize spontaneously according to their locations, which overall optimizes constructive interference effects and explains the emergence of mirror-asymmetric correlations in superradiant decay. These findings resolve important open questions regarding the existence and nature of superradiance in strongly disordered arrays and offer valuable insights for understanding collective quantum optical phenomena in realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Readout in a 22 nm Node Integrated Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Reduced constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations using global interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum circuits built from arbitrary single-qubit operations combined with programmable all-to-all multiqubit entangling gates that are native to, among other systems, trapped-ion quantum computing platforms. We report a constant-cost of no more than 6 application of such Clifford entangling multiqubit gates to realize any sequence of Clifford operations of any length, without ancillae. Furthermore, we show that any sequence of CNOT gates of any length, can be replaced with 5 applications of such Clifford entangling multiqubit gates, without ancillae. We investigate the required qubit drive power that is associated with these implementations. Our work introduces a practical and computationally efficient algorithm to realize these compilations.</description>

      <title>Are Randomized Quantum Linear Systems Solvers Practical?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized quantum algorithms have been proposed in the context of quantum simulation and quantum linear algebra with the goal of constructing shallower circuits than methods based on block encodings. While the algorithmic complexities of such randomized schemes have been shown to be suboptimal, it has been speculated that they may offer benefits in the early fault-tolerant era where circuit depth comes at a premium. In this work, we investigate the end-to-end resource requirements for a randomized quantum linear systems solver to estimate scalar properties of the matrix inverse by combining sampling from a Fourier series with Hamiltonian simulation. We derive explicit bounds on all relevant algorithmic parameters that control the total error. We analyze two algorithmic kernels for Hamiltonian simulation: a second order product formula approximation and a method called random Taylor expansion (RTE).
  Finally, we provide numerical demonstrations that confirm the validity of our analytical results and question the actual practicality of the randomized Fourier series-based approach for linear systems problems as we show that the sampling complexity can grow exponentially. By providing explicit bounds, our work serves as a bridge between theoretical algorithmic proposals and efficient hardware implementations while also enabling fair comparisons to alternative algorithms that exhibit optimal asymptotic complexities at the cost of large resource overheads.</description>

      <title>Observation of area laws in an interacting quantum field simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information shared between parties quantifies their correlation. The encoding of correlations across space and time characterises the structure, history, and interactions of systems. One of the most fundamental properties that emerges from studies of information is the area law, which states that information shared between spatial subregions typically scales with the area of their boundary rather than their volume. In non-interacting, quantum many-body systems, where Gaussian statistics apply, the scaling of information measures is well understood. Within interacting systems, the readout of information measures is impeded by the complexity of state reconstruction. As such, no measurements beyond small quantum systems (e.g., composed of few, localised particles) have been made. Here, we fill this gap by experimentally demonstrating the area law of mutual information in an ultra-cold atom simulator of quantum fields with tuneable interaction strength. Our results detail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area, and separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we quantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an information-theoretic measure - relative entropy. Our presented approach is data-driven, model agnostic, and readily applicable to other platforms and observables, thus constituting a universal toolkit for probing information in high-dimensional quantum systems and its role in shaping quantum matter and spacetime.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian-based quantum feature extraction method that generates complex features via the dynamics of $k$-local many-body spins Hamiltonians, enhancing machine learning performance. Classical feature vectors are embedded into spin-glass Hamiltonians, where both single-variable contributions and higher-order correlations are represented through many-body interactions. By evolving the system under suitable quantum dynamics on IBM digital quantum processors with 156 qubits, the data are mapped into a higher-dimensional feature space via expectation values of low- and higher-order observables. This allows us to capture statistical dependencies that are difficult to access with standard classical methods. We assess the approach on high-dimensional, real-world datasets, including molecular toxicity classification and image recognition, and analyze feature importance to show that quantum-extracted features complement and, in many cases, surpass classical ones. The results suggest that combining quantum and classical feature extraction can provide consistent improvements across diverse machine learning tasks, indicating a reliable level of early quantum usefulness for near-term quantum devices in data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Vacuum tunneling of vortices in two-dimensional $^4$He superfluid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At low temperature T we expect vacuum tunneling processes to occur in superfluid $^{4}$ He films. We distinguish between extrinsic processes, in which single vortices nucleate by tunneling off boundaries in the system, and intrinsic processes, in which vortex/anti-vortex pairs nucleate far from boundaries. It is crucial to incorporate the varying effective mass of the vortex in tunneling calculations. The intrinsic processes are the superfluid analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent. We calculate the tunneling rate for these processes, and describe a means of testing the predictions using a specific vortex counting experiment.</description>

We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectrum of gapless topological phases: a case study with topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13045</link>

Abstract: Using bulk gapless topological superconductors in both 1d and 2d as free fermion model examples, we demonstrate the power of subsystem correlation spectrum (the spectrum of correlation matrix), or equivalently the entanglement spectrum for the case of free fermions, in characterizing the topology of the non-trivial ground state. For the systems considered, we show that signatures of the lowenergy spectrum, including both the edge modes and the bulk modes, appear in the correlation spectrum, albeit with different behaviors. This work generalizes the 2d Li-Haldane entanglement spectrum characterization of topological edge states to 2d topological systems with gapless bulk.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Self-Trapping and Dynamical Phase Transition in Momentum Space Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has significant applications in modern physics, including band structure engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics. In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a dynamical phase transition in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear types enforce no-cloning and no-deleting theorems in functional quantum programming. However, in imperative quantum programming, they have not gained widespread adoption. This work aims to develop a quantum type system that combines ergonomic linear typing with imperative semantics and maintains safety guarantees. All ideas presented here have been implemented in Quantinuum's Guppy programming language.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Nonlinear Optical Tomography: Unbiased Characterization of Off- and On-Chip Coupling Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty and coherence in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d&gt;5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information processing in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations show that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter in the high temperature regime, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and that the operation time increases linearly with system size, diverging in the thermodynamic limit. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Statistical Structure of Charge Disorder in Si/SiGe Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a few principal axes - i.e.there are significant correlations between many properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\deg}, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, making decisions or drawing conclusions about quantum systems based on observed data. Recently, quantum control techniques have been successfully applied to quantum hypothesis testing, enabling the reduction of error probabilities in the task of distinguishing magnetic fields in presence of environmental noise. In real-world physical systems, such control is prone to various channels of inaccuracies. Therefore improving the robustness of quantum control in the context of quantum hypothesis testing is crucial. In this work, we utilize optimal control methods to compare scenarios with and without accounting for the effects of signal frequency inaccuracies. For parallel dephasing and spontaneous emission, the optimal control inherently demonstrates a certain level of robustness, while in the case of transverse dephasing with an imperfect signal, it may result in a higher error probability compared to the uncontrolled scheme. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a robust control approach optimized for a range of signal noise, demonstrating superior robustness beyond the predefined tolerance window. On average, both the optimal control and robust control show improvements over the uncontrolled schemes for various dephasing or decay rates, with the robust control yielding the lowest error probability.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal games play a crucial role in quantum information theory and have numerous applications in certification and cryptographic protocols. Kalai et al. (STOC 2023) introduced a procedure to compile a nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive proof, using a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, and showed that their compilation method preserves the classical bound of the game. Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS 2023) then showed that the quantum bound is preserved for the specific case of the CHSH game. Extending the proof techniques of Natarajan and Zhang, we show that the compilation procedure of Kalai et al. preserves the quantum bound for two classes of games: XOR games and d-outcome CHSH games. We also establish that, for any pair of qubit measurements, there exists an XOR game such that its optimal winning probability serves as a self-test for that particular pair of measurements.</description>

Abstract: Large scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of quantum computers. Despite significant advancements in quantum hardware, scalability remains a challenge, with errors accumulating as more qubits and gates are added. To overcome this limitation, quantum error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum error correction codes has been demonstrated on superconducting quantum processors and neutral atom-based systems, there have been no experimental reports of error suppression using flag qubits on a quantum processor. IBM's quantum hardware features a non-topological coupling map, and past developments of quantum error correction codes on this platform have primarily explored the use of flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers. Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on the IBM quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: We consider multi-path routing of entanglement in quantum networks, where a pre-prepared multipartite entangled 2D cluster state serves as a resource to perform different tasks on demand. We show how to achieve parallel connections between multiple, freely chosen groups of parties by performing appropriate local measurements among diagonal paths, which preserves the entanglement structure of the remaining state. We demonstrate how to route multiple Bell-states along parallel lines via crossings, turns and fade-in/-outs, analogously to a data bus. The results apply to networks at any scale.</description>

      <title>Group Sparse Matrix Optimization for Efficient Quantum State Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding ways to transform a quantum state to another is fundamental to quantum information processing. In this paper, we apply the sparse matrix approach to the quantum state transformation problem. In particular, we present a new approach for searching for unitary matrices for quantum state transformation by directly optimizing the objective problem using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Moreover, we consider the use of group sparsity as an alternative sparsity choice in quantum state transformation problems. Our approach incorporates sparsity constraints into quantum state transformation by formulating it as a non-convex problem. It establishes a useful framework for efficiently handling complex quantum systems and achieving precise state transformations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</title>

Abstract: The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Structure for Amplitude-Mixing Error-Transparent Gates for Binomial Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic encodings of quantum information offer hardware-efficient, noise-biased approaches to quantum error correction relative to qubit register encodings. Implementations have focused in particular on error correction of stored, idle quantum information, whereas quantum algorithms are likely to desire high duty cycles of active control. Error-transparent operations are one way to preserve error rates during operations, but, to the best of our knowledge, only phase gates have so far been given an explicitly error-transparent formulation for binomial encodings. Here, we introduce the concept of 'parity nested' operations, and show how these operations can be designed to achieve continuous amplitude-mixing logical gates for binomial encodings that are fully error-transparent to the photon loss channel. For a binomial encoding that protects against l photon losses, the construction requires $\lfloor$l/2$\rfloor$ + 1 orders of generalized squeezing in the parity nested operation to fully preserve this protection. We further show that error-transparency to all the correctable photon jumps, but not the no-jump errors, can be achieved with just a single order of squeezing. Finally, we comment on possible approaches to experimental realization of this concept.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Transformation Matrices: A Block Decomposition Approach for Efficient Gate Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm designed to approximate quantum transformation matrix with a restricted number of gates by using the block decomposition technique. Addressing challenges posed by numerous gates in handling large qubit transformations, the algorithm provides a solution by optimizing gate usage while maintaining computational accuracy. Inspired by the Block Decompose algorithm, our approach processes transformation matrices in a block-wise manner, enabling users to specify the desired gate count for flexibility in resource allocation. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in approximating transformations with significantly fewer gates, enhancing quantum computing efficiency for complex calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit synthesis with SQiSW</title>

Abstract: The primary objective of quantum circuit synthesis is to efficiently and accurately realize specific quantum algorithms or operations utilizing a predefined set of quantum gates, while also optimizing the circuit size. It holds a pivotal position in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computation. Historically, most synthesis efforts have predominantly utilized CNOT or CZ gates as the 2-qubit gates. However, the SQiSW gate, also known as the square root of iSWAP gate, has garnered considerable attention due to its outstanding experimental performance with low error rates and high efficiency in 2-qubit gate synthesis. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the SQiSW gate in various synthesis problems by utilizing only the SQiSW gate along with arbitrary single-qubit gates, while optimizing the overall circuit size. For exact synthesis, the upper bound of SQiSW gates to synthesize arbitrary 3-qubit and $n$-qubit gates are 24 and $\frac{139}{192}4^n(1+o(1))$ respectively, which relies on the properties of SQiSW gate in Lie theory and Quantum Shannon Decomposition. We also introduce an exact synthesis scheme for Toffoli gate using only 8 SQiSW gates, which is grounded in numerical observation. More generally, with respect to numerical approximations, we provide a theoretical analysis of a pruning algorithm to reduce the size of the searching space in numerical experiment to $\frac{1}{12}+o(1)$ of previous size, helping us reach the result that 11 SQiSW gates are enough in arbitrary 3-qubit gates synthesis up to an acceptable numerical error.</description>

      <title>Classically Bound and Quantum Quasi-Bound States of an Electron on a Plane Adjacent to a Magnetic Monopole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three-dimensional space an electron moving in the field of a magnetic monopole has no bound states. In this paper we explore the physics when the electron is restricted to a two-dimensional plane adjacent to a magnetic monopole. We find bound states in the classical version of the problem and quasi-bound states in the quantum one, in addition to a continuum of scattering states. We calculate the lifetimes of the quasi-bound states using several complementary approximate methods, which agree well in the cases where the lifetimes are relatively short. The threshold monopole magnetic charge required to realise a single quasi-bound state is approximately $18Q_D$, where $Q_D$ is the magnetic charge of a Dirac monopole. We examine the feasibility of achieving this magnetic charge in currently available monopole analogues: spin ice, artificial spin ice, and magnetic needles.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources within Operator Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local-operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, {and bears witness to many-body chaos for local dynamics}. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. {In terms of a previous conjecture on the characteristic scaling of LOE, our results also mean that non-integrable spin chains cannot be simulated classically}. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>The counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule is sufficient to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current algorithms for large-scale industrial optimization problems typically face a trade-off: they either require exponential time to reach optimal solutions, or employ problem-specific heuristics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPLIT, a general-purpose quantum-inspired framework for decomposing large-scale quadratic programs into smaller subproblems, which are then solved in parallel. SPLIT accounts for cross-interactions between subproblems, which are usually neglected in other decomposition techniques. The SPLIT framework can integrate generic subproblem solvers, ranging from standard branch-and-bound methods to quantum optimization algorithms. We demonstrate its effectiveness through comparisons with commercial solvers on the MaxCut and Antenna Placement Problems, with up to 20,000 decision variables. Our results show that SPLIT is capable of providing drastic reductions in computational time, while delivering high-quality solutions. In these regards, the proposed method is particularly suited for near real-time applications that require a solution within a strict time frame, or when the problem size exceeds the hardware limitations of dedicated devices, such as current quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the time-dependence of N-level systems under the Rotating Wave Approximation and dipole selection rules. Such systems can be solved straightforwardly if the Hamiltonian can be transformed into a time-independent form. The conditions under which a unitary transformation can be used to render time-dependent Hamiltonians into a time-independent form, thereby making the solution, are examined. After case-by-case analysis of different four and five-level systems, we conclude that systems having only one odd or even parity level achieve time-independence. In contrast, the others must satisfy a condition of laser detuning to achieve time-independence.</description>

Abstract: Generating non-Gaussian states and converting them into traveling wavepackets is crucial yet challenging for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing. We present a hardware-efficient approach that simultaneously achieves both tasks by combining an engineered nonlinear dissipation with a linear transmission loss from a superconducting circuit to a waveguide. This combination of dissipative channels leverages low-order interactions to induce a high-order nonlinearity, enabling deterministic emission of a wide range of non-Gaussian, error-correctable states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states, GKP states, and pair-cat states. We identify experimental superconducting circuit platforms and realistic parameter regimes for our proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05848v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our clock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a bounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic spectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by a Hermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described by a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we show how the bound on the minimum time quantum can be reduced and identify the conditions under which the clock values can be treated as continuous. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time observable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a relativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.</description>

We compare the complexities of these methods to their classical counterparts, finding that diagonalization via the quantum Fourier transform offers a quantum computational advantage for solving linear partial differential equations at a fixed final time. We employ a multidimensional amplitude estimation process to extract the full probability distribution from the quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that incorporates the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a soft constraint via a loss function penalty into the ML procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of High-Fidelity Logical Magic States from Code Switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states has remained as a necessary but daunting step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach is to fault-tolerantly prepare a magic state in one code and then switch to another, a method known as code switching. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol on an ion-trap quantum processor, yielding a logical magic state encoded in an error-correcting code with state-of-the-art logical fidelity. Our experiment is based on the first demonstration of code switching between color codes, from the fifteen-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code to the seven-qubit Steane code. We prepare an encoded magic state in the Steane code with $82.58\%$ probability, with an infidelity of at most $5.1(2.7) \times 10^{-4}$. The reported infidelity is lower than the leading infidelity of the physical operations utilized in the protocol by a factor of at least $2.7$, indicating the quantum processor is below the pseudo-threshold. Furthermore, we create two copies of the magic state in the same quantum processor and perform a logical Bell basis measurement for a sample-efficient certification of the encoded magic state. The high-fidelity magic state can be combined with the already-demonstrated fault-tolerant Clifford gates, state preparation, and measurement of the 2D color code, completing a universal set of fault-tolerant computational primitives with logical error rates equal or better than the physical two-qubit error rate.</description>

      <title>Density matrix analysis of systems influenced by periodic Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider simple systems that are influenced by Hamiltonians with time periodicity. Our analysis is mainly focussed on the density matrix approach and aims to solve the Liouville equation of motion from which one can extract the state of the system when the system is in a pure state. We start our analysis with the standard Rabi-oscillation problem. We consider a density matrix corresponding to the entire model system and solve the Liouville equation of motion. We have then made use of the Lewis-Reisenfeld invariant approach and arrive at the exact same result which implies that the density matrix of the system can indeed be identified with the Lewis invariant. Finally, we consider a two-level system with a constant magnetic field in the $z$-direction and a time dependent magnetic field in the $x$-direction. Finally, we solve the Liouville equation of motion for this system and calculate the various coherence measures and plot them to investigate the time dependence and reliability of different coherence measures.</description>

      <title>Bounding the asymptotic quantum value of all multipartite compiled non-local games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games, quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond to quantum commuting strategies.
  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations-such as the Toffoli gate-remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in direct decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. We have also applied the JK algorithm to other multi-qubit gates and algorithm. For the Fredkin gate, it reduces the number of time steps from 200 to 104 and the number of exchange unitaries from 276 to 172. For the quantum Fourier transform, it compresses the sequence from 180 to 80 time steps and from 237 to 202 exchange unitaries. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

      <title>Composable logical gate error in approximate quantum error correction: reexamining gate implementations in Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the accuracy of logical gates is paramount in approximate error correction, where perfect implementations are often unachievable with the available set of physical operations. To this end, we introduce a single scalar quantity we call the (composable) logical gate error. It captures both the deviation of the logical action from the desired target gate as well as leakage out of the code space. It is subadditive under successive application of gates, providing a simple means for analyzing circuits. We show how to bound the composable logical gate error in terms of matrix elements of physical unitaries between (approximate) logical computational basis states. In the continuous-variable context, this sidesteps the need for computing energy-bounded norms.
  As an example, we study the composable logical gate error for linear optics implementations of Paulis and Cliffords in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We find that the logical gate error for implementations of Paulis depends linearly on the squeezing parameter. This implies that their accuracy improves monotonically with the amount of squeezing. For some Cliffords, however, linear optics implementations which are exact for ideal GKP codes fail in the approximate case: they have a constant logical gate error even in the limit of infinite squeezing. This is consistent with previous results about the limitations of certain gate implementations for approximate GKP codes. It shows that findings applicable to ideal GKP codes do not always translate to the realm of physically realizable approximate GKP codes.</description>

      <title>Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</description>

      <title>Software Framework for Optically Accessible Quantum Memory Using Group-IV Color Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis. Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency and long-distance quantum memory-assisted device-independent quantum secret sharing with single photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a critical role in building the distributed quantum networks. Device-independent (DI) QSS provides the highest security level for QSS. However, the photon transmission loss and extremely low multipartite entanglement generation rate largely limit DI QSS's secure photon transmission distance (less than 1 km) and practical key generation efficiency. To address the above drawbacks, we propose the quantum memory-assisted (QMA) DI QSS protocol based on single photon sources (SPSs). The single photons from the SPSs are used to construct long-distance multipartite entanglement channels with the help of the heralded architecture. The heralded architecture enables our protocol to have an infinite secure photon transmission distance in theory. The QMA technology can not only increase the multi-photon synchronization efficiency, but also optimize the photon transmittance to maximize the construction efficiency of the multipartite entanglement channels. Our protocol achieves the practical key generation efficiency seven orders of magnitude higher than that of the existing DI QSS protocols based on cascaded spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and six orders of magnitude higher than that of the DI QSS based on SPSs without QMA. Our protocol has modular characteristics and is feasible under the current experimental technical conditions. Combining with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, the requirement on experimental devices can be effectively reduced. Our protocol is expected to promote the development of long-distance and high-efficiency DI quantum network in the future.</description>

Abstract: Photons are central to quantum technologies, with photonic qubits offering a promising platform for quantum communication. Semiconductor quantum dots stand out for their ability to generate single photons on demand, a key capability for enabling long-distance quantum networks. In this work, we utilize high-purity single-photon sources based on self-assembled InAs(Ga)As quantum dots as quantum information carriers. We demonstrate that such on-demand single photons can generate quantum contextuality. This capability enables a novel protocol for semi-device-independent quantum key distribution over free-space channels. Crucially, our method does not require ideal or perfectly projective measurements, opening a new pathway for robust and practical quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox remains a profound challenge in theoretical physics. Among the proposed resolutions, the soft-hair approach stands out for its independence from any specific quantum gravity model. In this paper, we investigate how the inclusion of soft degrees of freedom in the unitary evolution of quantum electrodynamics, within a spacetime collapsing into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, leads to information scrambling. By evaluating the tripartite mutual information of this unitary evolution, we estimate the degree of information scrambling in the corresponding quantum channel. Our results show that the presence of soft degrees of freedom induces scrambling of information initially encoded in hard degrees of freedom, driven by quantum electrodynamics interactions and the nontrivial transformations arising from the non-uniqueness of the vacuum in the collapsing spacetime. This lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the black hole information paradox, particularly the mechanisms behind information scrambling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T remains a technical challenge due to field inhomogeneity and prolonged T1 values. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate and clinically applicable myocardial T1 mapping technique for 5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and validate its performance in a multicenter study. Methods: The proposed method is based on a 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence, dubbed combined-correction MOLLI (coMOLLI), which corrects for both inversion efficiency and readout-induced signal disturbances. Specifically, coMOLLI employs a gradient recalled echo (GRE) readout rather than the commonly used bSSFP readout. Its signal evolution is modeled to estimate T1 values, which incorporates both inversion efficiency and readout disturbances to improve fitting accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, the inversion pulse was redesigned under hardware constraints and the observed B0 and B1 variations over the heart at 5T, using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. The method was validated in phantom experiments, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients. Results: The optimized inversion pulse at 5T is the Tan/Tanh pulse with A = 10 kHz, K_s = 4, k = 22, and T_p = 8 ms. In phantom studies, coMOLLI showed high accuracy versus reference IR-FSE, yielding relative errors within 5% for all nine vials. In vivo studies, the average native myocardial T1 values across 21 healthy volunteers were 1468 +/- 48 ms, 1514 +/- 39 ms, and 1545 +/- 50 ms, and blood T1 values were 2182 +/- 132 ms, 2124 +/- 153 ms, and 2131 +/- 158 ms for apical, middle, and base slices, respectively. Conclusion: The coMOLLI method demonstrated high accuracy in phantom studies and feasibility in vivo studies. By adopting the widely used 5-(3)-3 MOLLI acquisition scheme, it shows potential for clinical cardiac imaging at 5T.</description>

      <title>Scattering resonances and pairing in a Rabi-coupled Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using a Rabi drive to tune the interactions in an atomic Fermi gas. Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.</description>

      <title>A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless fermions living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Landau level spectroscopy of Dirac fermions in millimeter-scale twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</description>

      <title>Detecting screens modeled by Schr\"odinger operators that generate $C_0$ contraction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function $\psi$ in a bounded $C^2$ region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assume the detection process is irreversible, its mechanism is time independent and also hard, i.e., detections occur only along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Under these conditions Tumulka informally argued that the dynamics of $\psi$ must be governed by a $C_0$ contraction semigroup that weakly solves the Schr\"odinger equation and proposed modeling the detector by a time-independent local absorbing boundary condition at $\partial \Omega$. In this paper, we apply the newly discovered theory of boundary quadruples to parameterize all $C_0$ contraction semigroups whose generators extend the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian, and prove a variant of Tumulka's claim: all such evolutions are generated by the placement of a linear absorbing boundary condition on $\psi$ along $\partial \Omega$. We combine this result with the work of Werner to show that each $C_0$ contraction semigroup naturally admits a Born rule for the time of detection along $\partial \Omega$, and we prove that a detection will almost surely occur in finite time if detectors have been placed everywhere along $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Generation of Currents by Nonreciprocal Local and Global Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling between the environment and the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for the two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a narrow region of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</description>

      <title>Defect-driven incoherent skin localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>
