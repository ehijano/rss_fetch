      <title>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.</description>

      <title>Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Thermal states emerging from low-entanglement background in disordered spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum systems is governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, while strong disorder can induce its breakdown via many-body localization. Here we show that disorder can also generate a narrow band of thermal eigenstates embedded in an otherwise non-thermal spectrum. We illustrate this generic mechanism using paradigmatic spin-1 models, including Heisenberg, XY, and Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with several types of disorder. By analyzing their level statistics, entanglement properties and quench dynamics, we show that the disorder-induced states are genuinely thermal and we trace their origin to the null space of the disorder term in the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that disorder can give rise to an unexpected coexistence of thermal and non-thermal dynamics within the same many-body spectrum.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Limits of QAOA Parameter Transfer at High-Rounds on Sparse Ising Models With Geometrically Local Cubic Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>50 years of spin glass theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975, two papers were published that together sparked major new directions, conceptual, mathematical and practically applicable, in several previously disparate fields of science. In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments. These papers were `Theory of spin glasses' by S.F.Edwards and P.W.Anderson (EA)[1] and `Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass', by D.Sherrington and S.Kirkpatrick (SK)[2], both concerned with trying to understand recent experiments that suggested a new phase of matter.</description>
