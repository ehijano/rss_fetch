      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>
