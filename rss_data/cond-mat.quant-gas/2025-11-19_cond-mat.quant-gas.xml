      <title>Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of entanglement asymmetry for space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We feature out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and tripling phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. As for the in-vacuum case, the three-body clustering is always the lowest-lying phase. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Stability of current-carrying states in hard-core bosons with long-range hopping on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of current-carrying states with quasi-momentum $K$ in the Bose-condensed phase of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice, where particles transfer between two sites separated by distance $r$ with hopping amplitude decaying algebraically with $r$ as $\propto r^{-\alpha}$. Using a mean-field theory, we analyze the excitation spectrum and determine the critical quasi-momenta associated with Landau and dynamical instabilities. We find that the long-range hopping suppresses the critical quasi-momenta and makes them vanish at $\alpha=3$. Near $\alpha=3$, we show that the critical quasi-momentum $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the dynamical instability exhibits the scaling behavior $K_\mathrm{c} \propto \Delta^{1+\Delta}$ with $\Delta=\alpha-3$, where the scaling exponent explicitly depends on $\Delta$, as a consequence of the long-range nature of the hopping.</description>

      <title>Observation of critical scaling in the Bose gas universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical exponents characterize the divergent scaling of thermodynamic quantities near phase transitions and allow for the classification of physical systems into universality classes. While quantum gases thermalizing by interparticle interactions fall into the XY model universality class, the ideal Bose gas has been predicted to form a distinct universality class whose signatures have not yet been revealed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity. By measuring the spatial correlations near the condensation transition, we determine the critical exponent for the correlation length to be $\nu = 0.52(3)$. Our results constitute a first experimental test of the long-standing scaling predictions for the Bose gas universality class.</description>

      <title>Realizing Unitary $k$-designs with a Single Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.</description>

      <title>Magnetic atoms with a large electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally show that an electric dipole moment of more than 1 Debye can be induced in the dysprosium (Dy) atom, in a long-lived state that is about 17513 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state. This metastable state is part of a strongly coupled opposite-parity doublet. Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition. The three-state Stark interaction enables preparation of Dy atoms in the metastable state via single-photon excitation from the ground state.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Low-Temperature Heat Capacity in Cryocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-temperature isochoric heat capacity of cryocrystals was scaled using the universal scaling function. This universality links the magnitude of the anomaly and the characteristic temperature of the hump $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ in heat capacity, which is related to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. For atomic, molecular, and quantum cryocrystals, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ systematically shifts with molar volume, reflecting Brillouin zone scaling and revealing a common vibrational origin. These findings for the scaling function bridge thermodynamics with the vibrational density of states, highlighting fundamental universality in lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate the generation of dispersive shock waves, which arise naturally in physical settings such as optical waveguide arrays and superfluids confined within optical lattices. The underlying physically relevant model is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We consider the evolution of piecewise smooth initial data composed of two distinct nonlinear periodic eigenmodes. To begin interpreting the resulting wave dynamics, we employ the tight-binding approximation, reducing the continuous system to a discrete NLS (DNLS) model with piecewise constant initial data (i.e., a Riemann problem), where each constant state represents a discrete Floquet-Bloch mode at the continuum model level. The resulting tight-binding approximation is shown to display higher-fidelity for {deeper} periodic potentials. This reduced DNLS model effectively models the dynamics at the minima of the periodic potential of the original continuum NLS. Within such a single-band DNLS framework, we apply tools from Whitham modulation theory and long-wave quasi-continuum reductions to uncover and analyze a rich spectrum of non-convex, discrete dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena, comparing the resulting phenomenology with that of the periodic-potential-bearing continuum model.</description>

      <title>Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, called the Shapiro steps, forms today's voltage standard! Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. We find that the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and nucleation of solitonic excitations, whose dynamics we follow in space and time. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and may enable metrological and fundamental advances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intertwining of multiple order parameters is a widespread phenomenon in equilibrium condensed matter systems, yet its exploration is often hindered by the complexity of real materials. Here, we present a controlled study of intertwined orders in a minimal and versatile driven-dissipative quantum-engineered platform. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate at the intersection of two optical cavities, realizing two competing copies of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking superradiant phase transition characterized by density wave orders. Using periodic drives that exploit dynamical symmetry reduction, we show that collective excitations can be harnessed to stabilize a variety of novel intertwined orders. Going beyond the conventional phenomenology involving Landau orders, we show the emergence of a larger class of out-of-equilibrium intertwined phases, including intertwining of purely time-crystalline orders, as well as between Landau and time crystal orders. These results should be observable in state of the art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>
