      <title>How Massive Star Clusters Form and Evolve: A Near-IR Survey of the W51 Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric observations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize its young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster members and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources, out of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The average extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in W51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in the region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter. Despite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and estimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses for W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range of 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters assuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both proto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater than or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Simulations of Coronal Mass Ejections in Interplanetary Space with Elliptical Cone Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of CME arrival time strongly depends on the CME propagation models in interplanetary space and the geometrical aspects of the CME model. We conducted ensemble simulations of CMEs propagation with various elliptical cone shapes to study the relation between the CME speed and the optimum cone shape. We numerically searched for the best elliptical aspect ratio of the elliptical cone for each CME in our CME-ICME pair data. We found that the fast CMEs tend to have a higher elliptical aspect ratio (more circular) than the slower CMEs (flattened). Our results suggest that a fast CME gives a stronger push to all directions, which results in a more circular shape of the leading-edge. We believe that this velocity-dependent behavior is related to the different Lorentz force strengths during the early expansion of a CME.</description>

      <title>Exploring Mixing Thresholds in Asteroseismic Stellar Evolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferences from observations clearly show that mixing in stars extends beyond the convective boundaries defined by mixing length theory. This triggered the proposal of a variety of prescriptions to include additional mixing in stellar models. These prescriptions typically introduce free parameters to set the extent of the additional mixing and may also introduce numerical parameters. In the case of exponential overshooting, one must decide the threshold at which the exponential decay of the mixing coefficient can be treated as zero. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, I explore the effect of varying this parameter on asteroseismic models of main-sequence stars with growing convective cores. From this, I conclude that overshoot_D_min should be set to $10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s or lower for these stars. The default value in MESA is four orders of magnitude higher than this recommendation, which results in discontinuous evolution.</description>

      <title>T CrB: overview of the accretion history, Roche-lobe filling, orbital solution, and radiative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) We aim to derive a robust estimate of the most important parameters describing the physical nature of T CrB, trace the accretion history onto its white dwarf, and account for the unexpected delay in the occurrence of the new outburst: the SAP prior to 1946 was brighter, and it was followed by the nova eruption within 6 months from its conclusion. This time the 2015-2023 SAP has been fainter and two years past its conclusion no new eruption has yet taken place. During 2005-2025, a period covering SAP and the preceding quiescence, we collected a massive amount of photometric and spectroscopic observations that we have analyzed together with Swift UVOT data. Guided by the results of the orbital solution and in particular by the radiative modeling to which we subjected the whole set of available data, we found for T CrB a binary period of 227.5528 days, an inclination of 61 deg, and masses of 1.35 Msun and 0.93 Msun for the white dwarf and the M3III companion, respectively, making mass transfer dynamically stable. The red giant fills completely its Roche lobe, and at Vrot sin(i)=4.75 +-0.26 km/s it is rotating much slower that the 16 km/s co-rotation value. The ~20 deg azimuth of the hot spot, implied by the hump shaping the optical light curve in quiescence, fixes the outer radius of the disk to 58 Rsun, the same as the canonical value expected from disk theory. In quiescence the disk is cold and mostly neutral. SAP has been caused by an inside-out collapse of the disk, during which the mean accretion rate onto the WD has been ~28x larger than in quiescence. SAP ended in April 2023, but from May 2024 mass-flow has intensively resumed at disk inner radii while the collapse wave reached the outer portions of the disk; the consequent revamp in mass accretion could fill the gap inherited by the fainter 2015-2023 SAP and eventually lead the WD accreted shell to ignition.</description>

      <title>Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>J1250+0455AB an ultracool binary in a hierarchical triple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the ultracool dwarf binary system J1250+0455AB, a low-mass (M$_\odot$$_\mathrm{tot} &lt;$ 0.2 M$_\odot$) system in which the components straddle the M/L dwarf boundary. The binary was resolved through near-infrared adaptive optics imaging with LUCI1-SOUL on the Large Binocular Telescope, revealing a projected angular separation of 0.17 $\pm$ 0.015$\arcsec$, which, combined with a system distance of $71 \pm 5.8$\,pc, corresponds to a physical separation of 12.2 $\pm$ 1.5\,AU at a position angle of 84.8 $\pm$ 0.2{\deg}. We estimated the orbital period of J1250+0455AB to be 156 $\pm$ 8\,yr, the bolometric luminosities of the primary and secondary luminosities as $\log (L_\mathrm{bol} / L_\odot) = -3.45 \pm 0.04$ and $-3.58 \pm 0.04$, respectively, with the spectral types of M9 and L0 determined through binary template fitting and spectrophotometric relations. This binary system is part of a hierarchical triple with a separation of 10.44$\arcsec$ from its primary. We estimated the age of the system from the rotational period of the primary star as $0.56^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ Gyr. Using evolutionary models, for each component we estimate the mass [0.079 $\pm$ 0.002\,M$_\odot$ / 0.072 $\pm$ 0.003\,M$_\odot$], effective temperature [2350 $\pm$ 38\,K / 2200 $\pm$ 43\,K], and radius [0.113 $\pm$ 0.003\,R$_\odot$ / 0.108 $\pm$ 0.002\,R$_\odot$]. Based on the system's binding energy, total mass, and separation, J1250+0455AB is predicted to be a highly stable system, remaining bound for $&gt;$ 10\,Gyr. J1250+0455AB extends the growing population of UCD benchmark systems, providing a new system for refining evolutionary theories at the lowest stellar masses into the substellar regime.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.</description>

      <title>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</description>

      <title>Matching seismic masses for RR Lyrae-type and oscillating red horizontal-branch stars in M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters offer a powerful way to test the properties of stellar populations and the late stages of low-mass stellar evolution. In this paper we study oscillating giant stars and overtone RR Lyrae-type pulsators in the nearest globular cluster, M4, with the help of high-precision, continuous light curves collected by the Kepler space telescope in the K2 mission. We determine the frequency composition of five RRc stars and model their physical parameters from linear pulsation models. We are able, for the first time, to compare seismic masses of RR Lyrae stars directly to the masses of the very similar red horizontal branch stars in the same stellar population, independently determined from asteroseismic scaling relations. We find average seismic masses of $0.648\pm0.028\,M_\odot$ for RR Lyrae stars and $0.657\pm0.034\,M_\odot$ for red horizontal-branch stars. While the accuracy of our RR Lyrae masses still relies on the accuracy of evolutionary mass differences of neighboring horizontal branch subgroups, this result strongly indicates that RRc stars may indeed exhibit high-degree, $\ell = 8$ and 9 non-radial modes, and modeling these modes can provide realistic mass estimates. We compare the seismic masses of our red horizontal branch and RR Lyrae stars to evolutionary models and to theoretical mass relations and highlight the limitations of these relations.</description>

      <title>FIP Bias Evolution in an Emerging Active Region as observed in SPICE Synoptic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of relative elemental abundances in the context of the first ionization potential effect focusing on an active region. Our aim is to characterize this evolution in different types of solar active region structures as well as in different atmospheric layers. We wish to assert how the measured changes relate to different magnetic topologies by computing abundance enhancement in different conditions using the ponderomotive force model.
  Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range--from the upper chromosphere to the low corona--and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model.
  We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfv\'en-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.</description>

      <title>Light Echoes of Time-resolved Flares and Application to Kepler Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light echoes of stellar flares provide an intriguing option for exploring protoplanetary disks in young stellar systems. Previous work on light echoes of circumstellar disks made use of delta-function flares for modeling. We present a new model that incorporates echoes produced by extended, time-resolved flares. We then test this model on known disk-bearing stars with Kepler K2 data by estimating disk parameters from possible echo signals. We focus on two stars; the first appears to be a good candidate for use of this echo model, which predicts disk parameters that are consistent with known values. The second star turns out to be more problematic as a result of high brightness variability in its post-peak lightcurve. These two cases show both the promise and limitations of light echoes as a tool for exploring protoplanetary disks in the time domain</description>

      <title>Early Post Asymptotic Giant Branch Instability: Does it Affect White Dwarf Hydrogen Envelope Mass?</title>

Abstract: Although most white dwarf stars have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, a significant fraction have atmospheres in which hydrogen is spectroscopically absent, with the fraction of hydrogen-free atmospheres varying with effective temperature. Estimates of the total mass of hydrogen, MH, in the stellar envelope from either asteroseismology or spectral evolution are at odds with predicted values from theoretical stellar evolution modeling. Recent work has found that models in the early post Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase of evolution can exhibit thermally and dynamical unstable behavior. Here we investigate whether this Early Post AGB Instability (EPAGBI) can help resolve the conflict in MH values determined from white dwarf spectral evolution, analysis of DAV pulsations and canonical stellar evolution modeling, by evolving models of mass 1 and 2Msun through the AGB phases and to the white dwarf cooling track. The MH values at the end of the calculations are in the range consistent with asteroseismic determinations. The major impact of EPAGBIs is that they cause loops in the HRD, which are absent when the EPAGBI is suppressed. Such loops might be detectable in a long-term monitoring program, or by their imprint on planetary nebula morphology imparted by the cyclically varying mass loss rate. Since the characteristic timescale of the looping in the HRD depends on the stellar mass, it could provide a way to determine the stellar mass just after AGB departure. Another EPAGBI signature is the production of Li by the Cameron-Fowler process. During the EPAGBI phase the photospheric temperature is always too high for the Li I resonance line to be detected. However, 7Be is convected to the photosphere in significant amounts (up to 400 times the solar photospheric mass fraction) at various times in the EPAGBI phase, which may be detectable by observing the Be II resonance doublet.</description>

      <title>SARD: A YOLOv8-Based System for Solar Active Region Detection with SDO/HMI Magnetograms</title>

Abstract: Solar active regions are where sunspots are located and photospheric magnetic fluxes are concentrated, therefore being the sources of energetic eruptions in the solar atmosphere. The detection and statistics of solar active regions have been forefront topics in solar physics. In this study, we developed a solar active region detector (SARD) based on the advanced object detection model YOLOv8. First, we applied image processing techniques including thresholding and morphological operations to 6975 line-of-sight magnetograms from 2010 to 2019 at a cadence of 12~h, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. With manual refinement, we labeled 26531 active regions in the dataset for further training and test with the detection model. Without any overlap between the training and test sets, the superior performance of SARD is demonstrated by an average precision rate as high as 94\%. We then performed a statistical analysis on the area and magnetic flux of the detected active regions, both of which yield log-normal distributions. This result sheds light on the underlying complexity and multi-scale nature of solar active regions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: Detection of a sub-Neptune in a 6-day period orbit around the M dwarf Gl 410</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03572</link>

Abstract: The search for exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs represents a crucial milestone in the census of planetary systems in the vicinity of our Solar System. Since 2018 our team is carrying a radial-velocity blind search program for planets around nearby M dwarfs with the near-IR spectro-polarimeter and velocimeter SPIRou at the CFHT and the optical velocimeter SOPHIE at the OHP in France. Here we present our results on Gl 410, a 0.55 Msun 480+-150 Myr old active M dwarf distant 12 pc. We used the line-by-line (LBL) technique to measure the RVs with SPIRou and the template matching method with SOPHIE. Three different methods were employed, two based on principal component analysis (PCA), to clean the SPIRou RVs for systematics. We applied Gaussian processes (GP) modeling to correct the SOPHIE RVs for stellar activity. The l1 and apodize sine periodogram analysis was used to search for planetary signals in the SPIRou data taking into account activity indicators. We analyzed TESS data and searched for planetary transits. We report the detection of a M sin(i)=8.4+-1.3 Mearth sub-Neptune planet at a period of 6.020+-0.004 days in circular orbit with SPIRou. The same signal, although with lower significance, was also retrieved in the SOPHIE RV data after correction for activity using a GP trained on SPIRou's longitudinal magnetic field (Bl) measurements. The TESS data indicate that the planet is not transiting. Within the SPIRou wPCA RVs, we find tentative evidence for two additional planetary signals at 2.99 and 18.7 days. In conclusion, infrared RVs are a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets around active M dwarfs. Care should be taken however to correct/filter systematics generated by residuals of the telluric correction or small structures in the detector plane. The LBL technique combined with PCA offers a promising way to reach this objective. Further monitoring of Gl 410 is necessary.</description>
