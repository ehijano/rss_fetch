      <title>Universal Critical Holography and Domain Wall Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using holography, we study the universal scaling laws governing the coarsening dynamics of strongly coupled domain walls. Specifically, we studied the universal dependence of the length of the domain wall interfaces on the quench rate. The relation satisfies the Kibble-Zurek scaling shortly after the critical point. However, as time goes by, the coarsening dynamics suppresses the Kibble-Zurek scaling in favor of a universal dynamical scaling of the characteristic length and the adiabatic growth of the system. Theoretical predictions of the universal scaling laws are consistent with numerical findings in both regimes for both weak and strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation rates from experimental uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental uncertainty prompted the early development of the quantum uncertainty relations
  nowknownasspeedlimits. However, it has not yet been a part of the development of thermodynamic
  speed limits on dissipation. Here, we predict the maximal rates of heat and entropy production using
  experimentally accessible uncertainties in a thermodynamic speed limit. Because these rates can be
  difficult to measure directly, we reparametrize the speed limit to predict these observables indirectly
  from quantities that are readily measurable with experiments. From this transformed speed limit,
  we identify the resolution an experiment will need to upper bound nonequilibrium rates. Without
  models for the dynamics, these speed limit predictions agree with calorimetric measurements of
  the energy dissipated by a pulled Brownian particle and a microtubule active gel, validating the
  approach and suggesting potential for the design of experiments.</description>

      <title>High-precision simulation of finite-size thermalizing systems at long times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To simulate thermalizing systems at long times, the most straightforward approach is to calculate the thermal properties at the corresponding energy. In a quantum many-body system of size $N$, for local observables and many initial states, this approach has an error of $O(1/N)$, which is reminiscent of the finite-size error of the equivalence of ensembles. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient numerical method so that the simulation error is of higher order in $1/N$. This finite-size error scaling is proved by assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Survival probability, particle imbalance, and their relationship in quadratic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>

      <title>Weighted average temperature as the effective temperature of a system in contact with two thermal baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective temperature of a harmonic chain whose two ends are coupled to two baths at different temperatures. We propose to take the weighted average temperature as the effective temperature of the system. The weight factors are related to the couplings between the system and two baths as well as the asymmetry of interactions between oscillators. We revisit the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states based on the weighted average temperature. It is found that the fundamental thermodynamic relations in nonequilibrium steady states possess similar concise forms as those in equilibrium thermodynamics, provided that we replace the temperature in equilibrium with the weighted average temperature in steady states. We also illustrate the procedure to calculate the effective temperatures via four examples.</description>

      <title>Hamonically trapped inertial run-and-tumble particle in one-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state of a one-dimensional inertial run-and-tumble particle (IRTP) trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the presence of inertia leads to two distinct dynamical scenarios, namely, overdamped and underdamped, characterized by the relative strength of the viscous and the trap time-scales. We also find that inertial nature of the active dynamics leads to the particle being confined in specific regions of the phase plane in the overdamped and underdamped cases, which we compute analytically. Moreover, the interplay of the inertial and active time-scales gives rise to several sub-regimes, which are characterized by very different behaviour of position and velocity fluctuations of the IRTP. In particular, in the underdamped regime, both the position and velocity undergoes transitions from a novel multi-peaked structure in the strongly active limit to a single peaked Gaussian-like distribution in the passive limit. On the other hand, in the overdamped scenario, the position distribution shows a transition from a U-shape to a dome-shape, as activity is decreased. Interestingly, the velocity distribution in the overdamped scenario shows two transitions -- from a single-peaked shape with an algebraic divergence at the origin in the strongly active regime to a double peaked one in the moderately active regime to a dome-shaped one in the passive regime.</description>

      <title>Power-law correlation in the homogeneous disordered state of anisotropically self-propelled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles display unique collective phenomena, due to the intrinsic coupling of density and polarity. For instance, the giant number fluctuation appears in the orientationally ordered state, and the motility-induced phase separation appears in systems with repulsion. Effects of strong noise typically lead to a homogeneous disordered state, in which the coupling of density and polarity can still play a significant role. Here, we study universal properties of the homogeneous disordered state in two-dimensional systems with uniaxially anisotropic self-propulsion. Using hydrodynamic arguments, we propose that the density correlation and polarity correlation generically exhibit power-law decay with distinct exponents (-2 and -4, respectively) through the coupling of density and polarity. Simulations of self-propelled lattice gas models indeed show the predicted power-law correlations, regardless of whether the interaction type is repulsion or alignment. Further, by mapping the model to a two-component boson system and employing non-Hermitian perturbation theory, we obtain the analytical expression for the structure factors, the Fourier transform of the correlation functions. This reveals that even the first order of the interaction strength induces the power-law correlations.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entanglement entropy of spin chain with Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method to estimate R\'enyi entanglement entropy of a spin system, which is based on the replica trick and generative neural networks with explicit probability estimation. It can be extended to any spin system or lattice field theory. We demonstrate our method on a one-dimensional quantum Ising spin chain. As the generative model, we use a hierarchy of autoregressive networks, allowing us to simulate up to 32 spins. We calculate the second R\'enyi entropy and its derivative and cross-check our results with the numerical evaluation of entropy and results available in the literature.</description>

      <title>QSSEP describes the fluctuations of quantum coherences in the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the transfer matrix method, we numerically investigate the structure of spatial coherences and their fluctuations in the 3d Anderson model in the metallic phase when driven out-of-equilibrium by external leads at zero temperature and in linear response. We find that the stationary state entails non-local non-Gaussian correlations in the longitudinal direction, which are characteristic of diffusive non equilibrium steady states. These correlations are quantitatively matched, at least up to third order, by those analytically derived in the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) which describes diffusive fermions in 1d subject to dynamical disorder. Furthermore, the large deviation scaling and $U(1)$ invariance of these correlations imply a link between the Anderson model and free probability theory. Our findings suggest the existence of a universal structure of correlations in non-interacting diffusive quantum systems that might be captured by QSSEP.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and hyperuniformity in quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models with and without disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of boson density and bosonic condensate. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a divergence of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an aggregation process that begins with equal concentrations of positively and negatively `charged' monomers. Oppositely charged monomers merge to form neutral dimers. These dimers are the seeds for subsequent aggregation events in which neutral clusters of necessarily even mass join irreversibly to form neutral aggregates of ever-increasing size. In the mean-field approximation with mass independent reaction rates, we solve for the reaction kinetics and show that the concentration of clusters of mass $k$, $c_k(t)$, asymptotically scales as $A_k/t$, with $A_k$ having a non-trivial dependence on $k$. We also investigate the phenomenon of gelation in charged aggregation when the reaction rate equals the product of the two incident cluster masses. Finally, we generalize our model to the case of three and more types of monomers.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the Hydrostatic Stress for Hall Droplets with in-plane Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the hydrostatic stress of electrons strongly confined in a quasi-2D quantum well in the presence of a strong perpendicular and weak in-plane magnetic field. This introduces anisotropy into the stress tensor which is inconsistent with the notion of the quantum Hall droplet as a simple two-dimensional electron fluid. We show that the breaking of rotational symmetry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an anisotropic ground state stress tensor, and that the anisotropic stress originates primarily from quantum effects. We demonstrate this by decomposing the semiclassical trajectories of electrons in the system onto planes in phase space which must be rotated relative to the plane of the fluid to decouple the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entanglement with neutral atoms in the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum information processing with capabilities beyond that of classical computation. We study the generation and role of entanglement in the dynamics of spin-1/2 models, both for the design of quantum gates for general-purpose quantum computation and for quantum simulation of interacting spin models. We introduce the neutral atom M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, involving rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing interleaved in a spin-echo sequence. We show its robustness to quasi-static experimental imperfections and favorable scaling with the time-energy scales of Rydberg-mediated entanglement generation. In quantum simulation, we consider critical behavior in quench dynamics of transverse field Ising models. Using matrix product states to calculate the dynamics, we find that order parameters, critical point, and critical exponents can be estimated using modest bond dimensions. Considering the role of chaos and equilibration in quenches, we find that local observables are well approximated either due to low global entanglement or the proximity of local marginals to the maximally mixed state. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying relevant quantum phenomena that remain inaccessible to classical descriptions. Understanding the regimes where classical descriptions fail but remain accessible to pre-fault tolerant quantum hardware will help inform the design of future quantum information processors</description>

      <title>Probably the simplest and cheapest quantum Monte Carlo method so far for extracting high-precision entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\'enyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional ``spin'' systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Learning effective Hamiltonians for adaptive time-evolution quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation of many-body dynamics relies on Trotterization to decompose the target time evolution into elementary quantum gates operating at a fixed equidistant time discretization. Recent advances have outlined protocols enabling more efficient adaptive Trotter protocols, which have been shown to exhibit a controlled error in the dynamics of local observables and correlation functions. However, it has remained open to which extent the errors on the actual generator of the dynamics, i.e., the target many-body Hamiltonian, remain controlled. Here, we propose to use quantum Hamiltonian learning to numerically obtain the effective Hamiltonian and apply it on the recently introduced ADA-Trotter algorithm as a concrete demonstration. Our key observation is that deviations from the target generator remain bounded on all simulation times. This result suggests that the ADA-Trotter not only generates reliable digital quantum simulation of local dynamics, but also controllably approximates the global quantum state of the target system. Our proposal is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other adaptive time-evolution algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resource theory with covariant Gibbs-preserving operations, also called enhanced thermal operations, is investigated. We prove that with the help of a correlated catalyst, the state convertibility for any coherent state is fully characterized by the free energy defined with the quantum relative entropy. We can extend this result to general resource theories in the form that imposing the covariant condition to a general resource theory does not change the state convertibility as long as the initial state is coherent and distillable. This means that the additional constraint from the law of energy conservation is irrelevant in the correlated-catalytic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the high-temperature expansion of the free energy and arbitrary connected correlation functions of quantum spin systems can be recursively obtained from the exact renormalization group flow equation for the generating functional of connected spin correlation functions derived by Krieg and Kopietz [Phys. Rev. B 99, 060403(R) (2019)]. Our recursive algorithm can be explicitly written down in closed form including all combinatorial factors. We use our method to estimate critical temperatures of Heisenberg magnets from low-order truncations of the inverse spin susceptibility in the static limit. We also calculate the connected correlation function involving three different spin components (chiral non-linear susceptibility) of quantum Heisenberg magnets up to second order in the exchange couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhancements and entropic constraints to Boundary Time Crystals as sensors of AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: Recently, simple scaling laws concerning the mechanical response and mechanical transition of Kirigami have been revealed through agreement between theory and experiment for kirigami made of paper [M. Isobe and K. Okumura, Sci. Rep. 2016]. Here, we provide experimental data obtained from kirigami made of soft elastic sheets to demonstrate good agreement with previous theories, although a number of assumptions in the theory are violated and the elastic modulus is three orders of magnitude smaller in the present case. This remarkable universality in the mechanics of Kirigami, which could be useful for applications, is reported with physical insights based on previous theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic critical exponent $z$ characterizes the finite-size gap in gapless quantum many-body systems. We establish a rigorous lower bound $z \geq 2$ for frustration-free Hamiltonians on any lattice in any spatial dimension, given that their ground state exhibits a power-law decaying correlation function. This bound applies to representative classes of frustration-free Hamiltonians, including Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians, which are in one-to-one correspondence to Markov chains with locality, as well as parent Hamiltonians of critical projected entangled pair states with either a unique ground state or topologically degenerate ground states, and Hamiltonians with a plane-wave ground state.</description>

Abstract: Non-equivalence between the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble has been shown to arise for models defined by an extensive (i.e. scaling with the size of the system) number of constraints (e.g. the Configuration Model). Here, we compare the description length of binary canonical and microcanonical models in light of ensemble non-equivalence. Specifically, we consider the description length induced by the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML), which consists of two terms, i.e. a model log-likelihood and its complexity. While the effects of ensemble non-equivalence on the log-likelihood term are well understood, its effects on the complexity term have not yet been systematically studied. Here, we find that i) microcanonical models are always more complex than their canonical counterparts, ii) the best-scoring model in terms of description length highly depends on the numerical values of the constraints, and iii) the difference between the canonical and the microcanonical description length is strongly influenced by the degree of non-equivalence, a result suggesting that non-equivalence should be taken into account when selecting models. Finally, we compare the NML-based approach to model selection with the Bayesian one in light of our results, showing that the Bayesian description length becomes much more sensitive to the choice of the prior when an extensive number of constraints is involved</description>

Abstract: Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact. Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
  At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration, highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields, and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.</description>

Abstract: Circular Dyson Brownian motion describes the Brownian dynamics of particles on a circle (periodic boundary conditions), interacting through a logarithmic, long-range two-body potential. Within the log-gas picture of random matrix theory, it describes the level dynamics of unitary ("circular") matrices. A common scenario is that one wants to know about an initial configuration evolved over a certain interval of time, without being interested in the intermediate dynamics. Numerical evaluation of this is computationally expensive as the time-evolution algorithm is accurate only on short time intervals because of an underlying perturbative approximation. This work proposes an efficient and easy-to-implement improved circular Dyson Brownian motion algorithm for the unitary class (Dyson index $\beta = 2$, physically corresponding to broken time-reversal symmetry). The algorithm allows one to study time evolution over arbitrarily large intervals of time at a fixed computational cost, with no approximations being involved.</description>

Abstract: A pedagogical formulation of Loschmidt's paradox and H-theorem is presented with basic notation on occupancy on discrete states without invoking velocity collision operators. A conjecture, so called H-theorem do-conjecture, is formulated. Causal inference perspective on the dynamical evolution of classical many-particle system is invoked. This perspectice introduce a probabilistic view on the state of the system conditioning on the thermodyamic ensemble, i.e., function of state-variables representing the ensemble. A numerical simulation of random walkers for deterministic diffusion demonstrate the causal effect of interventional ensemble, showing a dynamical behaviour as a test of the proposed conjecture. Moreover, the chosen game like dynamics provides an accessible practical example, named Ising-Conway Entropy Game, in order to demonstrate increase in entropy over time, as a toy system of statistical physics.</description>

Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>

Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

Abstract: For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples, which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.</description>

Abstract: Why complex structures emerge in a real world environment is a fascinating question which has not found any fully satisfactory answer at the point of today. At the border between statistical physics, machine learning and network theory, we provide some computational empirical evidence indicating that the emergence of complex structures in the outer world is the macroscopic thermodynamic result of the optimal trade-off between the ability to encode information about the environment in the very features of the network and the ability to transmit information across it. While the former is quantified by the von Neumann network entropy and the latter by the Helmholtz free energy, the two are combined into a single quantity tantamount to the thermodynamic efficiency. We take as a case study an algorithm originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that, akin to living system, the algorithm seeks the best internal representation of the outer world, namely a real world dataset of patterns. Remarkably, the optimal thermodynamic efficiency overlaps with the optimal pattern-matching efficiency, defined in terms of accuracy and computational cost, whether the former is measured at the resolution scale where the network transits from exhibiting a specific heat with a single peak to a scale-invariant region. Moreover the critical hypothesis is investigated and empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the vicinity to the critical point whether it is faced with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>

      <title>Emergent time crystal from a fractional Langevin equation with white and colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractional Langevin equation with fractional $\alpha$-order and linear friction terms of a system coupled to white and colored thermal baths using both analytical and numerical methods. We find analytical expressions for the position and the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the system using the Prabhakar-Mittag-Leffler function. The MSD exhibits long-term sub-diffusive regimes $t^{\alpha}$ driven by colored noise and $t^{2\alpha-1}$ driven by white noise. When the linear friction is neglected, periodic ordered phases emerge for small fractional orders $\alpha \lesssim 0.1$. In particular, the zero-linear friction system driven only by colored noise manifests the properties of a time crystal, with a ground state satisfying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and a periodicity proportional to $2\pi$. On the other hand, the zero-linear friction system driven only by white noise displays an out-of-equilibrium time glass phase with periodicity proportional to $\pi$. A mixed phase with contributions from both ground and out-of-equilibrium states is encountered when the system couples to both baths. In that case, the periodicity deviates from $2\pi$ due to damping effects. We test all the analytical results numerically by implementing a discrete recursive expression, where the random forces of the system are modeled as the derivative of the fractional Brownian motion. A microscopic description for the system is also provided by an extension of the Caldeira-Leggett model.</description>

      <title>Generalised linear response theory for the full quantum work statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system driven out of equilibrium via a small Hamiltonian perturbation. Building on the paradigmatic framework of linear response theory (LRT), we derive an expression for the full generating function of the dissipated work. Remarkably, we find that all information about the distribution can be encoded in a single quantity, the standard relaxation function in LRT, thus opening up new ways to use phenomenological models to study non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex quantum systems. Our results establish a number of refined quantum thermodynamic constraints on the work statistics that apply to regimes of perturbative but arbitrarily fast protocols, and do not rely on assumptions such as slow driving or weak coupling. Finally, our approach uncovers a distinctly quantum signature in the work statistics that originates from underlying zero-point energy fluctuations. This causes an increased dispersion of the probability distribution at short driving times, a feature that can be probed in efforts to witness non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range gapped system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in exactly solvable lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum robustness of the toric code in a parallel field on the honeycomb and triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$ universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative $x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition. Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. All findings for the toric code on the honeycomb lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>The birth of StatPhys: The 1949 Florence conference at the juncture of national and international physics reconstruction after World War II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spring 1949 about 70 physicists from eight countries met in Florence to discuss recent trends in statistical mechanics. This scientific gathering, co-organized by the Commission on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the Italian Physical Society (SIF), initiated a tradition of IUPAP-sponsored international conferences on statistical mechanics that lasts to this day. In 1977, when this conference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the Florence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This paper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference, situating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in Italian physics and of the revitalization of the international science organization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we illustrate how the event's success hinged on the aligned objectives of its organizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and organizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a critical phase of IUPAP's history, when the Union was resurging on the international scene after the inactivity of the interwar period. Nationally, the conference served as a cornerstone in SIF's strategy to re-establish Italian physics' international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization of physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its flagship journal, \textit{Il Nuovo Cimento}. This analysis not only sheds light on the conference's impact but also informs recent discussions in the history of science about the multiple roles of international scientific conferences.</description>
