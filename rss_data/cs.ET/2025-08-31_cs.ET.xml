      <title>The WASM Cloak: Evaluating Browser Fingerprinting Defenses Under WebAssembly based Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Browser fingerprinting defenses have historically focused on detecting JavaScript(JS)-based tracking techniques. However, the widespread adoption of WebAssembly (WASM) introduces a potential blind spot, as adversaries can convert JS to WASM's low-level binary format to obfuscate malicious logic. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of how such WASM-based obfuscation impacts the robustness of modern fingerprinting defenses. We develop an automated pipeline that translates real-world JS fingerprinting scripts into functional WASM-obfuscated variants and test them against two classes of defenses: state-of-the-art detectors in research literature and commercial, in-browser tools. Our findings reveal a notable divergence: detectors proposed in the research literature that rely on feature-based analysis of source code show moderate vulnerability, stemming from outdated datasets or a lack of WASM compatibility. In contrast, defenses such as browser extensions and native browser features remained completely effective, as their API-level interception is agnostic to the script's underlying implementation. These results highlight a gap between academic and practical defense strategies and offer insights into strengthening detection approaches against WASM-based obfuscation, while also revealing opportunities for more evasive techniques in future attacks.</description>

      <title>SCE-NTT: A Hardware Accelerator for Number Theoretic Transform Using Superconductor Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research explores the use of superconductor electronics (SCE) for accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), focusing on the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key computational bottleneck in FHE schemes. We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on superconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high performance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To address SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout, we propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory (SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7 processing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual coefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and twiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized for a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell library with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was developed for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated using JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme was employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead, improving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art CMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger sizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput is estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing hardware. These results demonstrate the strong potential of SCE-based accelerators for scalable, energy-efficient secure computation in the post-quantum era, with further gains anticipated through advances in fabrication.</description>

      <title>FL-QDSNNs: Federated Learning with Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Federated Learning-Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks (FL-QDSNNs), a privacy-preserving framework that maintains high predictive accuracy on non-IID client data. Its key innovation is a dynamic-threshold spiking mechanism that triggers quantum gates only when local data drift requires added expressiveness, limiting circuit depth and countering the accuracy loss typical of heterogeneous clients. Evaluated on different benchmark datasets, including Iris, where FL-QDSNNs reach 94% accuracy, the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art quantum-federated baselines; scaling analyses demonstrate that performance remains high as the federation expands to 25 clients, confirming both computational efficiency and collaboration robustness. By uniting adaptive quantum expressiveness with strict data locality, FL-QDSNNs enable regulation-compliant quantum learning for privacy-sensitive sectors and critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>AI Simulation by Digital Twins: Systematic Survey, Reference Framework, and Mapping to a Standardized Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.</description>
