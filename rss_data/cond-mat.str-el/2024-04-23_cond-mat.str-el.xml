      <title>Structural modulation driven Curie temperature enhancement in Cr-doped SrRuO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated system with competing ground states are often poised close to the quantum critical point. External perturbations such as pressure, strain, electric field, and chemical doping can stabilise its ground state with exotic physical properties. Cr-doping is the lone exception which enhances the Curie-temperature in one of such correlated system SrRuO$_3$. To find the origin of $T_C$ enhancement, we investigate temperature-dependent structure, spectroscopic, magnetic and magnetotransport properties in SrRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$. Cr-doping squeezes the unit cell volume which effectively enhances the stretching octahedral distortion by nearly five times than pure SrRuO$_3$. The Curie temperature increment by $\sim$ 22 K for x = 0.15 is found to be intertwined with the structural-modulation. Temperature-dependent Neutron diffraction analysis indicate that the unit cell volume minima coincide exactly with the enhanced ferromagnetic ordering ($\sim$ 190 K). Further analysis reveals that the effect of Cr-doping not only freezes the octahedral tilt below 100 K but also suppresses the complex magnetism responsible for exchange bias and topological hall effect in SrRuO$_3$. The spectroscopic measurements find a reduction of itinerancy of d-electrons with Cr-doping. The magnetotransport measurements portray an evolution from itinerant to localised ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Evolution of ferrimagnetism against Griffiths singularity in Calcium Ruthenate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetism in the correlated metal CaRuO$_3$ is enigmatic as it is poised near a triple point among the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic ground states. Here we report a detailed work on structural, spectroscopic, magnetic, and transport properties in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$. We find that Cr doping reduces the orthorhombicity in CaRuO$_3$. Surprisingly, a tiny (x = 0.01) amount of Cr-doping drives the magnetic ground state from \enquote{paramagnetic-like} to ferrimagnetic. Slightly higher Cr-doping (x = 0.05) results formation of magnetic clusters which gives rise to Griffiths singularity and power law divergence in magnetic susceptibility. The magnetism in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ is explained in terms of \enquote{seven atom} ferrimagnetic clusters. Electrical transport shows a gradual evolution of a non-metallic state upon Cr-doping. In particular, for x $\geq$ 0.1, the temperature-dependent resistivity follows Mott-VRH conduction. The XPS study also supports significant role of disorder and electron correlation which effectively reduces the itinerant character of electrons. Finally, a new T-x phase diagram is constructed depicting the evolution of electronic and magnetic state in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline chiral soliton lattices in a Fibonacci helimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state magnetic configurations of a Fibonacci chain of classical spins with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions. Our analysis reveals a diverse array of magnetic textures induced by an external magnetic field perpendicular to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector. These textures exhibit a spectrum ranging from a quasi-fully polarized non-collinear state under high magnetic fields, capable of maintaining metastable chiral soliton topological defects, to a variety of quasicrystalline chiral soliton lattices below a critical field $H_c$. For a range of magnetic fields below $H_c$, the ground state spin textures result from the interplay between an effective quasiperiodic potential influencing the solitons and their repulsive interactions. At lower magnetic fields, the system experiences a commensurate-incommensurate transition, signified by the appearance of discommensurations in the quasicrystalline soliton lattice. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the ground state assumes a helical configuration with a quasiperiodic pitch angle.</description>

      <title>Extract Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy in a Single Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments of stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many body systems, we develop a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and corner entanglement boundaries in \textit{a single} quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different corner opening angles and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling and Planckian dissipation due to heavy-fermion quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical scaling associated with a Kondo-breakdown quantum critical point (KB-QCP) of the periodic Anderson model, treated by two-site cellular dynamical mean-field theory (2CDMFT). In the quantum critical region, the staggered spin exhibits SYK-like slow dynamics and its dynamical susceptibility shows $\omega/T$ scaling. We propose a scaling Ansatz that describes this behavior. It also implies Planckian dissipation for the longest-lived excitations. The current susceptibility follows the same scaling ansatz, leading to strange-metal scaling. This demonstrates that the KB-QCP described by 2CDMFT is an intrinsic (i.e., disorder-free) strange-metal fixed point. Surprisingly, the SYK-like dynamics and scaling are driven by strong vertex contributions to the susceptibilities. Our results for the optical conductivity match experimental observations on YbRh${}_2$Si${}_2$ and CeCoIn${}_5$.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced Kondo effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metals containing magnetic impurities, conduction electrons screen the magnetic impurities and induce the Kondo effect, i.e., the enhancement of the electrical resistance at low temperatures. Motivated by recent advances in manipulating quantum materials by cavity confinement, we study how the ultrastrong light-matter coupling can affect the Kondo effect. We show that the ultrastrong coupling can enhance the Kondo temperature and give rise to several notable phenomena, including universal scalings of the cavity-modified Kondo effect, the photon occupation number, and the entanglement entropy between the cavity and electrons. The origin of the cavity enhancement can be understood from the mass renormalization due to the cavity-mediated nonlocal electron-electron interaction, which is akin to the polaronic mass enhancement. We combine the unitary transformations and the Gaussian variational states to analyze the quantum impurity system confined in the cavity. Our nonperturbative framework can be applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems influenced by structured quantum electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spectra of Spin Supersolid States in Triangular Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ tensor network renormalization to explore the dynamical spectra of the easy-axis triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) in a magnetic field. Our analysis identifies two distinct low-energy magnon excitations: a gapless Goldstone mode and a gapped mode. At zero field, the spectra display two nearly degenerate roton modes near the M point. With the increase of the magnetic field within the Y-shape superfluid phase, these modes diverge, with the roton excitation vanishing from the Goldstone mode branch, suggesting that the roton dip in this mode may just result from the energy-level repulsion imposed by the roton excitation in the gapped mode. Moreover, the in-plane spectral function shows substantial weight in high energies in the same spin excitation channel where the low-energy roton excitation appears. However, these roton excitations are absent in the V-shape supersolid phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals with a skyrmion topological charge of 1 and 2 at a zero magnetic field. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>High Harmonic Tracking of Ultrafast Electron Dynamics across the Mott to Charge Density Wave Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different insulator phases compete with each other in strongly correlated materials with simultaneous local and non-local interactions. It is known that the homogeneous Mott insulator converts into a charge density wave (CDW) phase when the non-local interactions are increased, but there is ongoing debate on whether and in which parameter regimes this transition is of first order, or of second order with an intermediate bond-order wave phase. Here we show that strong-field optics applied to an extended Fermi-Hubbard system can serve as a powerful tool to reveal the nature of the quantum phase transition. Specifically, we show that in the strongly interacting regime characteristic excitations such as excitons, biexcitons, excitonic strings, and charge droplets can be tracked by the non-linear optical response to an ultrafast and intense laser pulse. Subcycle analysis of high harmonic spectra unravels the ultrafast dynamics of these increasingly complex objects, which partially escape the scrutiny of linear optics. Their appearance in the high harmonic spectrum provides striking evidence of a first-order transition into the CDW phase, and makes a strong case for using strong-field optics as a powerful tool to reveal the nature of quasiparticles in strongly correlated matter, and to track the electron dynamics during a first-order quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Band-asymmetry-driven nonreciprocal electronic transport in a helimagnetic semimetal {\alpha}-EuP$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures give rise to unconventional magnetotransport phenomena such as the topological Hall effect and nonreciprocal electronic transport. While the correspondence between real-space magnetic topology/symmetry and such transport phenomena has been well established, a microscopic understanding based on the spin-dependent band structure in momentum space remains elusive. Here we demonstrate how a chiral magnetic structure in real space introduces an asymmetry in the electronic band structure and triggers a nonreciprocal electronic transport in a centrosymmetric helimagnet {\alpha}-EuP$_3$. The magnetic structure of {\alpha}-EuP$_3$ is highly tunable by a magnetic field and closely coupled to its semi-metallic electronic band structure, enabling a systematic study across chiral and achiral magnetic phases on the correspondence between nonreciprocal transport and electronic band asymmetry. Our findings reveal how a microscopic change in the magnetic configuration of charge carriers can lead to nonreciprocal electronic transport, paving the way for designing chiral magnets with desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Importance of the semimetallic state for the quantum Hall effect in HfTe$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At ambient pressure, HfTe$_{5}$ is a material at the boundary between a weak and a strong topological phase, which can be tuned by changes in its crystalline structure or by the application of high magnetic fields. It exhibits a Lifshitz transition upon cooling, and three-dimensional (3D) quantum Hall effect (QHE) plateaus can be observed at low temperatures. Here, we have investigated the electrical transport properties of HfTe$_{5}$ under hydrostatic pressure up to 3 GPa. We find a pressure-induced crossover from a semimetallic phase at low pressures to an insulating phase at about 1.5 GPa. Our data suggest the presence of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition at low temperatures within the insulating phase around 2 GPa. The quasi-3D QHE is confined to the low-pressure region in the semimetallic phase. This reveals the importance of the semimetallic groundstate for the emergence of the QHE in HfTe$_{5}$ and thus favors a scenario based on a low carrier density metal in the quantum limit for the observed signatures of the quasi-quantized 3D QHE.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect from simulations on Euclidean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and features a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating perfect agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in RHIC isobar run.</description>

      <title>Protection of Correlation-Induced Phase Instabilities by Exceptional Susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At thermal equilibrium, we find that generalized susceptibilities encoding the static physical response properties of Hermitian many-electron systems possess inherent non-Hermitian (NH) matrix symmetries. This leads to the generic occurrence of exceptional points (EPs), i.e., NH spectral degeneracies, in the generalized susceptibilities of prototypical Fermi-Hubbard models, as a function of a single parameter such as chemical potential. We demonstrate that these EPs are necessary to promote correlation-induced thermodynamic instabilities, such as phase-separation occurring in the proximity of a Mott transition, to a topologically stable phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground states in kagome YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_{y}$]</title>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids represent exotic states of spin systems characterized by long-range entanglement and emergent fractionalized quasiparticles. It is generally believed that disorder is hostile to quantum spin liquids. In our study, we investigated the magnetic properties of a kagome system, YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_{y}$]. Within this system, some of the hexagons exhibit alternate bonds along the Cu-O-Cu exchange paths, while others remain uniform. We found that a long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges when uniform hexagons dominate. Conversely, possible quantum-spin-liquid state arises when the number of alternate-bond hexagons exceeds about 2/3. Therefore, the alternate-bond hexagons, typically considered as disorders, actually serve as the building blocks of the quantum spin liquid in this system. Notably, the low-temperature properties of the quantum spin liquid are directly associated with the height of the out-of-plane yttrium ions, which may be linked to changes in superexchange energies. Our results suggest that understanding the magnetic ground states in this system lies beyond the theoretical framework of the Heisenberg model constructed on the kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Unveiling chiral states of the XXZ chain: Finite-size scaling as a probe of quantum phase transition in symmetry-enriched $c=1$ conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy properties of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with time-reversal symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction and propose a phase diagram for the model. In the integrable case of the isotropic Heisenberg model with the chiral interaction, we employ the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to find ``chiralization", the response of the ground state versus the strength of the pseudo-scalar chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$ being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite chirality. We show for this particular case and conjecture more generally for similar phase transitions that the difference between two emergent CFTs with identical central charges lies in the symmetry of their ground state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point probes the transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum state reduction of general initial states through spontaneous unitarity violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inability of Schrodinger's unitary time evolution to describe measurement of a quantum state remains a central foundational problem. It was recently suggested that the unitarity of Schrodinger dynamics can be spontaneously broken, resulting in measurement as an emergent phenomenon in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a family of models for spontaneous unitarity violation that apply to generic initial superpositions over arbitrarily many states, using either single or multiple state-independent stochastic components. Crucially, we show that Born's probability rule emerges spontaneously in all cases.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries in (3+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries are important tools for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems. We investigate anomalies of non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d using 4+1d bulk topological quantum field theories given by Abelian two-form gauge theories, with a 0-form permutation symmetry. Gauging the 0-form symmetry gives the 4+1d "inflow" symmetry topological field theory for the non-invertible symmetry. We find a two levels of anomalies: (1) the bulk may fail to have an appropriate set of loop excitations which can condense to trivialize the boundary dynamics, and (2) the "Frobenius-Schur indicator" of the non-invertible symmetry (generalizing the Frobenius-Schur indicator of 1+1d fusion categories) may be incompatible with trivial boundary dynamics. As a consequence we derive conditions for non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d to be compatible with symmetric gapped phases, and invertible gapped phases. Along the way, we see that the defects characterizing $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ ordinary symmetry host worldvolume theories with time-reversal symmetry $\mathsf{T}$ obeying the algebra $\mathsf{T}^{2}=C$ or $\mathsf{T}^{2}=(-1)^{F}C,$ with $C$ a unitary charge conjugation symmetry. We classify the anomalies of this symmetry algebra in 2+1d and further use these ideas to construct 2+1d topological orders with non-invertible time-reversal symmetry that permutes anyons. As a concrete realization of our general discussion, we construct new lattice Hamiltonian models in 3+1d with non-invertible symmetry, and constrain their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fracton gauge fields from higher-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the fractonic dipole-conserving algebra can be obtained as an Aristotelian (and pseudo-Carrollian) contraction of the Poincar\'e algebra in one dimension higher. Such contraction allows to obtain fracton electrodynamics from a relativistic higher-dimensional theory upon dimensional reduction. The contraction procedure produces several scenarios including the some of the theories already discussed in the literature. A curved space generalization is given, which is gauge invariant when the Riemann tensor of the background geometry is harmonic.</description>

      <title>Probing the superconducting pairing of the La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ alloy via muon-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the superconducting pairing of the noncentrosymmetric La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ alloy using muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) technique. Below $T_c = 2.4$ K, La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ exhibits bulk superconductivity (SC), here characterized by heat-capacity and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$, extracted from the transverse-field {\textmu}SR measurements, reveals a nodeless SC in La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$. The best fit of $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$ using an $s$-wave model yields a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_0 = 542$ nm and a superconducting gap $\Delta_0 = 0.37$ meV at zero Kelvin. The single-gapped superconducting state is further evidenced by the temperature-dependent electronic specific heat $C_\mathrm{e}(T)/T$ and the linear field-dependent electronic specific-heat coefficient $\gamma_\mathrm{H}(H)$. The zero-field $\mu$SR spectra collected in the normal- and superconducting states of La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ are almost identical, confirming the absence of an additional field-related relaxation and, thus, of spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_c$. The nodeless SC combined with a preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state prove that the spin-singlet pairing is dominant in La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$. This material represents yet another example of a complex system showing only a conventional behavior, in spite of a noncentrosymmetric structure and a sizeable spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Cooper pairing, flat-band superconductivity and quantum geometry in the pyrochlore-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of the quantum geometry of Bloch states, specifically through the band-resolved quantum-metric tensor, on Cooper pairing and flat-band superconductivity in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-Hubbard model. First we analyze the low-lying two-body spectrum exactly, and show that the pairing order parameter is uniform in this four-band lattice. This allowed us to establish direct relations between the superfluid weight of a multiband superconductor and ($i$) the effective mass of the lowest-lying two-body branch at zero temperature, ($ii$) the kinetic coefficient of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in proximity to the critical temperature, and ($iii$) the velocity of the low-energy Goldstone modes at zero temperature. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of the superfluid weight and Goldstone modes, exploring both their conventional and geometric components at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Magnetism, Symmetries and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Equivariant Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel lemma in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This lemma generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>
