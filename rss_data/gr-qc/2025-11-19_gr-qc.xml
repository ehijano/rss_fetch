      <title>Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions - study of their behaviour in low energies and possible signals in the detection of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy gravities with Internal Interactions is based on the following two facts. The first is that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The second is that both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Here we would like to start by reviewing the gauge theoretic approach of gravities commenting in particular their diffeomorphism invariance. Then we will review the construction of the Conformal Gravity and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravity using the gauge theoretic framework. Finally based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group we will present the Unification of both Gravities with the Internal Interactions. Both unified schemes will be examined further concerning their behaviour in low energies after suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings as well as the possible signals of the related cosmic strings in the gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Twisting asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Bondi formalism to describe asymptotically-flat spacetimes where the outgoing null geodesic congruence is not hypersurface-orthogonal, i.e. has a non-vanishing twist. In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\text{Im}(\rho)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $\Psi_0=\Psi_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Decomposition for Relativistic Numerical Simulations: I. Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD is not known in a form useful for current numerical simulations. This prevents us from using the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. In this paper, we present a new method of finding decompositions. The method is based on transformations from the comoving frame, where the fluid flow is simplest and the decomposition has been known for a long time. The key innovation we introduce is that of quasi-invertible transformations. In this first paper, we introduce these transformations using the simpler example of relativistic hydrodynamics. We recover the known decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics in somewhat simpler form than previously derived, and without the need for computer algebra. A new result in this paper is the characteristic decomposition when the the evolution tracks the composition of a fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium. In Paper II of this series, we apply a quasi-invertible transformation to derive the complete characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the conserved variables used in simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the comoving frame of the fluid has been known for a long time. However, it has not been known in the coordinate frame of the simulation and in terms of the conserved variables evolved in typical numerical simulations. This paper applies the method of quasi-invertible transformations developed in Paper I to derive this decomposition. Among other benefits, this will allow us to use the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. The results turn out to be simpler than expected based on earlier attempts.</description>

      <title>Extremal isolated horizons of the NUT type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a construction of a new class of axisymmetric extremal isolated horizons admitting a structure of U(1)-principal fiber bundle over a two-sphere. In contrast to the previous examples, the null generators are assumed to be transversal to the bundle fibers. We impose the Einstein equations at the horizon and explicitly derive all intrinsic geometries of the extremal horizon, consisting of a two-sphere metric and a rotation 1-form, in the above class. The 2-geometries turn out to be equivalent to the classification of conically singular horizons with product topology. Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Hermitian formulation for mass dimension one fermions: Flat and curved space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we conduct our discussion by a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, introducing the Hermitian formulation for interacting mass dimension one fermions based on Elko spinor. It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of SdS Geodesics and using the Cosmological Horizon to Observe a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.</description>

      <title>Exact, non-singular black holes from a phantom DBI Field as primordial dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.</description>

      <title>A non-local origin for massive gravity and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{\mu\nu}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu}$, $R^{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{\Lambda CDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in $\gamma$-metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-metric, also known as Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, is a static, axially symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations characterized by two parameters: mass and the deformation parameter gamma. It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark matter-dark energy in generalized Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=\alpha\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto \rho_m$, $f \propto \rho_{de}$, and $f \propto \rho_m + \rho_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(\Omega_{de}, \Omega_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <title>Static Stellar Phase Transitions in General Relativity and a Generalized Buchdahl Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first general construction of solutions of the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler equations, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV-)equation, with prescribed density functions allowed to be discontinuous and non-uniform; these solutions describe stellar phase transitions in General Relativity. Boundedness of the resulting pressure functions solving the TOV-equations, from the boundary down to the stellar center, is obtained by identifying a novel condition on the prescribed density, in generalization of the classical Buchdahl limit. Moreover, we introduce a new necessary condition for the existence of such bounded pressure functions, which in the special case of a uniform density state reduces to the classical Buchdahl limit on the stellar mass-radius relationship. We present various examples to study the stellar mass-radius relationships resulting from our new conditions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics in $f(R,L_m,T)$ Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the accelerating phase of the Universe within the context of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$, $L_m$, and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar, matter Lagrangian, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We focus on a particular form of modified gravity defined by $f(R,L_m,T) = R - \mu L_m T - \gamma$, with $\mu$ and $\gamma$ being positive constants. The matter sector is characterized by the Lagrangian density $L_m = -\rho$, where $\rho$ denotes the energy density of the cosmological fluid. We conduct an in-depth examination of the model using phase space analysis, thoroughly evaluating the evolution of cosmological solutions with dynamical system techniques. The results is illustrated through graphs in the phase space, the characteristics of critical points and the stable attractors within the proposed modified gravity $f(R,L_m,T)$ cosmological framework. We investigate the transition from the initial decelerating phase of the universe to its current accelerating phase. The behaviour of the EoS, deceleration parameter with the appropriate initial conditions have been investigated.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Can Newtonian Gravity Produce Quantum Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23584v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we consider specific scenarios of matter-gravity interaction based on the source theory to clarify the issue regarding the Gravitationally Induced Entanglement (GIE) protocol, which posits that the detection of quantum entanglement induced by a pure gravitational effect serves as a probe of quantum gravity. Thus, the GIE protocol implies that classical gravity cannot produce or mediate quantum entanglement, to which a recent paper \cite{Aziz:2025ypo} shows the opposite. In all three scenarios of matter-gravity interactions, including mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity approaches, our results agree with the GIE protocol and its implications. More precisely, we show that the mesoscopic quantum bodies with their parities of mass quadrupoles interacting via Newtonian gravity can get entangled only if the parity of the gravitational tidal field sourced by the quantum body is also quantized. We also point out a possible loophole that could seemingly violate the GIE protocol due to the truncation of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion by orders of the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lighter-than-QCD Axions on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite density corrections to the lighter-than-QCD axion can invert the effective axion potential, sourcing a non-trivial axion field inside dense objects. We perform the first numerical study of the complete dynamics of the lighter-than-QCD axion in a neutron star in 1+1 general relativity, extending the region of analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths. We calculate gravitational effects of the axion field on the neutron star and show that for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants, neutron star properties, such as the mass, radius, and compactness, are affected at the order-1 level. This result indicates that approximate universal tidal deformability-compactness relation for neutron stars is non-trivially broken and can serve as a probe of lighter-than-QCD axions, independent of the unknown nuclear equation of state. We comment on the potential for axion studies with future gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars and applications of this work to other new physics signatures.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in Nuclear Star Clusters: A Combined Dynamical-Secular Channel for GW231123-like Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent binary black hole (BH) merger GW231123, with both components likely in the high-mass gap and with high spins, challenges standard BH binary formation models. It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Detecting these binaries would provide crucial insights into the dynamical pathways of hierarchical BH assembly.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Gravitational Waveform from Its Probe Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational observables for binary systems exhibit a simple polynomial dependence on the masses $m_1$, $m_2$ of the two scattering objects when they are written in terms of the appropriate kinematic variables in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime. We point out that this property, combined with particle interchange symmetry, allows one to reconstruct the leading and subleading PM waveforms from their probe limit, $m_1 \gg m_2$. As an application, focusing on their re-expansion in the small-velocity or post-Newtonian (PN) regime, we calculate the probe-limit waveforms up to 10PN, and then exploit this observation to deduce from them the waveforms for generic masses in the center-of-mass frame up to 5PN. To this end, we employ both the amplitude-based waveform integrands and the tail formula. This combined approach simplifies substantially the PN expansion of the full subleading PM waveform.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)^{\gamma(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.</description>

      <title>Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a &lt;= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a &gt; ac) in which eta(a) &gt; 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Model of Black Hole Evaporation with Controlled Causal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a four-qubit quantum circuit model of black hole evaporation that enforces semi-causality, a condition that allows information to enter a black hole but strictly forbids any information from escaping from the interior to outside through the horizon. In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Closing in on $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $\alpha$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $\alpha$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w&gt;1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $\alpha$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $\alpha\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincar\'e models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantization of General Relativity \`a la Ricci-Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We follow a new pathway to the definition of the Stochastic Quantization (SQ), first proposed by Parisi and Wu, of the action functional yielding the Einstein equations. Hinging on the functional similarities between the Ricci-Flow equation and the SQ Langevin equations proposed by Rumpf, we push forward a novel approach characterized by a multiplicative noise and a stochastic time that converges to the proper time of a space-like foliation in the equilibrium limit, where quantities have constant averages. We express the starting system of equations using the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and their conjugated Hamiltonian momenta. Such a choice is instrumental in understanding the newly derived equations in terms of the breakdown of the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical theory, which instead will hold on average at the steady state. We comment on the physical interpretation of the Ricci flow equations, and argue how they can naturally provide, in a geometrical way, the renormalization group equation for gravity theories. In the general setting, the equation associated to the shift vector yields the Navier-Stokes equation with a stochastic source. Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the metric tensor components around the equilibrium configurations, far away from the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, are forced by the Ricci flow to follow the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, whose probabilistic distribution can yield an intermittent statistics. We finally comment on the possible applications of this novel scenario to the cosmological constant, arguing that the Ricci flow may provide a solution to the Hubble tension, as a macroscopic effect of scale dependence of the quantum fluctuations of the metric tensor.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in \cite{aly2024nonlinearities} on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: This work reveals a fundamental link between general covariance and Birkhoff's theorem. We extend Birkhoff's theorem from general relativity to a broad class of generally covariant gravity theories formulated in the Hamiltonian framework. Conversely, we show that each one-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes determines a class of covariant theories, each of which has that family of spacetimes as its entire vacuum solution space. Our systematic and model-independent framework applies to a wide range of spacetimes, including observationally inferred, quantum-gravity-inspired, and regular black holes. It provides a universal tool for probing their dynamical origins and enables the reconstruction of the underlying covariant theories from observational data, including gravitational-wave and black-hole-shadow measurements.</description>

Abstract: We investigate light propagation in self-gravitating systems composed of an axially symmetric, stationary, rotating dust fluid. These configurations are intrinsically relativistic, sustained entirely by their rotation, since no compact or finite dust distribution can exist under the same symmetry conditions in Newtonian gravity. In such systems, rotational effects arise from off-diagonal components of the spacetime metric, which are not negligible compared to their Newtonian counterparts. We analyze how these components affect the deflection angle of light, showing that they can be interpreted as contributing an additional effective mass. Moreover, their presence can, in principle, be detected through the characteristic asymmetry they induce in the images of background sources.</description>

      <title>From quasi-local definitions to a dynamical potential: A unified framework for evolving circular orbits in dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of circular orbits is fundamental in gravitational physics, yet their definition in dynamical spacetimes remains challenging due to the lack of temporal symmetry. In this work, we establish a unified framework by commencing from the geometrically invariant quasi-local definition of a particle surface. We demonstrate that this definition naturally leads to a set of conditions that can be recast into the language of a coordinate-dependent dynamical potential. This potential serves as a practical computational tool for locating evolving circular orbits within a specific coordinate system. We rigorously prove the equivalence between the quasi-local and dynamical potential approaches in dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes. The efficacy and self-consistency of the dynamical potential method are explicitly verified through its application to the Oppenheimer-Snyder dust collapse model, where it correctly reproduces the established evolution equations for null and timelike circular orbits. This work bridges the gap between abstract geometric definitions and concrete calculations, providing a robust and adaptable framework for analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole Solutions in massive $F(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole geometries in the framework of $F(T)$ gravity supplemented by a weak de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive term. Using the static and spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne metric, we derive the field and conservation equations, separating the effective energy-momentum tensor into torsional and massive contributions. We analyze three representative classes of metric redshift functions, namely constant, logarithmic, and power-law forms, and two cases of the massive term, i.e. the general one and the uniform pressure case. The obtained solutions satisfy the flaring-out condition and remain asymptotically flat, while the effective matter sector can fulfill or only mildly violate the standard energy conditions. The results show that the inclusion of a small graviton mass provides an additional anisotropic pressure that can sustain the throat geometry without introducing exotic sources. In the limit of vanishing graviton mass, the configurations continuously reduce to the standard $F(T)$ wormhole solutions, confirming the consistency of the framework.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the Viability of Weak Energy Condition Violation in Parity-Violating Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic spacetimes often require violations of the weak energy condition (WEC), a feat that is difficult to achieve with realistic matter. We explore a conservative route to WEC violation within an effective field theory (EFT) by adding a single dimension-eight, parity-violating operator, proportional to \((F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta})(F_{\gamma\delta}\tilde F^{\gamma\delta})\), to the Maxwell action. We derive the modified Einstein and Maxwell equations and find that the electromagnetic stress--energy tensor is multiplied by a background-dependent factor \(\Omega=1+\zeta\mathcal P\), where \(\mathcal P\propto\vec E\cdot\vec B\). This allows, in principle, for WEC violation (\(\Omega&lt;0\)) when electric and magnetic fields are sufficiently aligned. Phenomenologically, the same operator induces vacuum birefringence. By comparing its predicted effect to laboratory (PVLAS) and astrophysical (magnetar X-ray polarimetry) data, we place stringent constraints on the coupling \(\zeta\). These constraints reveal that the threshold for WEC violation requires field strengths many orders of magnitude beyond any plausible astrophysical values and close to the EFT's breakdown scale. We also construct an exact flat-space solution at the \(\Omega=0\) threshold. We conclude that within this simple extension of electrodynamics, negative effective energy densities are mathematically possible but physically unreachable.</description>

Abstract: We disprove the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture, and thus demonstrate that the semi-classical properties of coupled gravitational and electromagnetic fields are more subtle than expected from Lorentzian general relativity, where the Kerr-Newman family of metrics yields the most general stationary and asymptotically flat black holes with a single event horizon. This is achieved by an explicit construction of a new three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. In the case of vanishing charge, these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>Acceleration radiation from vibrating atoms in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Dolan \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{New J. Phys. 22, 033026 (2020)}], we study the acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$ outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the Floquet transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega &gt; \omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$, which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$, in agreement with Near the horizon, $f(R_0)&lt;1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the spectrum weighted by the Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known pathological behavior of the Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically tractable link between flat-space vibrating atom proposals and black-hole spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: This study combines theoretical advancements with observational limitations to investigate the cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) in a Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) in (3+1) dimensional spacetime framework. We provide analytical solutions for both viscous and non-viscous cases, pointing out variations in the energy density evolution, the Hubble parameter dynamics, and the deceleration parameter transitions. Bulk viscosity suppresses oscillations in structure creation, a well-known drawback of Chaplygin gas models in larger dimensions, as shown by a thorough perturbation analysis. Using the bulk viscosity coefficient and Hubble expansion parameter, which are incorporated by the total pressure and the appropriate pressure and by using energy momentum conservation law determined time time-dependent density. With the help of three conditions ($\xi = 0$, $\xi\neq0$, and we neglect both bulk viscosity and presence of Chaplygin gas, i.e $A=0$ and $\xi=0$) created three different models as the Hubble parameter is a function of redshift $z$. By applying the MCMC method to these models, we have gone through observational analysis by using the Hubble and BAO datasets.</description>

      <title>Topological Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Revisiting the methods of winding numbers calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $\phi$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer--Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer--Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

In the case of wormholes symmetric across the throat, we study the matter content and analyze the stability of the static configurations under radial perturbations.

      <description>arXiv:2511.13423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Coherence--Curvature Model (CCM), a dynamical ensemble of connected graphs governed by a Hamiltonian that couples algebraic connectivity, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and an edge-density penalty. Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds &gt; dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting the best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, and instead of looking into the complex effects of (pre-)reheating, we focus on the corrections arising purely from more accurate analytical evaluations of the perturbations generated during the inflationary era itself. This is because the reheating dynamics is model-dependent and lack a single concrete analytical description, and thus introduce large uncertainties, making robust predictions difficult. In this article, we mainly incorporate two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution and, thus, the end of inflation, and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

      <title>Threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not necessarily asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter, $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used, contrary to expectations. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>New Exceptional EFTs in de Sitter Space from Generalised Energy Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a surprising relationship between exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in de Sitter space and a notion of \textit{generalised energy conservation} (GEC) of an S-matrix defined in an extended Poincar\'{e} patch of four-dimensional de Sitter. By demanding that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal, we constrain the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars living in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations. We rediscover the theories of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon, and when increasing the conformal dimension we find evidence for new exceptional theories where the four-point scalar self interactions are uniquely fixed in terms of a single coupling constant. We conjecture that for each integer conformal dimension $\Delta \geq 4$, there is at least one exceptional EFT that can be entirely fixed by GEC.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass: Extending the topological classification of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a novel topological subclass, dubbed $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$, in the thermodynamics of higher odd-dimensional, multiply rotating Kerr-AdS black holes. This discovery extends the established topological classification beyond the five classes and two subclasses previously known. The $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass exhibits a unique and previously unreported stability profile: it admits a thermodynamically stable small black hole state in the low-temperature limit, while in the high-temperature limit, the phase space simultaneously contains one stable large black hole, one stable small black hole, and one unstable small black hole state. Our analysis, which treats black hole solutions as topological defects, reveals a richer landscape of black hole thermodynamics than previously understood and necessitates an expansion of the topological classification scheme to accommodate this new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Thermodynamics of Dynamical Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>IR/UV mixing from higher-order interactions in a Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the calculated cosmological constant, when regularized with a cutoff, differs hugely from the measured value. These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results.</description>
