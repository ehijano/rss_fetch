Abstract: In 1989 H.Karcher rewrote the theory of elliptic functions through an approach that is much more geometrical than analytical. Therewith he obtained an optimal control over the behaviour and image values of these functions, which allowed for their broad application in minimal surfaces. Our work is devoted to presenting the theory of elliptic functions according to Karcher's approach, as well as some of its applications in minimal surfaces.

      <title>On the existence of a balanced vertex in geodesic nets with three boundary vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesic nets are types of graphs in Riemannian manifolds where each edge is a geodesic segment. One important object used in the construction of geodesic nets is a balanced vertex, where the sum of unit tangent vectors along adjacent edges is zero. In 2021, Parsch proved the upper bound for the number of balanced vertices of a geodesic net with three unbalanced vertices on surfaces with non-positive curvature. We extend his result by proving the existence of a balanced vertex of a triangle (with three unbalanced vertices) on any two-dimensional surface when all angles measure less than $2\pi/3$, if the length of the sides of the triangle are not too large. This property is also a generalization for the existence of the Fermat point of a planar triangle.</description>

      <title>Some characterizations of Riemannian manifolds endowed with a conformal vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the presence of a conformal vector $\xi$ with conformal factor $\rho$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with or without boundary $\partial M$. We firstly prove that a compact Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)\,,n \geq 3,$ with constant scalar curvature, with boundary $\partial M$ totally geodesic, in such way that the traceless Ricci curvature is zero in the direction of $\nabla \rho,$ is isometric to a standard hemisphere. In the $4$-dimensional case, under the condition $\displaystyle\int_M|\mathring{Ric}|^2\langle \xi,\nabla \rho\rangle \,dM\leq0$, we show that, either $M$ is isometric to a standard sphere, or $M$ is isometric to a standard hemisphere. Finally, we give a partial answer for the cosmic no-hair conjecture.</description>

      <title>Positive scalar curvature and isolated conical singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Geroch type result for isolated conical singularity. Namely, we show that there is no Riemannian metric $g$ on $ X \# T^n $ with an isolated conical singularity which has nonnegative scalar curvature on the regular part, and is positive at some point. In particular, this implies that there is no metric on tori with an isolated conical singularity and positive scalar curvature. We also prove that a scalar flat Riemannian metric $g$ on $X \# T^n$ with finitely many isolated conical singularities must be flat, and extend smoothly across the singular points. We do not a priori assume that a conically singular point on $X$ is a manifold point; i.e., the cross section of the conical singularity may not be spherical.</description>

Abstract: Assuming Calabi symmetry, we prove that a numerical condition ensures the solvability of the complex $(k,l)$-Hessian equation, as conjectured by Sz\'ekelyhidi. We also propose a conjecture on the existence of a $k$-subharmonic representative in a given cohomology class and confirm it under the assumption of Calabi symmetry or when the class is semiample.</description>

      <title>The Ricci curvature and the normalized Ricci flow on the Stiefel manifolds $\operatorname{SO}(n)/\operatorname{SO}(n-2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved that on every Stiefel manifold $V_2\mathbb{R}^n\cong \operatorname{SO}(n)/\operatorname{SO}(n-2)$ with $n\ge 3$ the normalized Ricci flow preserves the positivity of the Ricci curvature of invariant Riemannian metrics with positive Ricci curvature. Moreover, the normalized Ricci flow evolves all metrics with mixed Ricci curvature into metrics with positive Ricci curvature in finite time. From the point of view of the theory of dynamical systems we proved that for every invariant set~$\Sigma$ of the normalized Ricci flow on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as $x_1^{n-2}x_2^{n-2}x_3=c$, $c&gt;0$, there exists a smaller invariant set $\Sigma\cap \mathscr{R}_{+}$ for every $n\ge 3$, where~$\mathscr{R}_{+}$ is the domain in $\mathbb{R}_{+}^3$ responsible for parameters $x_1, x_2, x_3&gt;0$ of invariant Riemannian metrics on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ admitting positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>An extension of Liebmann's Theorem to surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liebmann's Theorem is a fundamental result stating that a compact connected convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant mean curvature (cmc) is a totally umbilical sphere. We extend this theorem to surfaces with boundary by showing that a locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surface, bounded by a convex curve in a plane $P$, is contained in one of the halfspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$ determined by $P$. This extension leads to the conclusion that spherical caps are the only examples of locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surfaces with non-zero curvature, bounded by a circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

      <title>Deformations of singularities of meromorphic $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections and meromorphic quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the theory of singularities of meromorphic linear ODEs in traceless $2\times2$ cases, focusing on their deformations and confluences.
  It is divided into two parts:
  The first part addresses individual singularities without imposing restrictions on their type or degeneracy. The main result establishes a correspondence between local formal invariants and jets of meromorphic quadratic differentials. This result is then utilized to describe the parameter space of universal isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections over Riemann surfaces.
  The second part examines the confluence of singularities in a fully general setting, accommodating all forms of degeneracies. It explores the relationship between the geometry of the unfolded Stokes phenomenon and the horizontal and vertical foliations of parametric families of quadratic differentials. The local moduli space is naturally identified with a specific space of local monodromy and Stokes data, presented as a space of representations of certain fundamental groupoids associated with the foliations. This is then used for studying degenerations of isomonodromic deformations in parametric families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a result that relates Donaldson-Futaki type invariants (that is, the numerical invariants used to define $K$-stability for general polarised manifolds) for a toric polarised manifold and for a compactification of its mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, nearby the large volume limit. In general, this expansion contains a term involving the base loci of certain linear systems determined by the Landau-Ginzburg potential (as expected from known constructions of compactified mirrors), and we give a condition under which this term is subleading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend and generalize the result of Rohleder by proving that the j+2:nd eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is less than or equal to the j:th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian for any compact Lipschitz domain in dimension two or greater.</description>

Abstract: This article constructs the moduli stack of torsionfree $G$-jet-structures in homotopy type theory with one monadic modality. This yields a construction of this moduli stack for any $\infty$-topos equipped with any stable factorization systems.
  In the intended applications of this theory, the factorization systems are given by the deRham-Stack construction. Homotopy type theory allows a formulation of this abstract theory with surprising low complexity. This is witnessed by the accompanying formalization of large parts of this work.</description>

      <title>Properties and Transformations of Weingarten Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weingarten relations satisfied by rotationally symmetric surfaces in Euclidean 3-space E3 are considered from three points of view: restrictions on the slope of the relation at umbilic points, the action of SL2(R) as fractional linear transformations on the space of curvatures, and variational formulations for the relations. With regard to the first, we obtain bounds on the slope of a Weingarten relation in terms of the fall off of the radii of curvature at an umbilic point. This generalizes recent work by a number of authors. For the second, we show that the action descends from curvature space to E3 and splits into three natural geometric actions. This is applied to a class of Weingarten surfaces, called semi-quadratic, on which the action is shown to be transitive. Finally, a natural Lagrangian formulation is given for certain types of Weingarten relations and stability established.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stable for the Positive Mass Theorem in the following sense. Let $(M_i,g_i)$ be a sequence of complete asymptotically flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and suppose that the ADM mass $m(g_i)$ of one end of $M_i$ converges to $0$. Then for all $i$, there is a subset $Z_i$ in $M_i$ such that $M_i\setminus Z_i$ contains the given end, the area of the boundary $\partial Z_i$ converges to zero, and $(M_i\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology for any choice of basepoints. This confirms a conjecture of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen. Additionally, we find an almost quadratic upper bound for the area of $\partial Z_i$ in terms of $m(g_i)$. As an application of the main result, we also prove R. Bartnik's strict positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Harmonic projections in negative curvature II: large convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of harmonic maps is due to Benoist--Hulin: given a quasi-isometry $f:X\to Y$ between pinched Hadamard manifolds, there exists a unique harmonic map at a finite distance from $f$. Here we show existence of harmonic maps under a weaker condition on $f$, that we call non-collapsing -- we require that the following two conditions hold uniformly in $x\in X$: (1) average distance from $f(x)$ to $f(y)$ for $y$ on the sphere of radius $R$ centered at $x$ grows linearly with $R$ (2) the pre-image under $f$ of small cones with apex $f(x)$ have low harmonic measures on spheres centered at $x$. Using these ideas, we also continue the previous work of the author on existence of harmonic maps that are at a finite distance from projections to certain convex sets. We show this existence in a pinched negative curvature setting, when the convex set is large enough. For hyperbolic spaces, this includes the convex hulls of open sets in the sphere at infinity with sufficiently regular boundary.</description>

      <title>Tubes and Steklov eigenvalues in negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Steklov eigenvalue problem on a compact pinched negatively curved manifold $M$ of dimension at least three with totally geodesic boundaries. We obtain a geometric lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue in terms of the total volume of $M$ and the volume of its boundary. We provide examples illustrating the necessity of these geometric quantities in the lower bound. Our result can be seen as a counterpart of the lower bound for the first nonzero Laplace eigenvalue on closed pinched negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three proved by Schoen in 1982.
  The proof is composed of certain key elements. We provide a uniform lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Steklov-Dirichlet problem on a neighborhood of the boundary of $M$ and show that it provides an obstruction to having a small first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue. As another key element of the proof, we give a tubular neighborhood theorem for totally geodesic hypersurfaces in a pinched negatively curved manifold. We give an explicit dependence for the width function in terms of the volume of the boundary and the pinching constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we genelize the Heintze-Karcher type inequalities for fractional Q-curvature $Q_{2\gamma}$ on conformally compact Einstein manifolds. Such inequality holds for all $\gamma\in (0,1]$. In particular, for $\gamma=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\gamma=1$, we obtain some rigidity theorems by characterising the equalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate elliptic operators with a symmetry that forces their index to vanish. We study the secondary index, defined modulo 2. We examine Callias-type operators with this symmetry on non-compact manifolds and establish mod 2 versions of the Gromov-Lawson relative index theorem, the Callias index theorem, and the Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent structures of oriented neutral vector bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nilpotent structures of an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4n$ with a neutral metric $h$ and an $h$-connection $\nabla$. We define $H$-nilpotent structures of $(E, h, \nabla )$ for a Lie subgroup $H$ of $SO(2n, 2n)$ related to neutral hyperK\"{a}hler structures. We observe that there exist a complex structure $I$ and paracomplex structures $J_1$, $J_2$ of $E$ such that $h$, $\nabla$, $I$, $J_1$, $J_2$ form a neutral hyperK\"{a}hler structure of $E$ if and only if there exists an $H$-nilpotent structure of $(E, h, \nabla )$.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of parabolically convex domains in hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a parabolically convex domain $M\subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$, $n\ge 3$, we prove that if $f:(N,\bar g)\to (M,g)$ has nonzero degree, where $N$ is spin with scalar curvature $R_N\ge -n(n-1)$, and if $f|_{\partial N}$ does not increase the distance and the mean curvature, then $N$ is hyperbolic, and $\partial N$ is isometric to $\partial M$. This is a partial generalization of Lott's result \cite{lott2021index} to negative lower bounds of scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>RC-positivity, Schwarz's lemma and comparison theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the classical Schwarz lemma yields an explicit comparison of two Hermitian metrics with uniform constant negative curvature bounds through holomorphic maps between complex manifolds. In this paper, we establish Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic bundle maps between abstract Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles with various positive curvature bounds. As applications, we prove Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic maps between complex manifolds whose curvature tensors are described by the notion ``RC-positivity''. In particular, new diameter and volume comparison theorems are obtained by using Schwarz lemmas.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>
