      <title>Study of Robust Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Multiple-Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free networks outperform cellular networks in many aspects, yet their efficiency is affected by imperfect channel state information (CSI). In order to address this issue, this work presents a robust resource allocation framework designed for the downlink of user-centric cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. This framework employs a sequential resource allocation strategy with a robust user scheduling algorithm designed to maximize the sum-rate of the network and two robust power allocation algorithms aimed at minimizing the mean square error, which are developed to mitigate the effects of imperfect CSI. An analysis of the proposed robust resource allocation problems is developed along with a study of their computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust resource allocation algorithms, showing a performance improvement of up to 30\% compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>A general secondary construction of Boolean functions including the indirect sum and its generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a secondary construction of Boolean functions, which generalizes the direct sum and the indirect sum. We detail how these two classic secondary constructions are particular cases of this more general one, as well as two known generalizations of the indirect sum. This unifies the known secondary constructions of Boolean functions. We study very precisely the Walsh transform of the constructed functions. This leads us to an interesting observation on the Walsh transforms $W_g,W_{g'},W_{g''}$, and $W_{g\oplus g'\oplus g''}$ when $g,g',g''$ are Boolean functions such that $(g\oplus g')(g\oplus g'')$ equals the zero function.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies, this work is more focused on the impact of resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes i.i.d. complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is $\log\left(1+\gamma\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where $\gamma$ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the MSE also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by $\log\left(1+\mathsf {mmse}\cdot\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and is equal to the minimum of $\gamma$. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, including how small rate losses decay to zero and achievable rate approximations under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several per-bit rules for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.</description>

      <title>Unifying concepts in information-theoretic time-series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory is a powerful framework for quantifying complexity, uncertainty, and dynamical structure in time-series data, with widespread applicability across disciplines such as physics, finance, and neuroscience. However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Nested-Lattice Quantized Matrix Multiplication with Small Lookup Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work have shown that the quantization for matrix multiplication problem can be optimally solved by quantizing each column in each matrix using a nested lattice code, and then multiplying the de-quantized matrices. It was further demonstrated that when product codes of sub-dimension $d$ and rate $R$ are used, the de-quantization and inner product operations can be implemented with querying a lookup table (LUT) of size $2^{2dR}$, but this is only useful when $dR$ is sufficiently small. This in turn limits LUT-based inner product decoding to low-rate quantizers. In this work, we develop a rate $R$ hierarchical nested lattice quantization framework, which quantizes each vector to $M$ layers, and admits LUT-based inner product decoding using an LUT of size $2^{2d\frac{R}{M}}$, allowing for high-rate quantization. We provide analytic bounds on the loss of the developed scheme compared to standard nested lattice quantizers, and also numerically illustrate that this loss is negligible. Thus, our scheme enables to use small LUTs without compromising the overall distortion.</description>

      <title>Neural-Enhanced Rate Adaptation and Computation Distribution for Emerging mmWave Multi-User 3D Video Streaming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multitask edge-user communication-computation resource allocation for $360^\circ$ video streaming in an edge-computing enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user virtual reality system. To balance the communication-computation trade-offs that arise herein, we formulate a video quality maximization problem that integrates interdependent multitask/multi-user action spaces and rebuffering time/quality variation constraints. We formulate a deep reinforcement learning framework for \underline{m}ulti-\underline{t}ask \underline{r}ate adaptation and \underline{c}omputation distribution (MTRC) to solve the problem of interest. Our solution does not rely on a priori knowledge about the environment and uses only prior video streaming statistics (e.g., throughput, decoding time, and transmission delay), and content information, to adjust the assigned video bitrates and computation distribution, as it observes the induced streaming performance online. Moreover, to capture the task interdependence in the environment, we leverage neural network cascades to extend our MTRC method to two novel variants denoted as R1C2 and C1R2. We train all three methods with real-world mmWave network traces and $360^\circ$ video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of expected quality of experience (QoE), viewport peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. We outperform state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithms, with C1R2 showing best results and achieving $5.21-6.06$ dB PSNR gains, $2.18-2.70$x rebuffering time reduction, and $4.14-4.50$ dB quality variation reduction.</description>

      <title>Grid Topology Estimation using an Information Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. Experiments and results are presented to optimize this approach with success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks generated by the European Union Joint Research Council.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Hybrid Language Model via Uncertainty-Aware Opportunistic and Compressed Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model (LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability. Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while maintaining 97.4% accuracy.</description>

      <title>K*-Means: A Parameter-free Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a widely used and powerful machine learning technique, but its effectiveness is often limited by the need to specify the number of clusters, k, or by relying on thresholds that implicitly determine k. We introduce k*-means, a novel clustering algorithm that eliminates the need to set k or any other parameters. Instead, it uses the minimum description length principle to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, k*, by splitting and merging clusters while also optimising the standard k-means objective. We prove that k*-means is guaranteed to converge and demonstrate experimentally that it significantly outperforms existing methods in scenarios where k is unknown. We also show that it is accurate in estimating k, and that empirically its runtime is competitive with existing methods, and scales well with dataset size.</description>

      <title>XiSort: Deterministic Sorting via IEEE-754 Total Ordering and Entropy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce XiSort, a deterministic and reproducible sorting algorithm for floating-point sequences based on IEEE-754 total ordering and entropy minimization. XiSort guarantees bit-for-bit stability across runs and platforms by resolving tie-breaking via information-theoretic and symbolic methods. The algorithm supports both in-memory and external (out-of-core) operation, offering consistent performance on large datasets. We formalize a curved variant of the sorting metric that integrates into the Alpay Algebra framework, treating XiSort as a recursive operator with provable convergence and symbolic idempotence. This model preserves state-space closure while minimizing local disorder, interpretable as symbolic entropy. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that XiSort achieves competitive throughput (e.g., sorting 10^8 doubles in approximately 12 seconds in-memory, and 100 GB at around 100 MB/s on SSDs), with applications in scientific computing, high-frequency finance, and reproducible numerical workflows. The results position XiSort as a principled tool for stable data alignment, symbolic preprocessing, and cross-platform float ordering.

      <title>Attribution Projection Calculus: A Novel Framework for Causal Inference in Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain, ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including large language models. Theoretical verification shows that AP-Calculus not only extends but can also subsume traditional do-calculus for many practical applications, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Behavior Synthesis via Contact-Aware Fisher Information Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact dynamics hold immense amounts of information that can improve a robot's ability to characterize and learn about objects in their environment through interactions. However, collecting information-rich contact data is challenging due to its inherent sparsity and non-smooth nature, requiring an active approach to maximize the utility of contacts for learning. In this work, we investigate an optimal experimental design approach to synthesize robot behaviors that produce contact-rich data for learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware Fisher information measure that characterizes information-rich contact behaviors that improve parameter learning. We observe emergent robot behaviors that are able to excite contact interactions that efficiently learns object parameters across a range of parameter learning examples. Last, we demonstrate the utility of contact-awareness for learning parameters through contact-seeking behaviors on several robotic experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Performance Analysis of IoT-over-LEO Satellite Systems under Realistic Operational Constraints: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current theoretical studies on IoT-over-LEO satellite systems often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as infinite terrestrial areas and omnidirectional satellite coverage, leaving significant gaps in theoretical analysis for more realistic operational constraints. These constraints involve finite terrestrial area, limited satellite coverage, Earth curvature effect, integral uplink and downlink analysis, and link-dependent interference. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a novel stochastic geometry based model to rigorously analyze the performance of IoT-over-LEO satellite systems. By adopting a binomial point process (BPP) instead of the conventional Poisson point process (PPP), our model accurately characterizes the geographical distribution of a fixed number of IoT devices in a finite terrestrial region. This modeling framework enables the derivation of distance distribution functions for both the links from the terrestrial IoT devices to the satellites (T-S) and from the satellites to the Earth station (S-ES), while also accounting for limited satellite coverage and Earth curvature effects. To realistically represent channel conditions, the Nakagami fading model is employed for the T-S links to characterize diverse small-scale fading environments, while the shadowed-Rician fading model is used for the S-ES links to capture the combined effects of shadowing and dominant line-of-sight paths. Furthermore, the analysis incorporates uplink and downlink interference, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of system performance. The accuracy and effectiveness of our theoretical framework are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. These results provide insights into key performance metrics, such as coverage probability and average ergodic rate, for both individual links and the overall system.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Double Near-Far Problem via Wireless Powered Pinching-Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel wireless powered communication system, referred to as a wireless powered pinching-antenna network (WPPAN), utilizing a single waveguide with pinching antennas to address the double near-far problem inherent in wireless powered networks. In the proposed WPPAN, users harvest energy from spatially distributed pinching antennas in the downlink and use the collected power to transmit messages in the uplink. Furthermore, to manage the combinatorial complexity associated with activating the pinching antennas, we propose three approaches of varying complexity to simplify the original resource allocation problem and then solve it efficiently using convex optimization methods. Simulation results confirm that the proposed WPPAN system effectively mitigates the double near-far problem by providing antenna resources closer to the users, thereby enhancing both downlink energy harvesting and uplink data transmission.</description>

      <title>Measuring Information Distortion in Hierarchical Ultra long Novel Generation:The Optimal Expansion Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question: how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&amp;Write, and Long Writer have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical two-stage generation pipeline (outline -&gt; detailed outline -&gt; manuscript) and find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with LLMs to create million-word novels.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces as Anchors for Near-Field Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a recent investigation on leveraging large reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as anchors for positioning in wireless communication systems. Unlike existing approaches, we explicitly address the uncertainty arising from the substantial physical size of the RIS, particularly relevant when a user equipment resides in the near field, and propose a method that ensures accurate positioning under these conditions. We derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound for our scheme and validate the effectiveness of our scheme through numerical experiments, highlighting both the feasibility and potential of our approach.</description>

      <title>AdaToken-3D: Dynamic Spatial Gating for Efficient 3D Large Multimodal-Models Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($&lt;$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Prototype and Performance Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental prototype of a reflective beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), i.e., a RIS with reconfigurable inter-element connections. Our BD-RIS consists of an antenna array whose ports are terminated by a tunable load network. The latter can terminate each antenna port with three distinct individual loads or connect it to an adjacent antenna port. Extensive performance evaluations in a rich-scattering environment validate that inter-element connections are beneficial. Moreover, we observe that our tunable load network's mentioned hardware constraints significantly influence, first, the achievable performance, second, the benefits of having inter-element connections, and, third, the importance of mutual-coupling awareness during optimization.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.</description>

      <title>Explicit Representatives and Sizes of Cyclotomic Cosets and their Application to Cyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclotomic coset is a classical notion in the theory of finite field which has wide applications in various computation problems. Let $q$ be a prime power, and $n$ be a positive integer coprime to $q$. In this paper we determine explicitly the representatives and the sizes of all $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ in the general settings. We introduce the definition of $2$-adic cyclotomic system, which is a profinite space consists of certain compatible sequences of cyclotomic cosets. A precise characterization of the structure of the $2$-adic cyclotomic system is given, which reveals the general formula for representatives of cyclotomic cosets. With the representatives and the sizes of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$, we improve the formulas for the factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ and of $\Phi_{n}(X)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ given in \cite{Graner}. As a consequence, we classify the cyclic codes over finite fields via giving their generator polynomials. Moreover, the self-dual cyclic codes are determined and enumerated.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) is a revolutionary flexible antenna technology designed to enhance wireless communication by establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, reducing free-space path loss and enabling antenna array reconfigurability. PASS uses dielectric waveguides with low propagation loss for signal transmission, radiating via a passive pinching antenna, which is a small dielectric element applied to the waveguide. This paper first proposes a physics-based hardware model for PASS, where the pinching antenna is modeled as an open-ended directional coupler, and the electromagnetic field behavior is analyzed using coupled-mode theory. A simplified signal model characterizes the coupling effect between multiple antennas on the same waveguide. Based on this, two power models are proposed: equal power and proportional power models. Additionally, a transmit power minimization problem is formulated/studied for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming under both continuous and discrete pinching antenna activations. Two algorithms are proposed to solve this multimodal optimization problem: the penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm and a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm. Numerical results show that 1) the ZF-based low-complexity algorithm performs similarly to the penalty-based algorithm, 2) PASS reduces transmit power by over 95% compared to conventional and massive MIMO, 3) discrete activation causes minimal performance loss but requires a dense antenna set to match continuous activation, and 4) the proportional power model yields performance comparable to the equal power model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces AutoBS, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimal base station (BS) deployment in 6G radio access networks (RAN). AutoBS leverages the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and fast, site-specific pathloss predictions from PMNet-a generative model for digital network twins (DNT). By efficiently learning deployment strategies that balance coverage and capacity, AutoBS achieves about 95% of the capacity of exhaustive search in single BS scenarios (and in 90% for multiple BSs), while cutting inference time from hours to milliseconds, making it highly suitable for real-time applications (e.g., ad-hoc deployments). AutoBS therefore provides a scalable, automated solution for large-scale 6G networks, meeting the demands of dynamic environments with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been many constructions of minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from Boolean functions, linear codes with few nonzero weights or partial difference sets. In this paper, we first give a general method to transform a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition to a minimal code violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give a construction of a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from an arbitrary projective linear code. Hence an arbitrary projective linear code can be transformed to a minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give infinite many families of minimal codes violating the Ashikhamin-Barg condition. Weight distributions of constructed minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition in this paper are determined. Many minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition with their minimum weights close to the optimal or the best known minimum weights of linear codes are constructed in this paper. Moreover, many infinite families of self-orthogonal binary minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition are also given.</description>

      <title>Dual-UAV-Enabled Secure Communication and Sensing for A2G-ISAC Systems with Maneuverable Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar, the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication (SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain: An Alternative To Mutual Information For Science And Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his 1948 seminal paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication that birthed information theory, Claude Shannon introduced mutual information (MI), which he called "rate of transmission", as a way to quantify information gain (IG) and defined it as the difference between the marginal and conditional entropy of a random variable. While MI has become a standard tool in science and engineering, it has several shortcomings. First, MI is often intractable - it requires a density over samples with tractable Shannon entropy - and existing techniques for approximating it often fail, especially in high dimensions. Moreover, in settings where MI is tractable, its symmetry and insensitivity to sample similarity are undesirable. In this paper, we propose the Vendi Information Gain (VIG), a novel alternative to MI that leverages the Vendi scores, a flexible family of similarity-based diversity metrics. We call the logarithm of the VS the Vendi entropy and define VIG as the difference between the marginal and conditional Vendi entropy of a variable. Being based on the VS, VIG accounts for similarity. Furthermore, VIG generalizes MI and recovers it under the assumption that the samples are completely dissimilar. Importantly, VIG only requires samples and not a probability distribution over them. Finally, it is asymmetric, a desideratum for a good measure of IG that MI fails to meet. VIG extends information theory to settings where MI completely fails. For example, we use VIG to describe a novel, unified framework for active data acquisition, a popular paradigm of modern data-driven science. We demonstrate the advantages of VIG over MI in diverse applications, including in cognitive science to model human response times to external stimuli and in epidemiology to learn epidemic processes and identify disease hotspots in different countries via level-set estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Scheduling in Distributed Networked Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a joint uplink and downlink scheduling problem of a fully distributed wireless networked control system (WNCS) with a limited number of frequency channels. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a sufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both the control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark policies.</description>

      <title>An additive refinement of quantum channel capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capacities of quantum channels are fundamental quantities in the theory of quantum information. A desirable property is the additivity for a capacity. However, this cannot be achieved for a few quantities that have been established as capacity measures. Asymptotic regularization is generically necessary making the study of capacities notoriously hard. In this work, by a proper refinement of the physical settings of quantum communication, we prove additive quantities for quantum channel capacities that can be employed for quantum Shannon theorems. This refinement, only a tiny step away from the standard settings, is consistent with the principle of quantum theory, and it further demonstrates von Neumann entropy as the cornerstone of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Scalable Exploration via Ensemble++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thompson Sampling is a principled method for balancing exploration and exploitation, but its real-world adoption faces computational challenges in large-scale or non-conjugate settings. While ensemble-based approaches offer partial remedies, they typically require prohibitively large ensemble sizes. We propose Ensemble++, a scalable exploration framework using a novel shared-factor ensemble architecture with random linear combinations. For linear bandits, we provide theoretical guarantees showing that Ensemble++ achieves regret comparable to exact Thompson Sampling with only $\Theta(d \log T)$ ensemble sizes--significantly outperforming prior methods. Crucially, this efficiency holds across both compact and finite action sets with either time-invariant or time-varying contexts without configuration changes. We extend this theoretical foundation to nonlinear rewards by replacing fixed features with learnable neural representations while preserving the same incremental update principle, effectively bridging theory and practice for real-world tasks. Comprehensive experiments across linear, quadratic, neural, and GPT-based contextual bandits validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate Ensemble++'s superior regret-computation tradeoff versus state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Bounds for Scalar Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents tight upper and lower bounds for minimum number of samples (copies of a quantum state) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters estimation using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. Particularly, the best-case (optimal) scenario is considered by minimizing the sample complexity over all differentially-private channels; the worst-case channels can be arbitrarily uninformative and render the problem ill-defined. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under local differential privacy. The lower bound however loosens in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$. The upper bound for the minimum number of samples is generalized to qudits (with dimension $d$) resulting in sample complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <title>Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</description>

      <title>Minimum Description Length of a Spectrum Variational Autoencoder: A Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained through end-to-end learning have achieved remarkable success across various domains in the past decade. However, the end-to-end learning strategy faces two fundamental limitations: the struggle to form explainable representations in a self-supervised manner, and the inability to compress information rigorously following the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. In this paper, we establish a novel theory connecting these two challenges. We design the Spectrum VAE, a novel deep learning architecture whose minimum description length (MDL) can be rigorously evaluated. Then, we introduce the concept of latent dimension combinations, or what we term spiking patterns, and demonstrate that the observed spiking patterns should be as few as possible based on the training data in order for the Spectrum VAE to achieve the MDL. Finally, our theory demonstrates that when the MDL is achieved with respect to the given data distribution, the model will naturally produce explainable latent representations of the data. That is, explainable representations of the data, or understanding the data, can be achieved in a self-supervised manner simply by making the deep neural network obey the MDL principle. In our opinion, this reveals an even more profound principle: Understanding means to represent the acquired information by as small an amount of information as possible. This work is entirely theoretical and aims at inspiring future research to realize self-supervised explainable AI simply by obeying the MDL principle.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge Acquisition and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09597v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</description>
