      <title>Impact of newly measured $\beta$\nobreakdash-delayed neutron emitters around \myisoSimp{78}{Ni} on light element nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-wind following a neutron star merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron emission probabilities and half-lives of 37 beta-delayed neutron emitters from 75Ni to 92Br were measured at the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan, including 11 one-neutron and 13 two-neutron emission probabilities and 6 half-lives measured for the first time, which supersede theoretical estimates. These nuclei lie in the path of the weak r-process occurring in neutrino-driven winds from the accretion disk formed after the merger of two neutron stars, synthesizing elements in the A~80 abundance peak. The presence of such elements dominates the accompanying kilonova emission over the first few days and has been identified in the AT2017gfo event, associated with the gravitational wave detection GW170817.
  Abundance calculations based on over 17000 simulated trajectories describing the evolution of matter properties in the merger outflows show that the new data lead to an increase of 50-70 percent in the abundance of Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo. This enhancement is large compared to the scatter of relative abundances observed in old very metal-poor stars and is therefore significant in the comparison with other possible astrophysical processes contributing to light-element production.
  These results underline the importance of including experimental decay data for very neutron-rich beta-delayed neutron emitters into r-process models.</description>

      <title>Physics with high-luminosity proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics case for the operation of high-luminosity proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions during Run 3 and 4 at the LHC is reviewed. The collection of $\mathcal{O}$(1-10 pb$^{-1}$) of proton-lead ($p$Pb) collisions at the LHC will provide unique physics opportunities in a broad range of topics including proton and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs and nPDFs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), transverse momentum dependent PDFs (TMDs), low-$x$ QCD and parton saturation, hadron spectroscopy, baseline studies for quark-gluon plasma and parton collectivity, double and triple parton scatterings (DPS/TPS), photon-photon collisions, and physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM); which are not otherwise as clearly accessible by exploiting data from any other colliding system at the LHC. This report summarises the accelerator aspects of high-luminosity $pA$ operation at the LHC, as well as each of the physics topics outlined above, including the relevant experimental measurements that motivate -- much -- larger $pA$ datasets.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in two-quasiparticle-triaxial-rotor systems: Chirality, wobbling, and the Pauli effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement in two-quasiparticle plus triaxial-rotor (PTR) model for the particle-hole configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1 \otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^{-1}$, the particle-particle configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1 \otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^1$, and two-proton particles configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^2$ for different values of the triaxiality parameter. The entanglement between the angular momenta of the two quasiparticles and the total angular momentum is quantified by the three bipartite concurrences $\mathcal{C}$ of one type of angular momentum with the other two angular momenta and the area $\mathcal{F}$ of the triangle formed by the bipartite concurrences. Collective chiral and wobbling modes are identified for $\gamma&gt;15^\circ$ via spin coherent state (SCS) maps and spin squeezed state (SSS) plots. Their entanglement increases from moderate values at the band head to near-maximal values at $I=20$. The area $\mathcal{F}$ of the chiral partners changes order as function of $I$ which reflects the crossing of the partner bands as a signature of chirality. For the $\pi(1h_{11/2})^2$ configuration, the antisymmetrization required by the Pauli exclusion principle causes strong entanglement between the two protons, which significantly amplifies the area $\mathcal{F}$. For $\gamma&lt;15^\circ$, the lowest bands become various uniformly rotating quasiparticle configurations, which have large values of $\mathcal{F}$ for all values $I$.</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>Overview of high-density QCD studies with the CMS experiment at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review key measurements performed by CMS in the context of its heavy ion physics program, using event samples collected in 2010-2018 with several collision systems and energies. These studies provide detailed macroscopic and microscopic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created at the LHC energies, a medium characterized by the highest temperature and smallest baryon-chemical potential ever reached in the laboratory. Numerous observables related to high-density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) were studied, leading to some of the most impactful and qualitatively novel results in the 40-year history of the field. Using a dedicated high-multiplicity trigger in the first pp run, CMS discovered that small collision systems can exhibit signs of collectivity, a generic phenomenon with significant implications and presently understood to affect essentially all soft physics processes. This observation opened new paths to understand how fluidity and plasma properties emerge in QCD matter as a function of system size. Measurements of jet quenching have reached a completely new level of detail by directly assessing, for the first time, the medium modification of parton showers, as opposed to simply observing leading hadrons or di-hadrons. The first fully reconstructed beauty hadron and heavy-flavor jet nuclear modifications were also measured. The large size of the event samples, the precision of the measurements, and the extension of the probed kinematical phase space, allowed many other hard probes of the QGP medium to be explored in detail, leading to multiple groundbreaking findings. In particular, the seminal measurements of bottomonium suppression patterns answer fundamental questions that have been actively pursued, both theoretically and experimentally, by the community since the mid-1980s. We conclude by outlining the opportunities offered by the continuation of this physics program at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about annihilation photon polarization is unavailable. Here, we present a PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, where annihilation photons primarily interact via the Compton effect, providing information about both photon polarization and propagation direction. Using this plastic-based PET, we determined the distribution of the relative angle between polarization planes of photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum-entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and para-positronium annihilations are maximally entangled. Our result indicates that the degree of entanglement depends on the annihilation mechanism in matter, opening new avenues for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a diagnostic indicator.</description>

      <title>Astromeric nature of $^{119m}$Ag unveiled through direct mass measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of elements heavier than iron produced via the astrophysical rapid-neutron capture process depends sensitively on the atomic mass of the involved nuclei as well as the behavior of a few special types of nuclear isomers called astromers. High-precision mass measurements of $^{119}$Cd, $^{119}$Ag and their respective isomeric states have been performed with the Phase Imaging-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (PI-ICR) method with a precision of $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ using the Canadian Penning Trap (CPT). The ground state mass excess, as well as the excitation energy, agrees with recent Penning Trap measurements from JYFLTRAP. Network calculations using these new measurements revealed that, contrary to previous expectations, $^{119m}$Ag behaves as an astromer which significantly affects the population of $^{119}$Ag.</description>

      <title>Ab initio nuclear shape coexistence and emergence of island of inversion around $N=20$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a nuclear ab initio framework based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions to investigate shape coexistence and the degradation of the $N=20$ magic number in both even-even and odd-even magnesium isotopes. The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach reasonably reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, and allows us to track the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the continuous IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that the ground state of $^{33}$Mg with spin-parity $3/2^-$ is predominantly a strongly deformed configuration with $K^\pi = 3/2^-$, while the lowest $7/2^-$ state is predicted to be a shape isomer, consisting of a mixture of weakly deformed configurations with different $K$ values. The results highlight the essential roles of both dynamical and static collective correlations in reproducing the ordering of nuclear states with distinct shapes.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector heavy tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>
