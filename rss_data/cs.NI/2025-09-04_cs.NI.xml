      <title>BISCAY: Practical Radio KPI Driven Congestion Control for Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile application performance relies heavily on the congestion control design of the underlying transport, which is typically bottlenecked by cellular link and has to cope with rapid cellular link bandwidth fluctuations. We observe that radio KPI measurements from the mobile device chipset can be exploited for precise and timely measurement of available bandwidth on the cellular link. Building on this insight, we propose Biscay, a practical and radio KPI-driven congestion control system design for mobile networks. Biscay leverages OpenDiag, the in-kernel real-time radio KPI extraction tool we introduce in this paper, along with our KPI-based accurate bandwidth determination layer towards dynamically adjusting the congestion window to optimally use the available bandwidth while keeping delay to the minimum. Our solution is practical and deployable, as shown through our implementation of Biscay and OpenDiag on unrooted Android 5G phones. We extensively evaluate Biscay against different state-of-the-art congestion control designs including BBR and CUBIC with emulations driven by real measurement traces as well as real-world experiments spanning diverse 4G and 5G scenarios, and show that it provides significant average and tail delay improvements (typically over 90% reduction) while yielding better or similar throughput. These gains are enabled by 100% improvement in the granularity of on-device radio KPI measurements with OpenDiag compared to existing alternatives like MobileInsight.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of LoRa for IoT Applications in Non-Terrestrial Networks via ns-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) has emerged as a key paradigm to provide connectivity for sensors and actuators via satellite gateways in remote areas where terrestrial infrastructure is limited or unavailable. Among other Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies for IoT, Long Range (LoRa) holds great potential given its long range, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and performance of LoRa to support large-scale IoT connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite gateways. To do so, we developed a new ns3-LoRa-NTN simulation module, which integrates and extends the ns3-LoRa and ns3-NTN modules, to enable full-stack end-to-end simulation of satellite communication in LoRa networks. Our results, given in terms of average data rate and Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), confirm that LoRa can effectively support direct communication from the ground to LEO satellites, but network optimization is required to mitigate collision probability when end nodes use the same Spreading Factors (SFs) over long distances.</description>

      <title>GPS Spoofing Attacks on Automated Frequency Coordination System in Wi-Fi 6E and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6 GHz spectrum, recently opened for unlicensed use under Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7, overlaps with frequencies used by mission-critical incumbent systems such as public safety communications and utility infrastructure. To prevent interference, the FCC mandates the use of Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) systems, which assign safe frequency and power levels based on Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)-reported locations. In this work, we demonstrate that GPS-based location reporting, which Wi-Fi APs use, can be spoofed using inexpensive, off-the-shelf radio equipment. This enables attackers to manipulate AP behavior, gain unauthorized spectrum access, cause harmful interference, or disable APs entirely by spoofing them into foreign locations. We validate these attacks in a controlled lab setting against a commercial AP and evaluate a commercial AFC system under spoofed scenarios. Our findings highlight critical gaps in the security assumptions of AFC and motivate the need for stronger location integrity protections.</description>

      <title>Closing the Visibility Gap: A Monitoring Framework for Verifiable Open RAN Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is reshaping mobile network architecture by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability. However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges, especially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However, this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compromised components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps).
  To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring framework for low-trust O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable, verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations. We implement and evaluate the framework using standardized O-RAN configurations, with total processing latency of approximately 200 ms, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality for timely policy enforcement and compliance auditing in multi-MNO deployments.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer Digital Twin System for Future Mobile Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, the communication networks are expected to face unprecedented challenges in terms of complexity and dynamics. Digital Twin (DT) technology, with its various digital capabilities, holds great potential to facilitate the transformation of the communication network from passive responding to proactive adaptation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a multi-layer DT system that coordinates local DT, edge DT, and cloud DT for future network architecture and functions. In our vision, the proposed DT system will not only achieve real-time data-driven decision-making and digital agent functions previously handled by centralized DT, but will do so in a more distributed, mobile, layer-by-layer manner. Moreover, it will supply essential data, pre-trained models, and open interfaces for future metaverse applications, enabling creators and users to efficiently develop and experience metaverse services.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 5G O-RAN Performance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN) elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures. We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints. This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Dependency Chain Analysis of ROS 2 DDS QoS Policies: From Lifecycle Tutorial to Static Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) relies on the Data Distribution Service (DDS), which offers more than 20 Quality of Service (QoS) policies governing availability, reliability, and resource usage. Yet ROS 2 users lack clear guidance on safe policy combinations and validation processes prior to deployment, which often leads to trial-and-error tuning and unexpected runtime failures. To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber communication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and Disassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS policies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS dependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41 dependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause communication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2 package that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts, and enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2 session. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight and a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations, improving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Low-Altitude Wireless Network Empowered Air Traffic Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the increasing development of low-altitude aircrafts, the rational design of low-altitude networks directly impacts the aerial safety and resource utilization. To address the challenges of environmental complexity and aircraft diversity in the traffic management, we propose a hierarchical low-altitude wireless network (HLWN) framework. Empowered by the threedimensional spatial discretization and integrated wireless monitoring mechanisms in HLWN, we design low-altitude air corridors to guarantee safe operation and optimization. Besides, we develop the multi-dimensional flight risk assessment through conflict detection and probabilistic collision analysis, facilitating dynamic collision avoidance for heterogeneous aircrafts. Finally, the open issues and future directions are investigated to provide insights into HLAN development.</description>

      <title>\textit{In Silico} Benchmarking of Detectable Byzantine Agreement in Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA), where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA implementations in realistic, noisy environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.</description>

      <title>RouteNet-Gauss: Hardware-Enhanced Network Modeling with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network simulation is pivotal in network modeling, assisting with tasks ranging from capacity planning to performance estimation. Traditional approaches such as Discrete Event Simulation (DES) face limitations in terms of computational cost and accuracy. This paper introduces RouteNet-Gauss, a novel integration of a testbed network with a Machine Learning (ML) model to address these challenges. By using the testbed as a hardware accelerator, RouteNet-Gauss generates training datasets rapidly and simulates network scenarios with high fidelity to real-world conditions. Experimental results show that RouteNet-Gauss significantly reduces prediction errors by up to 95% and achieves a 488x speedup in inference time compared to state-of-the-art DES-based methods. RouteNet-Gauss's modular architecture is dynamically constructed based on the specific characteristics of the network scenario, such as topology and routing. This enables it to understand and generalize to different network configurations beyond those seen during training, including networks up to 10x larger. Additionally, it supports Temporal Aggregated Performance Estimation (TAPE), providing configurable temporal granularity and maintaining high accuracy in flow performance metrics. This approach shows promise in improving both simulation efficiency and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for network operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular-connected UAV systems have enabled a wide range of low-altitude aerial services. However, these systems still face many challenges, such as frequent handovers and the inefficiency of traditional transport protocols. To better study these issues, we develop a modular and scalable simulation platform specifically designed for UAVs communication leveraging the research ecology in wireless communication of MATLAB. The platform supports flexible 5G NR node deployment, customizable UAVs mobility models, and multi-network-interface extensions. It also supports multiple transport protocols including TCP, UDP, QUIC, etc., allowing to investigate how different transport protocols affect UAVs communication performance. In addition, the platform includes a handover management module, enabling the evaluation of both traditional and learning-based handover strategies. Our platform can serve as a testbed for the development and evaluation of advanced transmission strategies in cellular-connected UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on replicated databases modeled by a simple graph. In this model, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side common randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the servers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common randomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable SPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the minimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a message. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR capacity for the class of path and regular graphs.</description>
