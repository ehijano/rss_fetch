      <title>Reconstruction of heat relaxation index in phonon transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nano-materials, heat conductivity is an ill-defined concept. This classical concept assumes the validity of Fourier's law, which states the heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient, with heat conductivity used to denote this ratio. However, this macroscopic constitutive relation breaks down at nano-scales. Instead, heat is propagated using phonon transport equation, an ab initio model derived from the first principle. In this equation, a material's thermal property is coded in a coefficient termed the relaxation time ($\tau$). We study an inverse problem in this paper, by using material's temperature response upon heat injection to infer the relaxation time. This inverse problem is formulated in a PDE-constrained optimization, and numerically solved by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method and its variants. In the execution of SGD, Fr\'echet derivative is computed and Lipschitz continuity is proved. This approach, in comparison to the earlier studies, honors the nano-structure of of heat conductivity in a nano-material, and we numerically verify the break down of the Fourier's law.</description>

      <title>Construction of exact refinements for the two-dimensional HB/THB-spline de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the de Rham complex is a natural choice when working with problems in electromagnetics and fluid mechanics. By discretizing the complex correctly, it is possible to attain stable numerical methods to tackle these problems. An important consideration when constructing the discrete complex is that it must preserve the cohomology structure of the original one. This property is not guaranteed when the discrete function spaces chosen are hierarchical B-splines. Research shows that a poor choice of refinement domains may give rise to spurious harmonic forms that ruin the accuracy of solutions, even for the simplest partial differential equations. Another crucial aspect to consider in the hierarchical setting is the notion of admissibility, as it is possible to obtain optimal convergence rates of numerical solutions by limiting the multi-level interaction of basis functions. We will focus on the two-dimensional de Rham complex over the unit square $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. In this scenario, the discrete de Rham complex should be exact, and we provide both the theoretical and the algorithm-implementation framework to ensure this is the case. Moreover, we show that, under a common restriction, the admissibility class of the first space of the discrete complex persists throughout the remaining spaces. Finally, we include numerical results that motivate the importance of the previous concerns for the vector Laplace and Maxwell eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two approaches for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure: the inexact Lanczos method and inexact polynomial-filtered subspace iteration. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank polynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) stagnates.</description>

      <title>Rootfinding and Optimization Techniques for Solving Nonlinear Systems of Equations Arising from Cohesive Zone Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While approaches to model the progression of fracture have received significant attention, methods to find the solution to the associated nonlinear equations have not. In general, nonlinear solution methods and optimization methods have a rich body of work spanning back to at least the first century, providing the opportunity for advancement in the field of computational discrete damage modeling. In this paper, we explore the performance of established methods when applied to problems involving cohesive zone models to identify promising methods for further improvement in this specialized application. We first use a simple 1D example problem with low degrees of freedom (DoF) to compare nonlinear solution methods, thereby allowing for both straightforward and intuitive visualization of the residual space and reasoning about the cause for each method's performance. We then explore the impact of higher DoF discretizations of the same problem on the performance of the solution methods. Finally, we discuss techniques to improve performance or to overcome limitations of the various methods.</description>

      <title>Partial Condition Numbers for Double Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for investigating the partial condition number (CN) of the solution of double saddle point problems (DSPPs) and provides closed-form expressions for it. This unified framework encompasses the well-known partial normwise CN (NCN), partial mixed CN (MCN) and partial componentwise CN (CCN) as special cases. Furthermore, we derive sharp upper bounds for the partial NCN, MCN and CCN, which are computationally efficient and free of expensive Kronecker products. By applying perturbations that preserve the structure of the block matrices of the DSPPs, we analyze the structured partial NCN, MCN and CCN when the block matrices exhibit linear structures. By leveraging the relationship between DSPP and equality constrained indefinite least squares (EILS) problems, we recover the partial CNs for the EILS problem. Numerical results confirm the sharpness of the derived upper bounds and demonstrate their effectiveness in estimating the partial CNs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Active Element Patterns for 2-D Planar Array Antennas via Directional Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active element pattern method is widely employed in beam pattern synthesis of array antenna to account for mutual coupling between antenna elements. Calculating the active element patterns for large number of array requires full-wave analyses of total array structure, which is time consuming. To obtain accurate active element patterns efficiently, this letter proposes a method to estimates active element patterns in largely arrayed antenna using directional decomposition approach. Reducing computational cost, proposed method constructs the transfer matrices to reflect both mutual coupling and truncation effects between each antenna element. Numerical validation with open-ended waveguides confirms that the proposed method can estimate active element patterns with high accuracy. The synthesized beam patterns show mean squared errors below 0.1dB in the main lobe region for various beam steering cases. The computational complexity for numerical analysis reduces from $\mathcal{O}(M_B^2(N_x^3 N_y^3))$ to $\mathcal{O}(M_B^2(N_x^3 + N_y^3))$, resulting in a reduction of computation time to under 0.095\% compared to the conventional active element pattern method.</description>

      <title>A Multiple Transferable Neural Network Method with Domain Decomposition for Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transferable neural network (TransNet) is a two-layer shallow neural network with pre-determined and uniformly distributed neurons in the hidden layer, and the least-squares solvers can be particularly used to compute the parameters of its output layer when applied to the solution of partial differential equations. In this paper, we integrate the TransNet technique with the nonoverlapping domain decomposition and the interface conditions to develop a novel multiple transferable neural network (Multi-TransNet) method for solving elliptic interface problems, which typically contain discontinuities in both solutions and their derivatives across interfaces. We first propose an empirical formula for the TransNet to characterize the relationship between the radius of the domain-covering ball, the number of hidden-layer neurons, and the optimal neuron shape. In the Multi-TransNet method, we assign each subdomain one distinct TransNet with an adaptively determined number of hidden-layer neurons to maintain the globally uniform neuron distribution across the entire computational domain, and then unite all the subdomain TransNets together by incorporating the interface condition terms into the loss function. The empirical formula is also extended to the Multi-TransNet and further employed to estimate appropriate neuron shapes for the subdomain TransNets, greatly reducing the parameter tuning cost. Additionally, we propose a normalization approach to adaptively select the weighting parameters for the terms in the loss function. Ablation studies and extensive experiments with comparison tests on different types of elliptic interface problems with low to high contrast diffusion coefficients in two and three dimensions are carried out to numerically demonstrate the superior accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed Multi-TransNet method.</description>

      <title>Highly Scalable Two-level Monolithic Overlapping Schwarz Preconditioners for Thermo-elastoplastic Laser Beam Welding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermo-elastoplastic finite element approach is used to perform the simulation of a laser beam welding (LBW) process. This results in a nonlinear, nonsymmetric saddle point multiphysics system, for which the nonlinearity is handled via the Newton method. The iterative solution of the arising linear system is accelerated by using robust and highly scalable, overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners. It is well-known that a one-level method of this type is not scalable and therefore a second level has to be added. Therefore, the construction and numerical analysis of monolithic, two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioners with different variants of the GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space are presented here. A new and parallel efficient implementation of several variants of GDSW, that is, GDSW, RGDSW, and GDSW*, in PETSc, is introduced, which is usable for multiphysics problems, as, for example, the thermo-mechanical LBW problem considered here. Different combinations of the GDSW variants for the different fields (temperature and displacements) are compared and parallel scalability for realistic problems is shown.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spectral element method for the stationary Stokes interface problem in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a higher-order spectral element method for the two-dimensional Stokes interface problem involving a piecewise constant viscosity coefficient. The proposed numerical formulation is based on least-squares formulation. The mesh is aligned with the interface, and the interface is completely resolved using blending element functions. The higher-order spectral element functions are nonconforming, and the same-order approximation is used for both velocity and pressure variables. The interface conditions are added to the minimizing functional in appropriate Sobolev norms. Stability and error estimates are proven. The proposed method is shown to be exponentially accurate in both velocity and pressure variables. The theoretical estimates are validated through various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation with spin-torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-induced magnetisation dynamics in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures can be described by the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation with spin-torque terms. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the global strong solution to the model in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, with an additional smallness assumption on the initial data if $d=3$. We then propose a fully discrete linearly implicit finite element scheme for the problem and prove that it approximates the solution with an optimal order of convergence, provided the exact solution possesses adequate regularity. Furthermore, we propose an unconditionally energy-stable finite element method to approximate the LLB equation without spin current. This scheme also converges to the exact solution at an optimal order, and is shown to be energy-dissipative at the discrete level. Finally, some numerical simulations to complement the theoretical analysis are included.</description>

      <title>DFPI, A unified framework for deflated linear solvers: bridging the gap between Krylov subspace methods and Fixed-Point Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative algorithms are instrumental in modern numerical simulation for solving systems arising from the discretization of PDEs. They face however significant challenges in industrial applications, such as slow convergence, limit cycle oscillations, or iterations blow-up. An ideal preconditioner is rarely available and naive approaches such as Richardson iterations often fail to converge on complex cases, calling for generic sophistications such as deflation techniques and/or Krylov subspaces approaches. However the quest for an optimal general linear solver is still open and a matter of active research.
  This paper introduces a new theoretical framework, called DFPI (Deflated Fixed Point Iterations) for the iterative solution of linear systems. It unifies several existing acceleration and stabilization techniques such as RPM, BoostConv and Anderson acceleration, and bridges the gap between Richardson iterations and Krylov subspace methods, including GMRES, PCG, BiCGStab and variants. DFPI is structured around two key building blocks : the choice of a projection operator, on the one hand and the trouble vectors recruitment strategy, on the other hand. A general convergence result will be presented, showing the choice of a specific projection operator has minimal impact as long as the projection space remains invariant by the iteration matrix. However when this is not guaranteed, a minimization principle becomes a must have. Finally numerical comparisons will be conducted on a variety of relevant CFD cases.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Robust Reformulation of the UVN-Flash Problem via Direct Entropy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase equilibrium problem for multicomponent mixtures under specified internal energy (U), volume (V), and mole numbers (N1,N2, . . . ,Nn), commonly known as the UVN-flash problem. While conventional phase equilibrium calculations typically use pressure-temperature-mole number (PTN) specifications, the UVN formulation is essential for dynamic simulations of closed systems and energy balance computations. Existing approaches, including those based on iterative pressure-temperature updates and direct entropy maximization, suffer from computational inefficiencies due to nested iterations and reliance on inner Newton solvers. In this work, we present a novel reformulation of the UVN-flash problem as a direct entropy maximization problem that eliminates the need for inner Newton iterations, addressing key computational bottlenecks. We derive two new novel formulations: 1) a formulation based on entropy and internal energy and (2) an alternative formulation based on Helmholtz free energy. We begin with a stability analysis framework, followed by a reformulation of the UVN flash problem in natural variables. We then introduce our novel approach and discuss the numerical methods used, including gradient and Hessian computations. The proposed method is validated against benchmark cases, demonstrating improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Pseudo-symplectic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduces a Pseudo-Symplectic Neural Network (PSNN) for learning general Hamiltonian systems (both separable and non-separable) from data. To address the limitations of existing structure-preserving methods (e.g., implicit symplectic integrators restricted to separable systems or explicit approximations requiring high computational costs), PSNN integrates an explicit pseudo-symplectic integrator as its dynamical core, achieving nearly exact symplecticity with minimal structural error. Additionally, the authors propose learnable Pad\'e-type activation functions based on Pad\'e approximation theory, which empirically outperform classical ReLU, Taylor-based activations, and PAU. By combining these innovations, PSNN demonstrates superior performance in learning and forecasting diverse Hamiltonian systems (e.g., 2D modified pendulum, 4D galactic dynamics), surpassing state-of-the-art models in accuracy, long-term stability, and energy preservation, while requiring shorter training time, fewer samples, and reduced parameters. This framework bridges the gap between computational efficiency and geometric structure preservation in Hamiltonian system modeling.</description>

      <title>On the relation between two Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind and further improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind were proposed independently by Stenger and Rashidinia--Zarebnia, but the relation between the two has yet to be revealed. By theoretical analysis, this paper shows that the solutions of those two methods are not generally equivalent, although they match up at the collocation points. Strictly speaking, Stenger's method assumes that the kernel of the integral is a function of single variable, but this paper theoretically justifies the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a function of two variables. Then, it is rigorously proved that both methods can attain root-exponential convergence. In addition to the contribution, this paper improves Stenger's method so that much higher, almost exponential convergence can be attained. Numerical examples which support the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

      <title>Discrete Superconvergence Analysis for Quantum Magnus Algorithms of Unbounded Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by various applications, unbounded Hamiltonian simulation has recently garnered great attention. Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both. This approach may have broader applications in numerical analysis beyond the specific context of this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite trigonometric Fourier series on a set of discrete equidistant points are considered. A finite system of orthogonal functions that have interpolation and certain differential properties on the period is introduced. Finite Fourier series based on this system of functions form a class of trigonometric splines, which includes polynomial periodic simple splines. Trigonometric splines suggest generalizations in several directions and certainly require further research.</description>

Abstract: We propose rigorous lower and upper bounds for a PINN approximation to PDEs by efficiently computing the Riesz representations of suitable extension and restrictions of the PINN residual towards geometrically simpler domains, which are either embedded or enveloping the original domain. Error bounds are proven and detailed for elliptic as well as parabolic problems. Numerical experiments show the good quantitative behaviour of the derived upper and lower error bounds.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</description>

      <title>A systematic literature review on the application of analytical approaches and mathematical programming in public bus transit network design and operations planning: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among all public transit modes, bus transit systems stand out as the most prevalent and popular. This prominence has spurred a significant body of research addressing various aspects of bus systems. In the literature, analytical approaches and mathematical programming are predominantly used to explore the Public Bus Transit Network Design Problem and Operations Planning (PBTNDP&amp;OP). Part I of our study presented statistical analyses of literature applying these methodologies to PBTNDP&amp;OP, along with a comprehensive review of analytical papers, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. In Part II, we delve into the applications of mathematical programming within PBTNDP&amp;OP, building upon the 15 major sub-categories identified in Part I. We have critically analyzed the identified papers within these sub-categories from various perspectives, including the problems investigated, modeling methods employed, decision variables, network structures, and key findings. This critical review highlights selected papers in each category. Finally, acknowledging existing research gaps, we propose potential extensions for future research. Despite the extensive array of publications, numerous topics still warrant further exploration. Notably, sustainable PBTNDP&amp;OP and challenges associated with integrating emerging technologies are poised to dominate future research agendas.</description>

      <title>Multiscale numerical methods for isothermal fluid models of confined plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to introduce a numerical method to cope with the multiscale nature of confined plasma physics. These investigations are focused on fluid plasma description under large magnetic field. The difficulties in this context stem from intense magnetization of the plasma, inducing a severe anisotropy, possible quasi-neutrality breakdowns, which may occur locally in the plasma and, eventually, the drift regime which prevails for the description of the electrons. These characteristics bring small parameters compared to the scale of the studied device. This work is therefore devoted to highlighting the difficulties specific to this context and to developing numerical methods efficient to cope with this multiscale nature of the physics within the framework of asymptotic-preserving methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical shape and topology optimization of regions supporting the boundary conditions of a physical problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with a particular class of shape and topology optimization problems: the optimized design is a region $G$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of a given domain $\Omega$, which supports a particular type of boundary conditions in the considered physical problem. In our analyses, we develop adapted versions of the notions of shape and topological derivatives, which are classically tailored to functions of a ``bulk'' domain. This leads to two complementary notions of derivatives for a quantity of interest $J(G)$ depending on a region $G \subset \partial \Omega$: on the one hand, we elaborate on the boundary variation method of Hadamard for evaluating the sensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to ``small'' perturbations of the boundary of $G$ within $\partial \Omega$. On the other hand, we use techniques from asymptotic analysis to appraise the sensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to the addition of a new connected component to the region $G$, shaped as a ``small'' surface disk. The calculation of both types of derivatives raises original difficulties, which are carefully detailed in a simple mathematical setting based on the conductivity equation. We notably propose formal arguments to calculate our derivatives with a minimum amount of technicality, and show how they can be generalized to handle more intricate problems, arising for instance in the contexts of acoustics and structural mechanics, respectively governed by the Helmholtz and linear elasticity equations. In numerical applications, our derivatives are incorporated into a recent algorithmic framework for tracking arbitrarily dramatic motions of a region $G$ within a fixed ambient surface, which combines the level set method with remeshing techniques to offer a clear, body-fitted discretization of the evolving region. Finally, various 3d numerical examples are presented to illustrate the salient features of our analysis.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity Multiphysics Modelling for Rapid Predictions Using Physics-informed Parallel Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling complex multiphysics systems governed by nonlinear and strongly coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone in computational science and engineering. However, it remains a formidable challenge for traditional numerical solvers due to high computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. Neural operators' reliance on data-driven training limits their applicability in real-world scenarios, as data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a novel paradigm, physics-informed parallel neural operator (PIPNO), a scalable and unsupervised learning framework that enables data-free PDE modelling by leveraging only governing physical laws. The parallel kernel integration design, incorporating ensemble learning, significantly enhances both compatibility and computational efficiency, enabling scalable operator learning for nonlinear and strongly coupled PDEs. PIPNO efficiently captures nonlinear operator mappings across diverse physics, including geotechnical engineering, material science, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics. The proposed method achieves high-fidelity and rapid predictions, outperforming existing operator learning approaches in modelling nonlinear and strongly coupled multiphysics systems. Therefore, PIPNO offers a powerful alternative to conventional solvers, broadening the applicability of neural operators for multiphysics modelling while ensuring efficiency, robustness, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the numerical solution of an elastic/viscoelastic wave equation with non smooth wave speed and internal localized distributed Kelvin-Voigt damping acting faraway from the boundary. Our method is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and we are interested in deriving the stability estimates and the convergence of the numerical solution to the continuous one. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical study on the decay rate of the solution to the null one when a localized damping acts.</description>

      <title>Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</description>

      <title>Regional climate projections using a deep learning--based model-ranking and downscaling framework: Application to European climate zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate regional climate forecast calls for high-resolution downscaling of Global Climate Models (GCMs). This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\"oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20\% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</description>

      <title>Fast $\ell_1$-Regularized EEG Source Localization Using Variable Projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalograms (EEG) are invaluable for treating neurological disorders, however, mapping EEG electrode readings to brain activity requires solving a challenging inverse problem. Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Impilict Runge-Kutta based sparse identification of governing equations in biologically motivated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying governing equations in physical and biological systems from datasets remains a long-standing challenge across various scientific disciplines, providing mechanistic insights into complex system evolution. Common methods like sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) often rely on precise derivative estimations, making them vulnerable to data scarcity and noise. This study presents a novel data-driven framework by integrating high order implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRKs) with the sparse identification, termed IRK-SINDy. The framework exhibits remarkable robustness to data scarcity and noise by leveraging the lower stepsize constraint of IRKs. Two methods for incorporating IRKs into sparse regression are introduced: one employs iterative schemes for numerically solving nonlinear algebraic system of equations, while the other utilizes deep neural networks to predict stage values of IRKs. The performance of IRK-SINDy is demonstrated through numerical experiments on benchmark problems with varied dynamical behaviors, including linear and nonlinear oscillators, the Lorenz system, and biologically relevant models like predator-prey dynamics, logistic growth, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Results indicate that IRK-SINDy outperforms conventional SINDy and the RK4-SINDy framework, particularly under conditions of extreme data scarcity and noise, yielding interpretable and generalizable models.</description>

Abstract: We proved convergence rates of fully discrete multi-level simultaneous linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs on bounded polygonal domain with log-normal random inputs based on a finite number of their values at points in the spatial-parametric domain. These convergence rates significantly improve the best-known convergence rates of fully discrete collocation approximation and with some logarithm factors coincide with the convergence rates of best $n$-term approximation. These results are obtained as consequences of general results on multi-level linear sampling recovery by extended least squares algorithms in abstract Bochner spaces.</description>

Abstract: The central-upwind weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme introduces the downwind substencil to reconstruct the numerical flux, where the smoothness indicator for the downwind substencil is of critical importance in maintaining high order in smooth regions and preserving the essentially nonoscillatory behavior in shock capturing. In this study, we design the smoothness indicator for the downwind substencil by simply summing up all local smoothness indicators and taking the average, which includes the regularity information of the whole stencil. Accordingly the JS-type and Z-type nonlinear weights, based on simple local smoothness indicators, are developed for the fourth-order central-upwind WENO scheme. The accuracy, robustness, and high-resolution properties of our proposed schemes are demonstrated in a variety of one- and two-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Accurate Fine-Tuning of Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time. To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex. Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions.

      <title>Cubic regularized subspace Newton for non-convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization problem of minimizing non-convex continuous functions, which is relevant in the context of high-dimensional machine learning applications characterized by over-parametrization. We analyze a randomized coordinate second-order method named SSCN which can be interpreted as applying cubic regularization in random subspaces. This approach effectively reduces the computational complexity associated with utilizing second-order information, rendering it applicable in higher-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for non-convex functions, with interpolating rates for arbitrary subspace sizes and allowing inexact curvature estimation. When increasing subspace size, our complexity matches $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ of the cubic regularization (CR) rate. Additionally, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme ensuring exact convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2}, \epsilon^{-3})$ to a second-order stationary point, even without sampling all coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate substantial speed-ups achieved by SSCN compared to conventional first-order methods.</description>

      <title>Back-Projection Diffusion: Solving the Wideband Inverse Scattering Problem with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Wideband Back-Projection Diffusion, an end-to-end probabilistic framework for approximating the posterior distribution of the refractive index using the wideband scattering data through the inverse scattering map. This framework produces highly accurate reconstructions, leveraging conditional diffusion models to draw samples, and also honors the symmetries of the underlying physics of wave-propagation. The procedure is factored into two steps, with the first, inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula, transforms data into a physics-based latent representation, while the second learns a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps individually obey their associated symmetries and are amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. Empirically, our framework has both low sample and computational complexity, with its number of parameters scaling only sub-linearly with the target resolution, and has stable training dynamics. It provides sharp reconstructions effortlessly and is capable of recovering even sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime.</description>
