      <title>AdS4/CFT3 : ABJM Theory, Brane Geometry, Correlators and Mellin Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the $AdS_4/CFT_3$ correspondence (M-theory on $AdS_4 \times S^7 / \mathbb{Z}_k$ $\leftrightarrow$ ABJM theory) in a comprehensive and detailed manner. The ABJM theory i.e. $\mathcal{N} = 6$ $U(N)_k \times U(N)_{-k}$ Chern-Simons matter theory, is presented in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superspace, with explicit demonstration of R-symmetry invariance. The associated brane configuration in type IIB string theory is examined, and the low-energy effective field content is shown to align with that of the ABJM theory, by considering string modes and boundary conditions in a new intuitive perspective on brane intersection boundaries and staged compactification. The consequent lift to M-theory, along with the resulting geometry and its Killing spinors in 11D supergravity, is thoroughly analyzed. The $AdS_4/CFT_3$ statement is then articulated, and its implications are explored, with a focus on the computational machinery of Witten diagrams, first in position space and subsequently in the more convenient Mellin space. The thesis culminates with the computation of the four-point function of the stress-tensor multiplet superconformal primary, incorporating contributions from additional short multiplets involving Spin-3 and Spin-4 exchanges not previously considered in the literature. These computations hold significant practical implications for the M-theory S-matrix. As an overall remark, the streamlined nature of this comprehensive work also aims to inspire fresh insights from $AdS_4/CFT_3$, a duality that probes the non-perturbative aspects of M-theory; a theory that, if it exists, is a promising candidate for the theory of everything, yet remains shrouded in Mystery with much still unknown.</description>

      <title>Surface Kinematics and "The" Yang-Mills Integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to define a canonical loop integrand for non-supersymmetric gluon scattering amplitudes in the planar limit. Naive integrands are inflicted with $1/0$ ambiguities associated with tadpoles and massless external bubbles, which destroy integrand-level gauge invariance as well as consistent on-shell factorization on single loop-cuts. In this letter, we show that this essentially kinematical obstruction to defining "the" integrand for Yang-Mills theory has a structural solution, handed to us by the formulation of gluon amplitudes in terms of curves on surfaces. This defines "surface kinematics" generalizing momenta, making it possible to define "the" integrand satisfying both a (surface generalized) notion of gauge-invariance and consistent loop-cuts. The integrand also vanishes at infinity in appropriate directions, allowing it to be recursively computed for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in any number of dimensions. We illustrate these ideas through one loop for all multiplicity, and for the simplest two-loop integrand.</description>

      <title>Constructing Conformal Double Field Theory through a Double Copy Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the classical Double Copy (DC) procedure that links Yang-Mills and Double Field Theory (DFT), and we apply it on a four-derivative gauge theory which is known to be related to Weyl gravity at the level of the amplitudes. We obtain a perturbative T-duality invariant theory on a double geometry, or Conformal Double Field Theory (CDFT), incorporating Weyl gravity plus $b$-field and dilaton contributions at quadratic order, without the need to impose a gauge fixing condition. We also extend the formulation to cubic order for the case of vanishing generalized dilaton, which still incorporates Weyl gravity when $\Box h_{\mu \nu}=h=0$. CDFT, together with ordinary DFT, are examples of T-duality invariant theories constructed through classical DC maps, revealing a promising and deep connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant models.</description>

      <title>Abelian Anyons on Flux-Quantized M5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fractional quantum Hall systems provide the best experimental evidence yet of (abelian) anyons plausibly necessary for future fault-tolerant quantum computation, like all strongly-coupled quantum systems their physics is not deeply understood. However, generally a promising approach is to (holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and specifically an old argument by Hellerman &amp; Susskind gives a sketch of fractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of M5/M9-brane intersections.
  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on M5$\perp$MO9-branes ("open M5-branes") on the discrete light cone, after globally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume via a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity, specifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology ("Hypothesis H").
  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy moduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and identifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under topological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the regularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Rank-$N$ Dimer Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The web trace theorem of Douglas, Kenyon, Shi expands the twisted Kasteleyn determinant in terms of traces of webs. We generalize this theorem to higher genus surfaces and expand the twisted Kasteleyn matrices corresponding to spin structures on the surface, analogously to the rank-1 case of Cimasoni, Reshetikhin. In the process of the proof, we give an alternate geometric derivation of the planar web trace theorem, relying on the spin geometry of embedded loops and a `racetrack construction' used to immerse loops in the blowup graph on the surface.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry breaking in SYK and the black hole spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum and dynamics of near-extremal black holes are strongly modified by quantum effects at low temperatures. When the extremal limit does not preserve any supersymmetry, the density of states goes to zero at extremality and no extremal black holes remain. However, when the extremal limit is supersymmetric, a large microscopic degeneracy survives and there is a gap to the first excited black hole visible from gravity. In this article we study large $N$ quantum mechanical models where supersymmetry is explicitly broken, allowing us to interpolate between these two qualitatively different pictures. We propose and analyze deformations of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with such a pattern of (super)symmetry breaking which violates the $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry. These models feature a lifting of the BPS degeneracy and a closing of the spectral gap, and we further show that the large $N$ soft effective action is given by a modification of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ Schwarzian theory in which the $U(1)_R$ mode becomes massive.</description>

      <title>On the infrared limit of the O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$-model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D nonlinear sigma models with Hermitian symmetric target admit a theta-term, which couples the field theory to the topological charge of its instanton gas. At the special coupling theta = pi, by what is nowadays attributed to a coupling-constant anomaly of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type, such models have a degenerate ground state. Yet, the details of their non-trivial infrared limit have remained open in general. Here we suggest that non-perturbative renormalization group flow into the strong-coupling regime induces strong fluctuations of the theta-parameter, with the consequence that the instanton density is suppressed, the target-space topology effectively altered, and the target-space metric driven off reality and into geometrostasis. Assuming this heuristic scenario and combining it with a Cauchy process of target-space deformation, we present a detailed argument that the O(3) nonlinear sigma model at theta = pi, known to be the effective field theory for critical antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains with large half-integer spin, renormalizes to the conformal field theory of a U(1) boson compactified at a special radius with SU(2) symmetry. A closely related scenario applies to Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model for the integer quantum Hall transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of false vacuum decay induced by spherical seeds. The type of seed considered has a boundary characterised by surface energy terms. The theory applies to false vacuum decay at zero and finite temperatures. Seeded nucleation may be important for enabling future false vacuum decay experiments on analogue systems using Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC). We show that our theory of seeded nucleation at finite temperature applied to a potassium BEC in two spatial dimensions agrees with numerical, real-time, simulations.</description>

Abstract: We systematically compute five-point correlators of chiral primary operators with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein charges at tree-level in $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times\mathrm{S}^3$, and obtain a unified formula. This result serves as the first concrete confirmation for the existence of the hidden eight-dimensional symmetries at the level of five points.</description>

      <title>Emergent potentials and non-perturbative open topological strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that integrating out M2 branes ending on M5 branes inside Calabi-Yau manifolds captures non-perturbative open topological string physics. The integrating out is performed using a contour integral in complexified Schwinger proper time. For the resolved conifold, this contour can be extended to include the zero pole, which we argue captures the ultraviolet completion of the integrating out and yields the tree-level polynomial terms in the free energy. This is a manifestation of the Emergence Proposal, and provides further evidence for it. Unlike the case of closed strings, where the emergent terms are kinetic terms in the action, for these open strings it is tree-level potential terms which are emergent. This provides a first quantitative example of the proposal that classical tree-level potentials in string theory emerge from integrating out co-dimension one states.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a generalized Stephanov model for finite-density QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a random matrix model for QCD at finite chemical potential, obtained by generalizing the Stephanov model by modifying the random-matrix integration measure with a one-parameter trace deformation. This allows one to check how important the integration measure is for the qualitative features of random matrix models, as well as to test the robustness and universality of the qualitative picture of the original model. While for a small trace deformation the phase diagram is identical to that of the Stephanov model, for a large deformation an exotic phase with spontaneous charge-conjugation breaking appears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the pole-skipping structure in de Sitter (dS) spacetime and find that their leading frequencies satisfy the relation $\omega_{dS}=i2\pi T_{dS}(1-s)$ with $T_{dS}$ denotes $T_{dS}=1/2\pi L$ and $s$ spin. The positions of pole-skipping in the two-dimensional dS spacetime for the scalar field of spin-0 and the fermionic field of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ correspond one-to-one with those in the infinite temperature limit of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK$_\infty$). The Green's functions of these two systems have similar forms at the pole-skipping points. This provides a numerical correspondence for the duality between dS$_2$ and the DSSYK$_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Rotating Charged Nariai Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr-Newman black holes in a de Sitter space have the limit of rotating Nariai black holes with the near-horizon geometry of a warped ${\rm dS}_3 \times {\rm S}^1/Z_2$ when the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon coincide or approach close to each other. We study the effect of rotation on the emission of charges in the near-extremal rotating charged Nariai black hole and compare it to those from the near-extremal Nariai black hole and near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in de Sitter space. The emission has an exponential amplification for charges with high energy and becomes catastrophic when the two horizons are very close to each together. The angular momentum of black holes decreases the mean number of charges by a factor not by an order. We observe a catastrophic emission of boson condensation for charges with the effective energy equal to the chemical potential in the spacelike outer region of the cosmological horizon. Further, the rotating charged Nariai black holes can evolve into singular spacetimes with a naked singularity by the Schwinger pair production.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Resolution of Strong Coupling Singularities in 4d N=1 Heterotic/M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of the moduli space of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories of gravity arising from compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string on Calabi-Yau threefolds. By studying the threshold corrections to the coupling of the heterotic gauge groups, we infer the existence of a strong coupling singularity for one of the perturbative heterotic gauge groups, which effectively yields an additional finite distance boundary of the classical scalar field space. In heterotic M-theory, this boundary maps to a domain wall solution for which the gauge coupling and the warp factor on one of the Horava-Witten 9-branes diverge, thus highlighting the gravitational origin of the classical strong coupling singularity. The divergence of the warp factor is, however, regulated once non-perturbative effects are taken into account, as we demonstrate by studying the instanton corrections to the 5d BPS domain wall equations. This regularization implies that the classical strong coupling boundary of the scalar field 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ heterotic/M-theory is resolved, indicating that, at the quantum level, the field space can be extended beyond this classical boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the width of the scattering cross-section is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the scattering cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. The validity of this result arises from the fact that the bulk dual of entanglement entropy and the string vertices both are intrinsic hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate braneworld models generated by scalar fields in which one field has a split kink profile, in which a kink separates into two kinklike configurations. Our analysis covers models with two and three fields, examining the behavior of the most important quantities associated with the brane, such as the warp factor and the stability of the corresponding gravity sector. The results show that the brane is stable and supports a hybrid character, behaving as a thin and thick configuration.</description>

      <title>Cornering Relative Symmetry Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry data of a $d$-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) can often be captured in terms of a higher-dimensional symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). In top down (i.e., stringy) realizations of this structure, the QFT in question is localized in a higher-dimensional bulk. In many cases of interest, however, the associated $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk is not fully gapped and one must instead consider a filtration of theories to reach a gapped bulk in $D = d+m$ dimensions. Overall, this leads us to a nested structure of relative symmetry theories which descend to coupled edge modes, with the original QFT degrees of freedom localized at a corner of this $D$-dimensional bulk system. We present a bottom up characterization of this structure and also show how it naturally arises in a number of string-based constructions of QFTs with both finite and continuous symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic Hamiltonians for multimode bosonic systems results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those seen in chaotic systems. Specifically, considering initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in entanglement dynamics and the negative value of tripartite mutual information. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, we find that the spectral form factor exhibits a non-linear ramp and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display a power law growth. These results show that information scrambling, associated with randomness, is a distinct feature from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states of continuous-variable systems that are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong charge-parity (CP) problem has been a long-standing problem in particle physics since 1976, illustrating the small CP-violation phase in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The axion, based on the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, is the most popular solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution based on the three-zero texture of quark mass matrices without additional heavy quark states, which has been shown to fit data well. We show that the required three-zero texture is naturally constructed in a six-dimensional spacetime with a $\mathbf{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold compactification.</description>

Abstract: We investigate compact stars in the noninteger power (NIP) model of $f(R)$ gravity theory, which includes the higher-curvature correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The mass-radius relation of the compact stars in the NIP model predicts large deviations from those in the general relativity in the low-mass region, potentially allowing us to test the NIP model by future astrophysical observations. We also study the nonvanishing scalar hair surrounding the compact star and demonstrate that the chameleon mechanism works efficiently. They result in distinct scalar profiles inside and outside the star, which implies screening the fifth force mediated by the scalar field.</description>

      <title>Timelike virtual transition in a static atom by a static mirror in Kasner Universe and in future Kruskal-Szekeres region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the Kasner regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the Kasner spacetime, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using future Kasner time, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time and the mirror is following the future Kasner time. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror is using future Kruskal time while the static atom is using Schwarzschild timelike coordinate, defined inside the black hole, as its time, and vice-versa. In all of these scenarios, we observe thermal response and its periodic dependence on the separation between the atom and the mirror. These responses vanish periodically with this separation, which contrasts the scenario of uniform acceleration. We observe that the $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner responses are the same when the atomic and field frequencies are equal. At the same time, the Schwarzschild-interior and $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner are unequal for the same atomic and field frequencies. Therefore we feel that the robustness of the symmetry between the two scenarios crucially depends on the dimension as well as the curvature of the spacetime. Although qualitatively, there exist similarities to a certain degree between the responses in the Minkowski-Kasner and Schwarzschild-interior, they also carry crucial differences. We discuss the physical interpretations of these observations.</description>

      <title>If Mixed States Are Secretly Quickly Oscillating Pure States, Weak Measurements Can Detect It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent nonunitary evolution in the black hole information paradox and recent work on describing wavefunction collapse via nonunitary nonlinear stochastic operators has motivated us to analyze whether mixed states can be distinguished from quickly oscillating pure states. We have demonstrated that the answer is no for all practical purposes if only strong nonpostselected measurements are performed. However, if weak measurements in postselected systems are used, mixed states and quickly oscillating states produce different results. An experimental procedure is proposed which could in principle determine the nature of mixed states stemming from blackbody radiation, decoherence, thermalization in solid state materials, Unruh radiation and Hawking radiation, among others. The analysis in this work applies to all fast oscillations, including those at Planck scale. As such, tabletop weak measurements can be used to probe (very specific) potential high energy behavior, where strong nonpostselected measurements cannot be applied. This work also demonstrates that weak measurements are not equivalent to a set of strong measurements without postselection since measurements which are impossible for all practical purposes need to be excluded.</description>

      <title>Thermal and non-thermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

Abstract: Explicit constructions for the minimal models of general and unimodular L-infinity algebra structures are given using the BV-formalism of mathematical physics and the perturbative expansions of integrals. In particular, the general formulas for the minimal model of an L-infinity algebra structure are an instance of the Homotopy Transfer Theorem and we recover the known formulas of the structure in terms of sums over rooted trees discussing their relation to Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multipartite entanglement after quenches from initial states which generate multiplets of quasiparticle excitations beyond the usual pair structure. We focus on the dynamics of tripartite entanglement through the lens of the Markov gap -- a computable quantity that signals irreducible tripartite entanglement when positive. In the XX spin chain, we show that the Markov gap is positive at intermediate times, implying the presence of tripartite entanglement. After a time delay, the Markov gap increases and then decays at longer times, thus exhibiting an entanglement barrier. We argue that those qualitative features are consistent with an interpretation of the spreading of tripartite entanglement by triplets of tripartite-entangled quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum improvement of Kerr black holes with mass-dependent scale identifications in asymptotically safe gravity. We find that a physically sensible identification can only be a function of $Mr$ and the area $A=4\pi(r^2+a^2)$ where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $a$ is an angular momentum parameter. We then discuss various properties of the rotating quantum black holes for a simple choice of the identification. We show that the resulting regular rotating black holes have the following nice properties: (i) admitting a consistent black hole thermodynamics at the horizon, (ii) resolving the ring singularity, (iii) partially eliminating closed time-like curves present in the classical Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Effect of backreaction on Island, Page curve and Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation in a bath attached to a deformed eternal AdS black hole. This black hole is dual to the two identical strongly coupled large-$N_c$ thermal field theories, where each theory is backreacted (deformed) by the presence of a uniform static distribution of heavy fundamental quarks. In our observation we find that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases in a quadratic manner for an early time and linearly for the late time. The large time expression for the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is used to find the Page curve and Page time. After the Page time, the entanglement entropy saturates to a constant value due to the appearance of an island. We observe that introducing deformation (backreaction) delays the appearance of island and shifts the Page curve to a later time. Subsequently, the computation of the scrambling time reveals an increase with the backreaction parameter, suggesting a longer duration for information retrieval in the presence of deformation. Moreover, our analysis of the mutual information between the radiation subsystems shows that it vanishes at a critical time which increases with the deformation before the Page time. After the Page time, the appearance of island leads to the vanishing of mutual information between black hole subsystems and gives the time difference of the order of scrambling time.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by conjectures about near-horizon dynamics in quantum gravity, we search for lines of perturbatively accessible fixed points emanating from models of $N$ free fermions. Through two loops we find a new class of models, apart from the well-known Abelian Thirring models. Further study is needed to see whether these can lead to true conformal manifolds, or perhaps a new class of large N fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new splitting behavior of tree-level string/particle amplitudes for scalars, gluons and gravitons. We identify certain subspaces in the space of Mandelstam variables, where the universal Koba-Nielsen factor splits into two parts (each with an off-shell leg). Both open- and closed-string amplitudes with Parke-Taylor factors naturally factorize into two stringy ${\it currents}$, which implies the splitting of bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ amplitudes and via a simple deformation to unified stringy amplitudes, the splitting of amplitudes in the non-linear sigma model and Yang-Mills-scalar theory; the same splitting holds for scalar amplitudes without color such as the special Galileon. Remarkably, if we impose similar constraints on Lorentz products involving polarizations, gluon and graviton amplitudes in bosonic string and superstring theories also split into two (stringy) currents. A special case of the splitting implies soft theorems, and more generally it extends recently proposed smooth splittings and new factorizations near zeros to all these theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying that the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative phenomena, with surprising late-time features.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto equation from three-dimensional gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral forms in the Sen formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sen formulation for chiral $(2p)$-form in $4p+2$ dimensions describes a system with two separate sectors, one is physical while the other is unphysical. Each contains a chiral form and a metric. In this paper, we focus on the cases where the self-duality condition for the unphysical sector is linear while for the physical sector can be nonlinear. We show the decoupling at the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian levels. The decoupling at the Hamiltonian level follows the idea in the literature. Then by an appropriate field redefinition of the corresponding first-order Lagrangian, the separation at the Lagrangian level follows. We derive the diffeomorphism of the theory in the case where the chiral form in the physical sector has nonlinear self-dual field strength and couples to external $(2p+1)$-form field. Explicit forms of Sen theories are also discussed. The Lagrangian for the quadratic theory is separated into two Henneaux-Teitelboim Lagrangians. We also discuss the method of generating explicit nonlinear theories with $p=1$. Finally, we also show that the M5-brane action in the Sen formulation is separated into a Henneaux-Teitelboim action in unphysical sector and a gauge-fixed PST in physical sector.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Assisted Metropolis-Hastings for Bayesian Estimation of Critical Exponent on Elliptic Black Hole Solution in 4D Using Quantum Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the critical gravitational collapse produces continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine the solutions in the domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We develop a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on quantum perturbation theory to find the distribution of the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solution and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein discreteness of the entropy: Symmetrical bath and CFT subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement entropy of CFT systems in contact with large bath system, such that the complete system lives on the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$ spacetime. We are interested in finding the HEE of a bath (system-B) in contact with a central subsystem-A. We assume that the net size of systems A and B together remains fixed while allowing variation in individual sizes. This assumption is simply guided by the conservation laws. It is found that for large bath size the island entropy term are important. However other subleading (icebergs) terms do also contribute to bath entropy. The contributions are generally not separable from each other and all such contributions add together to give rise a fixed quantity. Further when accounted properly all such contributions will form part of higher entropy branch for the bath. Nevertheless the HEE of bath system should be subjected to minimality principle. The quantum minimality principle $ S_{quantum}[B]=\{S[A], S_{total}+S[A]\}_{min}$, is local in nature and gives rise to the Page curve. It is shown that the changes in bath entropy do capture Kaluza-Klein discreteness. The minimality principle would be applicable in finite temperature systems as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Large Landscape of 4d Superconformal Field Theories from Small Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically explore the space of renormalization group flows of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) triggered by relevant deformations, as well as by coupling to free chiral multiplets with relevant operators. In this way, we classify all possible fixed point SCFTs that can be obtained from certain rank 1 and 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with small amount of matter multiplets, identifying 7,346 inequivalent fixed points which pass a series of non-trivial consistency checks. This set of fixed points exhibits interesting statistical behaviors, including a narrow distribution of central charges $(a, c)$, a correlation between the number of relevant operators and the ratio $a/c$, and trends in the lightest operator dimension versus $a/c$. The ratio $a/c$ of this set is distributed between $0.7228$ and $1.2100$, where the upper bound is larger than that of previously known interacting SCFTs. Moreover, we find a plethora of highly non-perturbative phenomena, such as (super)symmetry enhancements, operator decoupling, non-commuting renormalization group flows, and dualities. We especially identify amongst these fixed points a new SCFT that has smaller central charges $(a, c) = (\frac{633}{2000},\frac{683}{2000})$ than that of the deformed minimal Argyres-Douglas theory, as well as novel Lagrangian duals for certain $\mathcal{N}=1$ deformed Argyres-Douglas theories. We provide a website https://qft.kaist.ac.kr/landscape to navigate through our set of fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correlators of three single-trace operators in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the perspective of integrable boundary states. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where two operators being $1/3$-BPS and the entire correlation function is considered within the twisted-translated frame. The correlator can be expressed as the overlap between a boundary state and a Bethe state. It is found that the boundary state formed by the two $1/3$-BPS operators is integrable only when the number of Wick contractions between the non-BPS operator and one of the $1/3$-BPS operators is 0 or 1. We compute the overlaps for the integrable cases utilizing the symmetries preserved by the correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the physical meaning of modular invariance for unitary conformal quantum field theories in d=2. For QFT models, while T invariance is necessary for locality, S invariance is not mandatory. S invariance is a form of completeness of the theory that has a precise meaning as Haag duality for arbitrary multi-interval regions. We present a mathematical proof as well as derive this result from a physical standpoint using Renyi entropies and the replica trick. For rational CFT's, the failure of modular invariance or Haag duality can be measured by an index, related to the quantum dimensions of the model. We show how to compute this index from the modular transformation matrices. The index also appears in a limit of the Renyi mutual informations. Cases of infinite index are briefly discussed. Part of the argument can be extended to higher dimensions, where the lack of completeness can also be diagnosed using the CFT data through the thermal partition function and measured by an index.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show that tree-level MHV $n$-graviton amplitudes, when analytically continued to Klein space, can be holographically generated as the correlators of a two-dimensional conformal field theory ($2d$ CFT) in the large-$N$ semiclassical $b\rightarrow0$ limit. This $2d$ CFT is composed of a Liouville field theory, coupled to a level-one $SO\left(N\right)$ Kac-Moody current, and a doublet of free fermions residing on $\mathbf{CP}^{1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Shakirov's non-stationary difference equation, when it is truncated, implies the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$-KZ) equation for $U_{\mathsf v}\bigl(A_1^{(1)}\bigr)$ with generic spins. Namely, we can tune mass parameters so that the Hamiltonian acts on the space of finite Laurent polynomials. Then the representation matrix of the Hamiltonian agrees with the $R$-matrix, or the quantum $6j$ symbols. On the other hand, we prove that the $K$ theoretic Nekrasov partition function from the affine Laumon space is identified with the well-studied Jackson integral solution to the $q$-KZ equation. Combining these results, we establish that the affine Laumon partition function gives a solution to Shakirov's equation, which was a conjecture in our previous paper. We also work out the base-fiber duality and four-dimensional limit in relation with the $q$-KZ equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical description to relate the universal term to the effective ground-state degeneracy known as the $g$ function in a boundary conformal field theory, and use the renormalization group method to determine its value. We show that the universal contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement. Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no postselections, is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>
