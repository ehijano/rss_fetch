      <title>Linear-Time $(1+\varepsilon)$-Approximation Algorithms for Two-Line-Center Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane, we study the two-line-center problem: finding two lines that minimize the maximum distance from each point in $S$ to its closest line. We present a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the two-line-center problem that runs in $O((n/\varepsilon) \log (1/\varepsilon))$ time, which improves the previously best $O(n\log n + ({n}/{\varepsilon^2}) \log ({1}/{\varepsilon}) + (1/\varepsilon^3)\log ({1}/{\varepsilon}))$-time algorithm. We also consider three variants of this problem, in which the orientations of the two lines are restricted: (1) the orientation of one of the two lines is fixed, (2) the orientations of both lines are fixed, and (3) the two lines are required to be parallel. For each of these three variants, we give the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm that runs in linear time. In particular, for the variant where the orientation of one of the two lines is fixed, we also give an improved exact algorithm that runs in $O(n \log n)$ time and show that it is optimal.</description>

      <title>Computing the Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation of a Closed Polyhedral Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every surface that is intrinsically polyhedral can be represented by a portalgon: a collection of polygons in the Euclidean plane with some pairs of equally long edges abstractly identified. While this representation is arguably simpler than meshes (flat polygons in R3 forming a surface), it has unbounded happiness: a shortest path in the surface may visit the same polygon arbitrarily many times. This pathological behavior is an obstacle towards efficient algorithms. On the other hand, L\"offler, Ophelders, Staals, and Silveira (SoCG 2023) recently proved that the (intrinsic) Delaunay triangulations have bounded happiness.
  In this paper, given a closed polyhedral surface S, represented by a triangular portalgon T, we provide an algorithm to compute the Delaunay triangulation of S whose vertices are the singularities of S (the points whose surrounding angle is distinct from 2pi). The time complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of triangles and in the logarithm of the aspect ratio r of T. Within our model of computation, we show that the dependency in log(r) is unavoidable. Our algorithm can be used to pre-process a triangular portalgon before computing shortest paths on its surface, and to determine whether the surfaces of two triangular portalgons are isometric.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for the Shrinking Wellness Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well groups were introduced by Edelsbrunner, Morozov, and Patel to measure the robustness of geometric features of a function with respect to perturbations. Roughly speaking, the $r$-th well group measures the number of features that cannot be removed by perturbing the function by at most $r$. The Shrinking Wellness Lemma states that the rank of these groups decreases as $r$ increases. In the generality originally stated, it is wrong. We present a counterexample and give conditions under which the result holds. These conditions are general enough to cover most cases in which the well groups have been applied.</description>
