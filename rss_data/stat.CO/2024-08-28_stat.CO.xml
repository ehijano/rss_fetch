      <title>A Bayesian approach for fitting semi-Markov mixture models of cancer latency to individual-level data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-state models of cancer natural history are widely used for designing and evaluating cancer early detection strategies. Calibrating such models against longitudinal data from screened cohorts is challenging, especially when fitting non-Markovian mixture models against individual-level data. Here, we consider a family of semi-Markov mixture models of cancer natural history introduce an efficient data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for fitting these models to individual-level screening and cancer diagnosis histories. Our fully Bayesian approach supports rigorous uncertainty quantification and model selection through leave-one-out cross-validation, and it enables the estimation of screening-related overdiagnosis rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using synthetic data, showing that the sampling algorithm efficiently explores the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and latent variables. Finally, we apply our method to data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and estimate the extent of breast cancer overdiagnosis associated with mammography screening. The sampler and model comparison method are available in the R package baclava.</description>

      <title>An invitation to adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which automatically tune their parameters based on past samples, have proved extremely useful in practice. The self-tuning mechanism makes them `non-Markovian', which means that their validity cannot be ensured by standard Markov chains theory. Several different techniques have been suggested to analyse their theoretical properties, many of which are technically involved. The technical nature of the theory may make the methods unnecessarily unappealing. We discuss one technique -- based on a martingale decomposition -- with uniformly ergodic Markov transitions. We provide an accessible and self-contained treatment in this setting, and give detailed proofs of the results discussed in the paper, which only require basic understanding of martingale theory and general state space Markov chain concepts. We illustrate how our conditions can accomodate different types of adaptation schemes, and can give useful insight to the requirements which ensure their validity.</description>

      <title>stopp: An R Package for Spatio-Temporal Point Pattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: stopp is a novel R package specifically designed for the analysis of spatio-temporal point patterns which might have occurred in a subset of the Euclidean space or on some specific linear network, such as roads of a city. It represents the first package providing a comprehensive modelling framework for spatio-temporal Poisson point processes. While many specialized models exist in the scientific literature for analyzing complex spatio-temporal point patterns, we address the lack of general software for comparing simpler alternative models and their goodness of fit. The package's main functionalities include modelling and diagnostics, together with exploratory analysis tools and the simulation of point processes. A particular focus is given to local first-order and second-order characteristics. The package aggregates existing methods within one coherent framework, including those we proposed in recent papers, and it aims to welcome many further proposals and extensions from the R community.</description>

      <title>kendallknight: An R Package for Efficient Implementation of Kendall's Correlation Coefficient Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kendallknight package introduces an efficient implementation of Kendall's correlation coefficient computation, significantly improving the processing time for large datasets without sacrificing accuracy. The kendallknight package, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the computational complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time, transforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or minutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and errors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall's correlation coefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains over the base R implementation, especially for large datasets.</description>

      <title>Leveraging graphical model techniques to study evolution on phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular and phenotypic traits is commonly modelled using Markov processes along a phylogeny. This phylogeny can be a tree, or a network if it includes reticulations, representing events such as hybridization or admixture. Computing the likelihood of data observed at the leaves is costly as the size and complexity of the phylogeny grows. Efficient algorithms exist for trees, but cannot be applied to networks. We show that a vast array of models for trait evolution along phylogenetic networks can be reformulated as graphical models, for which efficient belief propagation algorithms exist. We provide a brief review of belief propagation on general graphical models, then focus on linear Gaussian models for continuous traits. We show how belief propagation techniques can be applied for exact or approximate (but more scalable) likelihood and gradient calculations, and prove novel results for efficient parameter inference of some models. We highlight the possible fruitful interactions between graphical models and phylogenetic methods. For example, approximate likelihood approaches have the potential to greatly reduce computational costs for phylogenies with reticulations.</description>
