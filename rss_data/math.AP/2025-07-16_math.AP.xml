      <title>A non-Gaussian Hardy-type Equation in Fractional Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-Gaussian Hardy equation is studied with a non-linearity of Osgood-type growth. A fractional derivative in time is incorporated for the first time in an research of this type. Existence of local and global solutions are established by combining properties of the fundamental solutions together with the parameters of the non-Gaussian process, leading to optimal asymptotic estimates. Additional properties of the fundamental solutions and instantaneous blow-up results are found. The Banach contraction mapping principle is particularly exploited. It is also defined a critical exponent for existence and non-existence of solutions together with a judicious choice of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Existence of nested polygonal vortex patches for the generalized SQG equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates time-periodic solutions of both the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation and its generalized form (gSQG) within the more singular regime, focusing on the evolution of patch-type structures. Assuming the underlying point vortex equilibrium satisfies a natural nondegeneracy condition, we employ an implicit function argument to construct families of co-rotating nested polygonal vortex patch solutions. These configurations provide precise asymptotic descriptions of the geometry of the evolving patch boundaries. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of coherent rotating structures arising in active scalar equations with singular velocity coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study qualitative properties of initial traces of solutions to the porous medium equation with power nonlinearity, and obtain necessary conditions for the existence of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we establish sharp sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem using uniformly local Morrey spaces and their variations, and identify the optimal singularities of the initial data for the solvability of the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Least total curvature solutions to steady Euler system and monotone solutions to semilinear equations in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on establishing the existence of a class of steady solutions, termed least total curvature solutions, to the incompressible Euler system in a strip. The solutions obtained in this paper complement the least total curvature solutions already known. Our approach employs a minimization procedure to identify a monotone heteroclinic solution for a conveniently chosen semilinear elliptic PDE. This method also enables us to construct positive and monotone (and consequently stable) solutions to semilinear elliptic PDEs with non-convex superlevel sets in a strip domain. This can be regarded as a negative answer to a generalized problem raised in [27].</description>

      <title>A 2-complex containing Sobolev spaces of matrix fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a generalization of complexes, called 2-complexes, this paper defines and analyzes new Sobolev spaces of matrix fields and their interrelationships within a commuting diagram. These spaces have very weak second-order derivatives. An example is the space of matrix fields of square-integrable components whose row-wise divergence followed by yet another divergence operation yield a function in a standard negative-order Sobolev space. Similar spaces where the double divergence is replaced by a curl composed with divergence, or a double curl operator (the incompatibility operator), are also studied. Stable decompositions of such spaces in terms of more regular component functions (which are continuous in natural norms) are established. Appropriately ordering such Sobolev spaces with and without boundary conditions (in a weak sense), we discover duality relationships between them. Motivation to study such Sobolev spaces, from a finite element perspective and implications for weak well-posed variational formulations are pointed out.</description>

      <title>On the convergence to the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system with solenoidal Ohm's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system with solenoidal Ohm's law can be viewed as as the asymptotic limit of the two-fluid incompressible Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system as the momentum transfer coefficient tends to zero (see [1], Ars\'enio, Ibrahim and Masmoudi, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2015). We prove this limit rigorously without loss of regularity by using the idea of frequency envelope.</description>

      <title>A curvature flow approach to dorsal closure modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study a curvature-based mathematical model for dorsal closure in embryonic drosophila. Using an analysis that mixes maximum-principle and integral-estimates, we establish global existence and convergence for data that mimics the initial geometry of a dorsal closure event. Further, we present a numerical approximation scheme for the flow, establishing stability, consistence, and convergence. We also give sample simulations of the flow with initial configurations that include experimentally observed data.</description>

      <title>Forward and inverse problems for a mixed-type equation with the Caputo fractional derivative and Dezin-type non-local condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the study of a mixed-type partial differential equation involving a Caputo fractional derivative in the time domain $t &gt; 0$ and a classical parabolic equation in the domain $t &lt; 0$, along with Dezin-type non-local boundary and gluing conditions. The forward and inverse problems are studied in detail. For the forward problem, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are established using the Fourier method, under appropriate assumptions on the initial data and the right-hand side. We also analyze the dependency of solvability on the parameter $\lambda$, from the Dezin-type condition. For the inverse problem, where the right-hand side is separable as $F(x,t) = f(x)g(t)$ (the unknown function is $f(x)$), the existence and uniqueness of a solution are proven under a certain condition on the function $g(t)$ (a constant sign is sufficient).</description>

      <title>Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part I: $\Gamma$-convergence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this three-part work is to provide a unified consistent framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture.
  In this first paper we establish the mathematical foundation of a cohesive phase-field model by proving a $\Gamma$-convergence result in a one-dimensional setting. Specifically, we consider a broad class of phase-field energies, encompassing different models present in the literature, thereby both extending the results in \cite{ContiFocardiIurlano2016} and providing an analytical validation of all the other approaches. Additionally, by modifying the functional scaling, we demonstrate that our formulation also generalizes the Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation for brittle fracture, therefore laying the groundwork for a unified framework for variational fracture problems.
  The Part~II paper presents a systematic procedure for constructing phase-field models that reproduce prescribed cohesive laws, whereas the Part~III paper validates the theoretical results with applied examples.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part II: Reconstruction of the cohesive law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper of a three-part work the main aim of which is to provide a unified consistent framework for the phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Building on the theoretical foundations of the first paper, where {$\Gamma$-convergence} results have been derived, this second paper presents a systematic procedure for constructing phase-field models that reproduce prescribed cohesive laws. By either selecting the degradation function and determining the damage potential or vice versa, we enable the derivation of multiple phase-field models that exhibit the same cohesive fracture behavior but differ in their localized phase-field evolution. This methodology provides a flexible and rigorous strategy for tailoring phase-field models to specific cohesive responses, as shown by the several examples worked out. The mechanical responses associated with these examples, highlighting their features and validating the theoretical results, are investigated in the third paper from a more engineering-oriented and applied perspective.</description>

      <title>On a fractional semilinear Neumann problem arising in Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a semilinear and nonlocal Neumann problem, which is the fractional analogue of the problem considered by Lin--Ni--Takagi in the '80s. The model under consideration arises in the description of stationary configurations of the Keller--Segel model for chemotaxis, when a nonlocal diffusion for the concentration of the chemical is considered. In particular, we extend to any fractional power $s\in (0,1)$ of the Laplacian (with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions) the results obtained in [20] for $s=1/2$. We prove existence and some qualitative properties of non--constant solutions when the diffusion parameter $\varepsilon$ is small enough, and on the other hand, we show that for $\varepsilon$ large enough any solution must be necessarily constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive localized and global noncompact versions of Hamilton's gradient estimate
  for positive solutions to the heat equation on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below.
  Our estimates are essentially optimal and significantly improve on all previous estimates of this type.
  As applications, we derive a new
  and sharp, space only, local pseudo-Harnack inequality, as well as estimates of the spatial modulus of continuity of solutions.</description>

      <title>Classification of entire and ancient solutions of the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the diffusive HJ eq. with Dirichlet conditions, which arises in stochastic control as well as in KPZ type models of surface growth. It is known that, for $p&gt;2$ and suitably large, smooth initial data, the sol. undergoes finite time gradient blowup on the boundary. On the other hand, Liouville type rigidity or classif. ppties play a central role in the study of qualitative behavior in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic problems, and notably appear in the famous BCN conjecture about one-dimensionality of solutions in a half-space. With this motivation, we study the Liouville type classif. and symmetry ppties for entire and ancient sol. in $\R^n$ and in a half-space with Dirichlet B.C.
  - First, we show that any ancient sol. in $\R^n$ with sublinear upper growth at infinity is necessarily constant. This result is {\it optimal}, in view of explicit examples and solves a long standing open problem.
  - Next we turn to the half-space problem for $p&gt;2$ and we completely classify entire solutions: any entire sol. is stationary and one-dimensional. The assumption is sharp in view of explicit examples for $p=2$.
  - Then we show that the situation is also completely different for ancient sol. in a half-space: there exist nonstationary ancient sol. for all $p&gt;1$.
  Nevertheless, we show that any ancient sol. is necessarily positive, and that stationarity and one-dimensionality are recovered provided a -- close to optimal -- polynomial growth restriction is imposed on the sol.
  - In addition we establish new and optimal, local estimates of Bernstein and Li-Yau type.
  The proofs of the Liouville and classif. results are delicate, based on integral estimates, a translation-compactness procedure and comparison arguments, combined with our Bernstein and Li-Yau type estimates.</description>

      <title>Mixed local and nonlocal laplacian without standard critical exponent for Lane-Emden equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a mixed elliptic equation involving both local and nonlocal Laplacian operators, with a power-type nonlinearity. Specifically, we consider a Lane-Emden type equation of the form \[-\Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u = u^p,\quad\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^n.\] where the operator combines the classical Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian. We establish the existence of solutions for exponents slightly below the critical local Sobolev exponent, that is, for $p &lt; \frac{n+2}{n-2}$, with $p$ close to $\frac{n+2}{n-2}$.
  Our results show that, due to the interaction between the local and nonlocal operators, this mixed Lane-Emden-Fowler equation does not admit a critical exponent in the traditional sense. The existence proof is carried out using a Lyapunov-Schmidt type reduction method and, as far as we know, provide the first example of an elliptic operator for which the duality between critical exponents fails.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of solutions for a class of wave-Klein-Gordon coupled systems with specific nonlinearities in 3+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The study demonstrates that imposing certain constraints on the coefficients of these specific nonlinear terms induces a damping effect within the system, which is crucial for proving the global existence of solutions. The proof is conducted within the framework of a bootstrap argument, primarily employing the hyperboloidal foliation method and the vector field method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove existence and regularity of weak solutions for the following system
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}

  &amp;u=v=0 \ \mbox{on} \ \partial\Omega.
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N&gt;2$, $f\in L^m(\Omega)$, where $m&gt;1$ and $g$, $h$ are two Carath\'eodory functions, which may be non monotone. We prove that under appropriate conditions on $g$ and $h$, there is gain of Sobolev and Lebesgue regularity for the solutions of this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study blow up behavior of the semilinear parabolic inequality with $p$-Laplacian operator and nonlinear source $u_t - \Delta_p u \geq \sigma(x, t)f(u)$ on a locally finite connected weighted graph $G = (V, E)$. We extend the comparison principle and thereby establish the relationship between the initial value and the existence of blow-up solutions to the problem under different growth rates of $f$. We prove that when the growth rate of $f$ exceeds linear growth, blow-up solutions exist under appropriate initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential Weyl calculus on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for Weyl quantization on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, in which pseudodifferential operators act on sections of vector bundles equipped with arbitrary connections. We construct the associated star product and compute its semiclassical expansion up to third order in the expansion parameter. A central feature of our approach is a one-to-one correspondence between formally self-adjoint symbols and formally self-adjoint operators, extending known results from flat space to curved geometries. In addition, we analyze the Moyal equation satisfied by the Wigner function in this setting and provide explicit computations of Weyl symbols for several physically significant operators, including the Dirac, Maxwell, linearized Yang-Mills, and linearized Einstein operators. Our results lay the foundation for future developments in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, semiclassical analysis, and chiral kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>The Arrow-Hurwicz iteration for virtual element discretizations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed analysis of the Arrow-Hurwicz iteration applied to the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, discretized by a divergence-free mixed virtual element method. Under a set of appropriate assumptions, it is rigorously demonstrated that the method exhibits geometric convergence, with a contraction factor that remains independent of the mesh sizes. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings and to assess the computational performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Convergence of drift-diffusion PDEs arising as Wasserstein gradient flows of convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantitative convergence of drift-diffusion PDEs that arise as Wasserstein gradient flows of linearly convex functions over the space of probability measures on ${\mathbb R}^d$. In this setting, the objective is in general not displacement convex, so it is not clear a priori whether global convergence even holds. Still, our analysis reveals that diffusion {allows} a favorable interaction between Wasserstein geometry and linear convexity, leading to a general quantitative convergence theory, analogous to that of gradient flows in convex settings in the Euclidean space.
  Specifically, we prove that if the objective is convex and suitably coercive, the suboptimality gap decreases at a rate $O(1/t)$. This improves to a rate faster than any polynomial -- or even exponential in compact settings -- when the objective is strongly convex relative to the entropy.
  Our results extend the range of mean-field Langevin dynamics that enjoy quantitative convergence guarantees, and enable new applications to optimization over the space of probability measures. To illustrate this, we show quantitative convergence results for the minimization of entropy-regularized nonconvex problems, we propose and study an \emph{approximate Fisher Information} regularization covered by our setting, and we apply our results to an estimator for trajectory inference which involves the minimization of the relative entropy with respect to the Wiener measure in path space.</description>

      <title>Conformal scattering of the Maxwell-scalar field system on de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove small data energy estimates of all orders of differentiability between past null infinity and future null infinity of de Sitter space for the conformally invariant Maxwell-scalar field system. This allows us to construct bounded and invertible, but nonlinear, scattering operators taking past asymptotic data to future asymptotic data. We also deduce exponential decay rates for solutions with data having at least two derivatives, and for more regular solutions discover an asymptotic decoupling of the scalar field from the charge. The construction involves a carefully chosen complete gauge fixing condition which allows us to control all components of the Maxwell potential, and a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality for higher order estimates.</description>

      <title>An extension theorem for weak solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations and applications to singular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an extension theorem for local solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations. More precisely, we show that if a smooth vector field satisfies the Euler equations in a spacetime region $\Omega\times(0,T)$, one can choose an admissible weak solution on $\mathbf R^3\times (0,T)$ of class $C^\beta$ for any $\beta&lt;1/3$ such that both fields coincide on $\Omega\times (0,T)$. Moreover, one controls the spatial support of the global solution. Our proof makes use of a new extension theorem for local subsolutions of the incompressible Euler equations and a $C^{1/3}$ convex integration scheme implemented in the context of weak solutions with compact support in space. We present two nontrivial applications of these ideas. First, we construct infinitely many admissible weak solutions of class $C^\beta_{\text{loc}}$ with the same vortex sheet initial data, which coincide with it at each time $t$ outside a turbulent region of width $O(t)$. Second, given any smooth solution $v$ of the Euler equation on $\mathbf T^3\times(0,T)$ and any open set $U \subset \mathbf T^3$, we construct admissible weak solutions which coincide with $v$ outside $U$ and are uniformly close to it everywhere at time 0, yet blow up dramatically on a subset of $U\times (0,T)$ of full Hausdorff dimension. These solutions are of class $C^\beta$ outside their singular set.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A note for double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof for the interior double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of the Euler Equations in a bounded $C^2$-domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$; $d\geq 3$. That is, for velocity $u \in C^{0,\gamma}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^d)$ with some $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1/2$, we show that the pressure $p \in C^{0,2\gamma}_{\rm int}(\Omega)$. This is motivated by the studies of turbulence and anomalous dissipation in mathematical hydrodynamics and, recently, has been established in [L. De Rosa, M. Latocca, and G. Stefani, Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024.3 (2024), 2511--2560] over $C^{2,1}$-domains by means of pseudodifferential calculus. Our approach involves only standard elliptic PDE techniques, and relies on a variant of the modified pressure introduced in [C. W. Bardos, D. W. Boutros, and E. S. Titi, H\"{o}lder regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 249 (2025), 28] and the potential estimates in [L. Silvestre, unpublished notes]. The key novel ingredient of our proof is the introduction of two cutoff functions whose localisation parameters are carefully chosen as a power of the distance to $\partial\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics approximation schemes for anisotropic mean curvature flows with a forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of threshold dynamics-type approximation schemes to propagating fronts evolving according to an anisotropic mean curvature motion in the presence of a forcing term depending on both time and position, thus generalizing the consistency result obtained in [Ishii-Pires-Souganidis, 1999] by extending the results obtained in [Caffarelli-Souganidis, 2010] for $\alpha \in [1,2)$ to anisotropic kernels and in the presence of a driving force. The limit geometric evolution is of a variational type and can be approximated, at a large scale, by eikonal-type equations modeling dislocations dynamics. We prove that it preserves convexity under suitable convexity assumptions on the forcing term and that convex evolutions of compact sets are unique. If the initial set is bounded and sufficiently large, and the driving force is constant, then the corresponding generalized front propagation is asymptotically similar to the Wulff shape.</description>

      <title>Critical exponent for the one-dimensional wave equation with a space-dependent scale invariant damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional wave equation with space-dependent damping of the form $\mu_0(1+x^2)^{-1/2}$, where $\mu_0&gt;0$, and time derivative nonlinearity.
  We establish global existence of mild solutions for small data compactly supported by employing energy estimates within suitable Sobolev spaces of the associated homogeneous problem.
  Furthermore, we derive a blow-up result under some positive initial data by employing the test function method. This shows that the critical exponent is given by $p_G(1+\mu_0)=1+2/\mu_0$, when $\mu_0\in (0,1]$, where $p_G$ is the Glassey exponent. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first identification of the critical exponent range for this class of equations. As by product, we extend the global existence result to a more general class of space/time nonlinearities of the form $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_x u|^{q}$ or $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_tu|^{p}|\partial_x u|^{q}$, with $p,q&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of Bianchi-Egnell stability extremizer for the Hardy-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the best Bianchi-Egnell constant for the Hardy-Sobolev (HS) inequality \begin{align*} C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) := \inf_{{u \ \small \mbox{not an optimizer}}} \frac{\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left(|\nabla u|^2 - \frac{\gamma}{|x|^2}u^2\right) \ {\rm d}x - S_{\gamma}\|u\|_{L^{2^{\star}}}^2}{\mbox{dist} (u, \ \mbox{set of optimizers})^2}, \end{align*} is attained, extending the result of K\"onig [arXiv:2211.14185] for the classical Sobolev inequality (that corresponds to $\gamma = 0$). One of the main difficulties is that the third eigenspace of the linearized operator may contain only spherical harmonics of degree $1$, and hence, an essential non-vanishing criterion fails [arXiv:2210.08482]. This non-vanishing criterion is indispensable for proving the best Bianchi-Egnell constant $C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) &lt; C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}^{\tiny\mbox{{loc}}}(\gamma)$ that prevents a minimizing sequence converging to one of the optimizers. In addition, not being translation invariant, extracting a non-zero weak limit from a minimizing sequence presents difficulties. We found another hidden critical level $C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) &lt;1 - \frac{S_{\gamma}}{S},$ where $S$ is the best Sobolev constant that plays a significant role in proving the existence of an extremizer. In particular, we show that there exists a $\gamma_0&gt;0$ such that for $\gamma \geq \gamma_0,\ C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma)$ is attained. Moreover, we remark that there is a region $\gamma_0 \leq \gamma &lt; \gamma_c^{\star},$ where the third eigenspace of the linearized operator contains only spherical harmonics of degree $1.$ Our result improves some of the results in Wei-Wu [arXiv:2308.04667] corresponding to the HS inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider obstacle problems for nonlinear stochastic evolution equations. More precisely, the leading operator in our equation is a nonlinear, second order pseudomonotone operator of Leray-Lions type. The multiplicative noise term is given by a stochastic integral with respect to a Q-Wiener process. We show well-posedness of the associated initial value problem for random initial data on a bounded domain with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. First, we consider a singular perturbation of our problem by a higher order operator. Through the a priori estimates for the approximate solutions of the singular perturbation, only weak convergence is obtained. This convergence is not compatible with the nonlinearities in the equation. Therefore we use the theorems of Prokhorov and Skorokhod to establish existence of martingale solutions. Then, path-wise uniqueness follows from a L1-contraction principle and we may apply the method of Gy\"ongy-Krylov to obtain stochastically strong solutions. These well-posedness results serve as a basis for the study of variational inequalities and Lewy-Stampacchia's inequalities for our problem.</description>

      <title>Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's entropy from Colding's monotonic volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>
