      <title>Certified algebraic curve projections by path tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm that takes a smooth algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and computes an isotopic approximation for a generic projection of the curve into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our algorithm is designed for curves given implicitly by the zeros of $n-1$ polynomials, but it can be partially extended to parametrically defined curves. The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation illustrating the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Flip Graphs for Polynomial Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flip graphs were recently introduced in order to discover new matrix multiplication methods for matrix sizes. The technique applies to other tensors as well. In this paper, we explore how it performs for polynomial multiplication.</description>

      <title>What Kind of Morphisms Induces Covering Maps over a Real Closed Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show that a flat morphism of k-varieties (char k=0) whose fibers consist of a finite constant number of geometric points becomes finite \'etale after reduction. When k is a real closed field, we prove that such a morphism induces covering map on the rational points.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem R(3, k) seeks to determine the smallest value of n such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size k. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey R(3, k) problem such as R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MATHCHECK to generate certificates for Ramsey problems R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) (and symmetrically R(8, 3) and R(9, 3)) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves R(8, 3) sequentially in 18.5 hours, while a SAT-only approach using the state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problem like R(9, 3) we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Model Human Learners: Computational Models to Guide Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructional designers face an overwhelming array of design choices, making it challenging to identify the most effective interventions. To address this issue, I propose the concept of a Model Human Learner, a unified computational model of learning that can aid designers in evaluating candidate interventions. This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical insights into why an instructional intervention is effective. These findings lay the groundwork for future Model Human Learners that integrate cognitive and learning theories to support instructional design across diverse tasks and interventions.</description>
