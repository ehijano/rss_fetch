      <title>Comment on "Which is greater: $e^{\pi}$ or $\pi^{e}$? An unorthodox physical solution to a classic puzzle"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent Note (Am. J. Phys. 92:397, 2024; arXiv:2309.10826), Vallejo and Bove provide a physical argument based nominally on the second law of thermodynamics as a way of resolving the mathematical question appearing in the title. A remarkable aspect of their argument is that it does not depend on the numerical value of $\pi$, because $e^{x} \ge x^{e}$ for all positive $x$, with equality occurring only when $x = e$. Moreover, their argument does not depend on the validity of the second law but is rather a limited proof of it for this particular case.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response Theory with Relativistic Corrections: Selfconsistency and Validity of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation (SP-eq) derived from weakly relativistic approximation (WRA) of Dirac eq, combined with Electromagnetic (EM) field Lagrangian for variational principle, is expected to give a new level of EM response theory. A complete process of this formulation within the second order WRA is given, with explicit forms of charge and current densities, $\rho , \vec{J}$, and electric and magnetic polarizations, $\vec{P}$, $\vec{M}$ containing correction terms. They fulfill, not only the continuity equation, but also the relations $\nabla \cdot \vec{P}=-\rho, \ \partial \vec{P}/\partial t + c \nabla \times \vec{M} = \vec{J}$, known in the classical EM theory for the corresponding macroscopic variables. This theory should be able to describe all the EM responses within the second order WRA, and the least necessary variables are ${\phi, \vec{A}, \rho, \vec{J}}$ (six independent components). From this viewpoint, there emerges a problem about the use of "spin current" popularly discussed in spintronics, because it does not belong to the group of least necessary variables.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Allosteric propagation of curvature along filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a filament transmit the curvatures across the constituting modules and control them at one of its end? Inspired by the observation of protofilament - constituent biopolymer of microtubule - this question is addressed by a constructive approach. In our model a simple allosteric element in each module couples with the neighboring modules at its interfaces, which gives rise to a single degree of freedom to control the global shape of the filament. The model can be analyzed in analogy with discrete-time dynamical systems having a bifurcation of trans-critical type.</description>
