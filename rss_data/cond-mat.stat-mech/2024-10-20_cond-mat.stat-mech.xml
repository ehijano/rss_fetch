      <title>The emergence of Newtonian mechanics from the inhomogeneity of an ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the observation of Max Born (M. Born 1969) that the Newton's second law can emerge from a purely statistical perspective, we derive the evolution equation about the statistical distribution for dilute gas based solely on statistical principles, without invoking Newtonian mechanics, and then obtain the equations of motion for individual particles. Newton's second law for a single particle naturally emerges when the distribution reaches equilibrium. We demonstrate that the magnitude of an external force, traditionally measured by particle acceleration, can be understood as a measure of distribution inhomogeneity. We further show that the entropic force (utilized in current gravity studies) is equivalent to the statistical force and under non-equilibrium conditions, a deviation arises between the entropic force and the Newtonian force. This framework offers a novel perspective distinct from classical Newtonian mechanics and broadens the potential scope of its application.</description>

      <title>Change-point detection in anomalous-diffusion trajectories utilising machine-learning-based uncertainty estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When recording the movement of individual animals, cells or molecules one will often observe changes in their diffusive behaviour at certain points in time along their trajectory. In order to capture the different diffusive modes assembled in such heterogeneous trajectories it becomes necessary to segment them by determining these change-points. Such a change-point detection can be challenging for conventional statistical methods, especially when the changes are subtle. We here apply Bayesian Deep Learning to obtain point-wise estimates of not only the anomalous diffusion exponent but also the uncertainties in these predictions from a single anomalous diffusion trajectory generated according to four theoretical models of anomalous diffusion. We show that we are able to achieve an accuracy similar to single-mode (without change-points) predictions as well as a well calibrated uncertainty predictions of this accuracy. Additionally, we find that the predicted uncertainties feature interesting behaviour at the change-points leading us to examine the capabilities of these predictions for change-point detection. While the series of predicted uncertainties on their own are not sufficient to improve change-point detection, they do lead to a performance boost when applied in combination with the predicted anomalous diffusion exponents.</description>

      <title>Quenching from superfluid to free bosons in two dimensions: entanglement, symmetries, and quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice after a sudden quench from the superfluid phase to the free-boson regime. The initial superfluid state is described approximately using both the Bogoliubov theory and the Gaussian variational principle. The subsequent time evolution remains Gaussian, and we compare the results from each approximation of the initial state by examining different aspects of the dynamics. First, we analyze the entanglement entropy and observe that, in both cases, it increases linearly with time before reaching a saturation point. This behavior is attributed to the propagation of entangled pairs of quantum depletions in the superfluid state. Next, we explore the fate of particle-number symmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the superfluid phase. To do so, we use the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that enables us to track symmetry breaking within a subsystem. We observe that its evolution varies qualitatively depending on the theory used to describe the initial state. However, in both cases, the symmetry remains broken and is never restored in the stationary state. Finally, we assess the time it takes to reach the stationary state by evaluating the quantum fidelity between the stationary reduced density matrix and the time-evolved one. Interestingly, within the Gaussian variational principle, we find that an initial state further from the stationary state can relax more quickly than one closer to it, indicating the presence of the recently discovered quantum Mpemba effect. We derive the microscopic conditions necessary for this effect to occur and demonstrate that these conditions are never met in the Bogoliubov theory.</description>

      <title>Spin-$S$ Ising Models with Multi-Spin Interactions on the One-Dimensional Chain and Two-Dimensional Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin-$S$ Ising models with $p$-spin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. Here, $S$ denotes the magnitude of the spin and $p$ represents the number of spins involved in each interaction. The analysis is performed for $S=1/2,1,3/2,2$ and $p=3,4,5$. For the one-dimensional model, we formulate transfer matrices, and numerically diagonalize them to analyze the temperature dependence of the free energy and spin-spin correlations. In the case of $S=1/2$, the free energy does not depend on $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are uniformly enhanced across all temperature scales as $p$ increases. In contrast, for $S \geq 1$, the free energy varies with $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are significantly enhanced at lower temperatures as $p$ increases. For the two-dimensional model, by using multicanonical simulations, we analyze physical quantities such as an order parameter, internal energy and specific heat. In addition, we define and examine an order parameter to distinguish order and disordered phases. It is found that a first-order phase transition occurs at finite temperatures for all $S$ and $p\geq3$, and increasing $p$ strengthens its nature. We present $S$ and $p$ dependence of the transition temperature and latent heat, and discuss effects of higher-order interactions on the nature of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Explosive rigidity percolation in origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami, the traditional art of paper folding, has revolutionized science and technology in recent years and has been found useful in various real-world applications. In particular, origami-inspired structures have been utilized for robotics and mechanical information storage, in both of which the rigidity control of origami plays a crucial role. However, most prior works have only considered the origami design problem using purely deterministic or stochastic approaches. In this paper, we study the rigidity control of origami using the idea of explosive percolation. Specifically, to turn a maximally floppy origami structure into a maximally rigid origami structure, one can combine a random sampling process of origami facets and some simple selection rules, which allow us to exploit the power of choices and significantly accelerate or delay the rigidity percolation transition. We further derive simple formulas that connect the rigidity percolation transition effects with the origami pattern size and the number of choices, thereby providing an effective way to determine the optimal number of choices for achieving prescribed rigidity percolation transition accuracy and sharpness. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the rigidity control of mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two kinds of fermionic anyons, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy in the out-of-equilibrium and equilibrium regimes. Analytical approaches based on field theory predict that the universality class of this model is that of the three-dimensional site-diluted Ising model. We have been able to estimate the dynamic critical exponent by working in the equilibrium regime and by computing the integrated autocorrelation times obtaining $z=2.50(5)$ (free scaling corrections) and $z=2.31(7)$ (by fixing the scaling corrections to that of the 3D site-diluted Ising model). In the out-of-equilibrium regime we have focused in the study of the dynamic correlation length which has allowed us to compute the dynamic critical exponent obtaining $z=2.38(2)$, which is compatible with the equilibrium ones. Finally, both estimates are also compatible with the most accurate prediction $z=2.35(2)$ from numerical simulations of the 3D site-diluted Ising model, in agreement with the predictions based on field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to numerically calculate R\'enyi entanglement entropies in lattice quantum field theory using generative models. We describe how flow-based approaches can be combined with the replica trick using a custom neural-network architecture around a lattice defect connecting two replicas. Numerical tests for the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in two and three dimensions demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations, and exhibit a promising scaling with the defect size.</description>

      <title>Responding to objections made by Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} concerning kinetic molecular theory: an illustration of how to teach physics students to evaluate pseudoscientific work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} has argued that kinetic molecular theory does not correctly describe thermal equilibrium in ideal gases and has provided some examples that purportedly show that the standard laws imply consequences that contradict experimental results. This paper considers a few of the examples in detail and concludes that Co\c{s}ofre\c{t}'s analysis is erroneous. Furthermore, although it does not disprove any of the other claims made by Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} in criticising thermodynamics and many other fields of physics, it does call his whole project into question, as Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} exhibits a lack of relevant training, limited knowledge of key facts and previous research, and a disposition to favour his own intuitions above theoretical and experimental checks. The exercise below illustrates some of the problems commonly encountered in pseudoscientific approaches, and provides a few tips on how to teach aspiring scientists about how to evaluate such works for themselves.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameter optimization analysis of dynamical quantum critical phenomena in long-range transverse-field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading-order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully obtained numerical evidence supporting $\sigma = 7/4$ as the universality boundary between the latter two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional site percolation, all lattice sites are occupied with the same probability. For a bipartite lattice, sublattice-selective percolation instead involves two independent occupation probabilities, depending on the sublattice to which a given site belongs. Here, we determine the corresponding phase diagram for the two-dimensional square and Lieb lattices from quantifying the parameter regime where a percolating cluster persists for sublattice-selective percolation. For this purpose, we present an adapted Newman-Ziff algorithm. We also consider the critical exponents at the percolation transition, confirming previous Monte Carlo and renormalization-group findings that suggest sublattice-selective percolation to belong to the same universality class as conventional site percolation. To further strengthen this conclusion, we finally treat sublattice-selective percolation on the Bethe lattice (infinite Cayley tree) by an exact solution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in $XY$ model: a Monte Carlo and mean-field theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical phases and phase transitions arising in a classical two-dimensional anisotropic $XY$ model under the influence of a periodically driven temporal external magnetic field in the form of a symmetric square wave. We use a combination of finite temperature classical Monte Carlo simulation, implemented within a CPU + GPU paradigm, utilizing local dynamics provided by the Glauber algorithm and a phenomenological equation-of-motion approach based on relaxational dynamics governed by the time-dependent free energy within a mean-field approximation to study the model. We investigate several parameter regimes of the variables (magnetic field, anisotropy, and the external drive frequency) that influence the anisotropic $XY$ system. We identify four possible dynamical phases -- Ising-SBO, Ising-SRO, $XY$-SBO and $XY$-SRO. Both techniques indicate that only three of them (Ising-SRO, Ising-SBO, and $XY$-SRO) are stable dynamical phases in the thermodynamic sense. Within the Monte Carlo framework, a finite size scaling analysis shows that $XY$-SBO does not survive in the thermodynamic limit giving way to either an Ising-SBO or a $XY$-SRO regime. The finite size scaling analysis further shows that the transitions between the three remaining dynamical phases either belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class or are first-order in nature. The mean-field calculations yield three stable dynamical phases, i.e., Ising-SRO, Ising-SBO and $XY$-SRO, where the final steady state is independent of the initial condition chosen to evolve the equations of motion, as well as a region of bistability where the system either flows to Ising-SBO or $XY$-SRO (Ising-SRO) depending on the initial condition. Unlike the stable dynamical phases, the $XY$-SBO represents a transient feature that is eventually lost to either Ising-SBO or $XY$-SRO.</description>

      <title>Noninteracting particles in a harmonic trap with a stochastically driven center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system of $N$ noninteracting particles on a line in the presence of a harmonic trap $U(x)=\mu \bigl[x-z(t)\bigr]^2/2$, where the trap center $z(t)$ undergoes a bounded stochastic modulation. We show that this stochastic modulation drives the system into a nonequilibrium stationary state, where the joint distribution of the positions of the particles is not factorizable. This indicates strong correlations between the positions of the particles that are not inbuilt, but rather get generated by the dynamics itself. Moreover, we show that the stationary joint distribution can be fully characterized and has a special conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure. This special structure allows us to compute several observables analytically even in such a strongly correlated system, for an arbitrary bounded drive $z(t)$. These observables include the average density profile, the correlations between particle positions, the order and gap statistics, as well as the full counting statistics. We then apply our general results to two specific examples where (i) $z(t)$ represents a dichotomous telegraphic noise, and (ii) $z(t)$ represents an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the microcanonical population annealing algorithm with the Wang-Landau algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10865</link>

Abstract: The development of new algorithms for simulations in physics is as important as the development of new analytical methods. In this paper, we present a comparison of the recently developed microcanonical population annealing (MCPA) algorithm with the rather mature Wang-Landau algorithm. The comparison is performed on two cases of the Potts model that exhibit a first-order phase transition. We compare the simulation results of both methods with exactly known results, including the finite-dimensional dependence of the maximum of the specific heat capacity. We evaluate the Binder cumulant minimum, the ratio of peaks in the energy distribution at the critical temperature, the energies of the ordered and disordered phases, and interface tension. Both methods exhibit similar accuracy at selected sets of modeling parameters.</description>

      <title>Managing Singular Kernels and Logarithmic Corrections in the Staggered Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the staggered six-vertex model with ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry for arbitrary system sizes $L$ using non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). Our study is motivated by two key questions: what is the accuracy of results based on the ODE/IQFT correspondence in the asymptotic regime of large system sizes, and what is the optimal approach based on NLIE for analyzing the staggered six-vertex model?
  We demonstrate that the quantization conditions for low-lying primary and descendant states, derived from the ODE/IQFT approach in the scaling limit, are impressively accurate even for relatively small system sizes. Specifically, in the anisotropy parameter range $\pi/4 &lt; \gamma &lt; \pi/2$, the difference between NLIE and ODE/IQFT results for energy and quasi-momentum eigenvalues is of order $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2})$.
  Furthermore, we present a unifying framework for NLIEs, distinguishing between versions with singular and regular kernels. We provide a compact derivation of NLIE with a singular kernel, followed by an equivalent set with a regular kernel. We address the stability issues in numerical treatments and offer solutions to achieve high-accuracy results, validating our approach for system sizes ranging from $L=2$ to $L=10^{24}$.
  Our findings not only validate the ODE/IQFT approach for finite system sizes but also enhance the understanding of NLIEs in the context of the staggered six-vertex model. We hope the insights gained from this study have significant implications for resolving the spectral problem of other lattice systems with emergent non-compact degrees of freedom and provide a foundation for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Extended edge modes and disorder preservation of a symmetry-protected topological phase out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time evolution of topological systems is an active area of interest due to their expected applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we analyze the dynamics of a noninteracting spinless fermion chain in its topological phase, quenched out of equilibrium by a Hamiltonian belonging to the same symmetry class. Due to particle-hole symmetry, the bulk properties of the system remain intact throughout its evolution. However, the boundary properties may be drastically altered, with the initially localized Majorana edge modes extending across the chain. Up to a timescale $t^*$, identified by area-law behavior of the entanglement entropy, these extended edge modes are an example of exotic effects in topological systems out of equilibrium. Further, while local disorder can be utilized to preserve localization and increase $t^*$, we still identify nontrivial dynamics in the Majorana polarization and Loschmidt echo.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Million-atom heat transport simulations of polycrystalline graphene approaching first-principles accuracy enabled by neuroevolution potential on desktop GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principles molecular dynamics simulations of heat transport in systems with large-scale structural features are challenging due to their high computational cost. Here, using polycrystalline graphene as a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of simulating heat transport with near first-principles accuracy in systems containing over 1.4 million atoms, achievable even with consumer desktop GPUs. This is enabled by the highly efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, as implemented in the open-source GPUMD package. Leveraging the NEP model's accuracy and efficiency, we quantify the reduction in thermal conductivity of polycrystalline graphene due to grain boundaries with varying grain sizes, resolving contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes. Additionally, we find that grain boundaries can lead to finite thermal conductivity even under significant tensile strain, in contrast to the divergent behavior observed in pristine graphene under similar conditions, indicating that grain boundaries may play a crucial role in thermal transport in low-dimensional momentum-conserving systems. These findings could offer insights for interpreting experimental observations, given the widespread presence of both large-scale grain boundaries and external strains in real materials. The demonstrated ability to simulate millions of atoms with near-first-principles accuracy on consumer desktop GPUs using the NEP approach will help make large-scale high-fidelity atomistic simulations more accessible to the broader research community.</description>
