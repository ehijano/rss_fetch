      <title>Euler topology in classical spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids have recently been analyzed in view of the single-gap homotopy classification of their dispersive eigenvectors. We show that the recent progress in defining multi-gap topologies, notably exemplified by the Euler class, can be naturally included in these homotopy-based classification schemes and present phases that change topology by band node braiding. This process alters the topology of the pinch points in the spin structure factor and consequently their stability. Furthermore, we discuss how these notions also pertain to models discussed previously in the literature and have a broader range of application beyond our specific results. Our work thus opens up an uncharted avenue in the understanding of spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Full, three-quarter, half and quarter Wigner crystals in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</description>

      <title>A Mobile Impurity in the Kitaev Chain: Phase Diagram and Signatures of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the physics of a mobile impurity immersed in a $1d$ topological superconductor. We discuss the system's phase diagram obtained with exact diagonalization. We argue that the character of the transition from a weak to strong coupling regime depends on the phase of the host superconductor. A smooth crossover between a weakly coupled polaron and a molecular state is observed in the topological phase. In contrast, the impurity undergoes a sharp phase transition in a topologically trivial background.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</description>

      <title>Gapless spinon excitations emerging from a multipolar transverse field in the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet NaTmSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triangular-lattice quantum Ising antiferromagnet is a promising platform for realizing Anderson's quantum spin liquid, though finding suitable materials to realize it remains a challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive study of NaTmSe2 using magnetization, specific heat, neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation, combined with theoretical calculations. We demonstrate that NaTmSe2 realizes the transverse field Ising model and quantitatively determine its exchange parameters. Our results reveal a multipolar spin-polarized state coexisting with a dipolar spin-disordered state. These states feature gapless spinon excitations mediated by the multipolar moments. The study shows how multiple types of magnetism can emerge in distinct magnetic channels (dipolar and multipolar) within a single magnet, advancing our understanding of spin-frustrated Ising physics and opening pathways for different quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</description>

      <title>Local variations of the magnetization effected by an external field in molecular rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that an external magnetic field generates local variations of the classical ground-state magnetization in molecular rings of antiferromagnetic icosahedra with isotropic spin interactions. The magnetic response is characterized by a multitude of magnetization discontinuities occurring across the ring. In addition, a parity effect with respect to the number of icosahedra allows for magnetization jumps that occur at different field values for different molecules and produce an even more pronounced local variation of the magnetization. It is also found that for specific field ranges all canting angles of the molecular magnetizations increase with the field. These findings are in sharp contrast with the ones for rings of individual spins.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquids: the nonperturbative renormalization group perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a thorough theoretical framework based on the nonperturvative renormalization group (RG) a la Wetterich to tackle the interplay of coupled fermionic and order-parameter fluctuations at metallic quantum critical points with ordering wavevectors $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. We consistently treat the dynamical emergence of the Landau damping of the bosonic mode and non-Fermi liquid scaling of fermions upon lowering the cutoff scale. The loop integrals of the present theory involve only contributions from fluctuations above the cutoff scale, which drive the system to a non-Fermi liquid RG fixed point of different scaling properties from those obtained within the random phase approximation (RPA) or expansions around it. In particular the scaling exponent for the Fermi self-energy acquires the value $\alpha\approx 0.50$ rather than the anticipated $\alpha\approx 0.66$, while the bosonic dynamical exponent $z\approx 2$. We demonstrate how results characteristic for the RPA-type fixed-point scaling are recovered in our framework by a questionable procedure of removing the fermionic cutoff much faster than the bosonic one.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities in an extended Hubbard model on honecycomb lattice incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \( t'' \). Using quantum Monte Carlo methods, we identify a crossover between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations near higher-order Van Hove singularities filling, where \( t'' \) enhances ferromagnetic correlations below while suppressing antiferromagnetic fluctuations toward half-filling. At low doping, \( f_n \)-wave pairing dominates, amplified by higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states. Remarkably, despite general suppression of \( f_n \)-wave pairing by increasing next-nearest neighbor hopping \( t' \) and \( t'' \), a critical \( t'' = 0.15 \) triggers anomalous enhancement via higher-order Van Hove singularities renormalization at a fix $t'$. The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions \( V \) suppress superconducting correlation, which exhibiting sign-independent suppression proportional to \( |V| \). These results highlight the interplay of higher-order Van Hove singularities-driven electronic structure, magnetic fluctuations, and pairing symmetry competition in electron correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Magnetic Phases with Synthetic Data and Physics-Informed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms, acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter and statistical physics contexts.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of charge density wave and field-tuned magnetic states in TmNiC$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a general mechanism that allows (1+1)d CFTs to have interesting interface conformal manifolds even in the absence of any continuous internal symmetry or supersymmetry. This is made possible by the breaking of an enhanced continuous symmetry, which is generically non-invertible, arising in the folded theory. We provide several examples and showcase the power of the symmetry-based approach by computing the evolution of the reflection coefficient along the defect conformal manifold. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations and we comment on no-go theorems.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and soft phonon evolution in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.</description>

      <title>Unconventional polaronic ground state in superconducting LiTi$_2$O$_4$</title>

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated lattices can display a range of correlated phenomena, ranging from spin frustration and charge order to dispersionless flat bands due to quantum interference. One particularly compelling family of such materials is the half-valence spinel Li$B_2$O$_4$ materials. On the $B$-site frustrated pyrochlore sublattice, the interplay of correlated metallic behavior and charge frustration leads to a superconducting state in LiTi$_2$O$_4$ and heavy fermion behavior in LiV$_2$O$_4$. To date, however, LiTi$_2$O$_4$ has primarily been understood as a conventional BCS superconductor despite a lattice structure that could host more exotic groundstates. Here, we present a multimodal investigation of LiTi$_2$O$_4$, combining ARPES, RIXS, proximate magnetic probes, and ab-initio many-body theoretical calculations. Our data reveals a novel mobile polaronic ground state with spectroscopic signatures that underlie co-dominant electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron correlations also found in the lightly doped cuprates. The cooperation between the two interaction scales distinguishes LiTi$_2$O$_4$ from other superconducting titanates, suggesting an unconventional origin to superconductivity in LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Our work deepens our understanding of the rare interplay of electron-electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling in unconventional superconducting systems. In particular, our work identifies the geometrically frustrated, mixed-valence spinel family as an under-explored platform for discovering unconventional, correlated ground states.</description>

      <title>Two-local modifications of SYK model with quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model may provide us with a good starting point for the experimental study of quantum chaos and holography in the laboratory. Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. In this paper, we argue that the four-local interaction may not be important by introducing a few models that have two-local interactions. The first model is a generalization of the spin-SYK model, which is obtained by replacing the spin variables with SU($d$) generators. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos already for two-local interactions in a wide energy range. We also introduce modifications of spin-SYK and SYK models that have similar structures to the SU($d$) model (e.g., $H=\sum_{p,q}J_{pq}\chi_p\chi_{p+1}\chi_q\chi_{q+1}$ instead of the original SYK Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{p,q,r,s}J_{pqrs}\chi_p\chi_q\chi_r\chi_{s}$), which shows strongly chaotic features although the interaction is essentially two-local. These models may be a good starting point for the quantum simulation of the original SYK model.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Giant elastoresistance in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated and topological phases in moir\'e materials are exquisitely sensitive to lattice geometry at both atomic and superlattice length scales. Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moir\'e material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in analog and digital quantum-simulation platforms have enabled exploration of the spectrum of entanglement Hamiltonians via variational algorithms. In this work we analyze the convergence properties of the variationally obtained solutions and compare them to numerically exact calculations in quantum critical systems. We demonstrate that interpreting the cost functional as an integral permits the deployment of iterative quadrature schemes, thereby reducing the required number of measurements by several orders of magnitude. We further show that a modified ansatz captures deviations from the Bisognano-Wichmann form in lattice models, improves convergence, and provides a cost-function-level diagnostic for quantum phase transitions. Finally, we establish that a low cost value does not by itself guarantee convergence in trace distance. Nevertheless, it faithfully reproduces degeneracies and spectral gaps, which are essential for applications to topological phases.</description>

      <title>Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarons due to spin-length fluctuations in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$ spin-orbit Mott systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mott insulators based on $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal ions, where spin-orbit interaction plays a key role, can exhibit various forms of unusual magnetism. A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing $d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the non-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed - via exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to a sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a long-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to fluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode appears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional magnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of magnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study their influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct a microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and address the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free and a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts with an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter case it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to dominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely contrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped Heisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in the Two-Site SYK and SYK Chain Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions suggested that the model does not rapidly thermalize, despite being maximally chaotic. In this work, I examine the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for both the SYK chain and the two-site SYK models using exact diagonalization. I show that single realizations of both models approximately satisfy ETH conditions, while ensemble averages strictly satisfy ETH. Therefore, I conclude that the finite-size SYK chain and two-site SYK models can rapidly thermalize with respect to generic few-body operators through the ETH mechanism. This suggests that the subthermal behavior observed in previous studies of R\'enyi entanglement entropy does not manifest in finite-size systems, and that these systems can thermalize rapidly via their light modes. It also indicates that the proposed gravitational dual may undergo rapid thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond and attosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in pulsed electron beams reflect the microscopic dynamics of emission and interparticle interaction. In femtosecond electron emission from nanoscale field emitters, Coulomb interactions result in structured few-electron states with strong correlations in energy, time, and transverse momentum. Interactions with external fields may be used to both probe and further manipulate these correlated states. Here, we combine femtosecond-gated, event-based detection with inelastic electron-light scattering to directly map the photoelectron phase-space distribution of two-electron states. Our experiments demonstrate a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space, with distinct contributions from interparticle interaction and dispersion. Moreover, we theoretically reveal that global phase modulation coherently shapes the few-electron phase-space distribution to exhibit attosecond temporal correlations. This controlled phasing of few-electron states can be harnessed to produce tailored excitations and super-radiance via two-electron energy post-selection.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Landscape of Correlated Orders in Strained Bilayer Nickelate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer at the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity due to the elongation of outer apical Ni-O bond length and electron-doping effect. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer slightly away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is moderately hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, density-wave instability is suppressed and the system exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Universal fault tolerant quantum computation in 2D without getting tied in knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.</description>
