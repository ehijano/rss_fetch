      <title>Enzymatic Mpemba Effect: Slowing of biochemical reactions by increasing enzyme concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the enzyme concentration generally speeds up enzymatic reactions. However, in this Letter, we show that increasing the enzyme concentration can also slow down the enzymatic reaction. We consider a simple allosteric protein with multiple modification sites, catalyzed by two enzymes with the same catalytic activity, but slightly different affinities. We show that increasing the concentration of one enzyme can slow the relaxation to the equilibrium state. The mechanism for this slowing is similar the Markovian Mpemba effect, and we name this phenomenon as the Enzymatic Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics of Salt-Dependent Reentrant Phase Behaviors Highlights Diverse Roles of ATP in Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) involving intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) is a major physical mechanism for biological membraneless compartmentalization. The multifaceted electrostatic effects in these biomolecular condensates are exemplified here by experimental and theoretical investigations of the different salt- and ATP-dependent LLPSs of an IDR of messenger RNA-regulating protein Caprin1 and its phosphorylated variant pY-Caprin1, exhibiting, e.g., reentrant behaviors in some instances but not others. Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating that interchain ion bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for other IDRs. The electrostatic nature of these features complements ATP's involvement in $\pi$-related interactions and as an amphiphilic hydrotrope, underscoring a general role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.</description>

      <title>pLDDT-Predictor: High-speed Protein Screening Using Transformer and ESM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold2, have revolutionized structural biology by achieving near-experimental accuracy ($\text{average RMSD} &lt; 1.5\text{\AA}$). However, the computational demands of these models (approximately 30 minutes per protein on an RTX 4090) significantly limit their application in high-throughput protein screening. While large language models like ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) have shown promise in extracting structural information directly from protein sequences, rapid assessment of protein structure quality for large-scale analyses remains a major challenge.
  We introduce pLDDT-Predictor, a high-speed protein screening tool that achieves a $250,000\times$ speedup compared to AlphaFold2 by leveraging pre-trained ESM2 protein embeddings and a Transformer architecture. Our model predicts AlphaFold2's pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) scores with a Pearson correlation of 0.7891 and processes proteins in just 0.007 seconds on average. Using a comprehensive dataset of 1.5 million diverse protein sequences (ranging from 50 to 2048 amino acids), we demonstrate that pLDDT-Predictor accurately classifies high-confidence structures (pLDDT $&gt;$ 70) with 91.2\% accuracy and achieves an MSE of 84.8142 compared to AlphaFold2's predictions.
  The source code and pre-trained models are freely available at \url{https://github.com/jw-chae/pLDDT_Predictor}, enabling the research community to perform rapid, large-scale protein structure quality assessments.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Allostery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental property of proteins that represents the functional coupling between distantly located sites. In different manifestations, this property underlies signal transduction, gene expression, and regulation -- elementary reactions in networks comprising cellular information and metabolic processing systems. In this work, we present a reduced theoretical model for allostery that encompasses the many diverse mechanisms described in past work. What emerges is a basic classification of different forms of allostery into two groups: those that couple distant sites through soft normal modes within a single state, and those that possess multiple states, with effective interactions between sites emerging only upon transitioning between these states. This work serves to unify the extensive past theoretical work on the phenomenology and machinery of allostery in proteins.</description>
