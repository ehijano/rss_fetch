      <title>Experimental Investigation of a Recurrent Optical Spectrum Slicing Receiver for Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection systems using Programmable Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally validate our previous numerical works in recurrent optical spectrum slicing (ROSS) accelerators for dispersion compensation in high-speed IM/DD links. For this, we utilize recurrent filters implemented both through a waveshaper and by exploiting novel integrated programmable photonic platforms. Different recurrent configurations are tested. The ROSS accelerators exploit frequency processing through recurrent optical filter nodes in order to mitigate the power fading effect, which hinders the transmission distance and baudrate scalability of IM/DD systems. By equalizing even 80 km of 64 Gb/s PAM-4 transmission in C-band, we prove that our system can offer an appealing solution in highly dispersive channels.</description>

      <title>Hole-Based Stealthy Hyperuniform Semiconductor Metamaterials for the Mid-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform heterostructures are a novel type of metamaterial with the potential for optical image processing at angles away from normal incidence. These metamaterials show analogous properties to photonic crystals while circumventing the spatial anisotropy often hindering the latter's use. In this paper, we have successfully designed, fabricated, and characterized a hole-based stealthy hyperuniform structure on a quantum cascade layer substrate. The infrared spectral data reveal a sizable gap-midgap ratio of 9.8% for a photonic band gap around $12.0 ~\mu m$ in the form of an enhanced reflection region for increasing incidence angles. The stealthy hyperuniform metamaterial also showed spatial isotropy by its unchanging reflection spectrum for all in-plane rotational angle measurements.</description>

      <title>HD snapshot diffractive spectral imaging and inferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel high-definition (HD) snapshot diffractive spectral imaging system utilizing a diffractive filter array (DFA) to capture a single image that encodes both spatial and spectral information. This single diffractogram can be computationally reconstructed into a spectral image cube, providing a high-resolution representation of the scene across 25 spectral channels in the 440-800 nm range at 1304x744 spatial pixels (~1 MP). This unique approach offers numerous advantages including snapshot capture, a form of optical compression, flexible offline reconstruction, the ability to select the spectral basis after capture, and high light throughput due to the absence of lossy filters. We demonstrate a 30-50 nm spectral resolution and compared our reconstructed spectra against ground truth obtained by conventional spectrometers. Proof-of-concept experiments in diverse applications including biological tissue classification, food quality assessment, and simulated stellar photometry validate our system's capability to perform robust and accurate inference. These results establish the DFA-based imaging system as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing scientific and industrial imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A piezoelectric ski-jump laser beam scanning chip-to-free space photonic link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seamless interface between integrated photonic processors and targets in free-space enables wide-ranging advancements in telescopy, free-space communication, optical ranging, materials processing, biomedical imaging, near eye display, machine optical intelligence and quantum control. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of diffraction limited spots in the far field. Leading approaches rely on scanners where the numerical aperture and actuator size are linked, resulting in a trade off between resolution, speed and footprint, whereas scanning fibers have been limited to bulk optical and mechanical components. Here, we introduce a CMOS fabricated photonic "ski-jump" composed of a broadband, single mode silicon nitride waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezo-actuated cantilever. The ski-jump passively curl 90 degrees out-of-plane via mechanical meta-stress engineering in a footprint of less than 0.1 mm squared and emit submicron diffraction-limited optical modes with piezoelectric steering. They also exhibit kHz-rate longitudinal and lateral mechanical resonances with displacement ranges exceeding 400 micron and 180 micron, respectively, and quality factors Q&gt;10,000 under vacuum. These resonances enable 2D beam scanning at footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 Megaspot/s-mm squared surpassing state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by more than 50. Using these devices, we demonstrate arbitrary 2D image projection and the repeatable initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancies in diamond waveguides. Based on current device performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 Giga-spots in a square cm area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>Graphene oxide two dimensional films for thermo-optic photonic integrated devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient heat management and control in optical devices, facilitated by advanced thermo-optic materials, is critical for many applications such as photovoltaics, thermal emitters, mode-locked lasers, and optical switches. Here, we investigate the thermo-optic properties of 2D graphene oxide (GO) films by precisely integrating them onto microring resonators (MRRs) with control over the film thicknesses and lengths. We characterize the refractive index, extinction coefficient, thermo-optic coefficient, and thermal conductivity of for the GO films with different layer numbers and degrees of reduction, including reversible reduction and enhanced optical bistability induced by photo-thermal effects. Experimental results show that the thermo-optic properties of 2D GO films vary widely with the degree of reduction, with significant polarization anisotropy, enabling efficient polarization sensitive devices. The versatile thermo-optic response of 2D GO substantially expands the scope of functionalities and devices that can be engineered, making it promising for a diverse range of thermo-optic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for the joint estimation of the centroid and the separation between two incoherent point sources cannot be saturated. As such, the optimal measurements for extracting maximal information about both at the same time are not known. In this work, we ascertain these optimal measurements for an arbitrary point spread function, in the most relevant regime of a small separation between the sources. Our measurement can be adjusted within a set of tradeoffs, allowing more information to be extracted from the separation or the centroid while ensuring that the total information is the maximum possible.</description>

      <title>Optical and X-ray Photo-emission Spectroscopies of Core/Shell Colloidal CdSe/CdS Quantum Dots: Modeling and Experimental Determination of Band Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of multilayer semi-conductor nano-emitters are crucially dependent on the relative energy levelsof their different components. For core/shell quantum dots, the relative energy difference between conduction bandedge of core and shell materials induces, depending on its value, either a confinement of the electron within the coreor a delocalization of its wave function within the whole quantum dot. This results in drastic consequences on theenergy and the oscillator strength of the fundamental transition. Surprisingly, the literature currently lacks a definitivevalue for the energy difference between CdSe and CdS conduction band edges as most of the experimental studiesprovide values corresponding to specific geometries of quantum dots. Here, we develop a full theoretical modelexpressing energy levels considering core/shell interface pressure, ligands and enabling the accurate prediction ofthe bandgap value with the nanocrystal size. It allows to reliably determine the energy difference between theconduction band edge of CdSe and CdS materials, known as the conduction band offset, in such a way that this valuecan later be used to model quantum dots of any geometry. This value is determined using our model and two differentexperimental methods: optical spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission (XPS) experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical Light in a Three-Waveguide Coupler with Second-Order Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible squeezed states generated in a three-waveguide nonlinear coupler operating with second harmonic generation is discussed. This study is carried out using two well-known techniques; the phase space method (based on positive P-representation) and the Heisenberg-based analytical perturbative method. The effect of the key design parameters is analyzed for both codirectional and contra-directional propagation. The optimal degree of feasible squeezing is identified. Also, the performance and capacities of both methods are critically evaluated. For low levels of key design parameters and in the early stages of evolution, a high level of agreement between the two methods is noticed. In the new era of quantum-based technology, the proposed system opens a new avenue for utilising nonlinear couplers in nonclassical light generation.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of broadband photon pairs in shallow-etched lithium niobate nanowaveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and fabricate shallow-etched periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide to realize highly-efficient broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC) on nanophotonic chip. The shallow-etched waveguide is capable to tolerate the non-uniformities of waveguide width induced by fabrication imperfections, enabling generation of photon pairs with high count rate and bandwidth. We demonstrate photon-pair generation with a high brightness of 11.7~GHz/mW and bandwidth of 22~THz, in a 5.7-mm-long PPLN waveguide. The generated photon pairs exhibit strong temporal correlation with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 16262$\pm$850. Our results confirm the feasibility of shallow etching in fabrication of efficient SPDC device on platform of lithium niobate on insulator, and benefit quantum information processing with broadband photon source.</description>

      <title>Free-electron coupling to surface polaritons mediated by small scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of surface polaritons (SPs) to enhance and manipulate light fields down to deep-subwavelength length scales enables applications in optical sensing and nonlinear optics at the nanoscale. However, the wavelength mismatch between light and SPs prevents direct optical excitation of surface-bound modes, thereby limiting the widespread development of SP-based photonics. Free electrons are a natural choice to directly excite strongly confined SPs because they can supply field components of high momentum at designated positions with subnanometer precision. Here, we theoretically explore free-electron--SP coupling mediated by small scatterers and show that low-energy electrons can efficiently excite surface modes with a maximum probability reached at an optimum surface--scatterer distance. By aligning the electron beam with a periodic array of scatterers placed near a polariton-supporting interface, in-plane Smith--Purcell emission results in the excitation of surface modes along well-defined directions. Our results support using scattering elements to excite SPs with low-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Thermocavitation in gold-coated microchannels for needle-free jet injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-wave lasers generated bubbles in microfluidic channels are proposed for applications such as needle-free jet injection due to their small size and affordable price of these lasers. However, water is transparent in the visible and near-IR regime, where the affordable diode lasers operate. Therefore a dye is required for absorption, which is often unwanted in thermocavitation applications such as vaccines or cosmetics. In this work we explore a different mechanism of the absorption of optical energy. The microfluidic channel wall is partially covered with a thin gold layer which absorbs light from a blue laser diode. This surface absorption is compared with the conventional volumetric absorption by a red dye. The results show that this surface absorption can be used to generate bubbles without the requirement of a dye. However, the generated bubbles are smaller and grow slower when compared to the dye-generated bubbles. Furthermore, heat dissipation in the glass channel walls affect the overall efficiency. Finally, degradation of the gold layer over time reduces the reproducibility and limits its lifetime. Further experiments and simulations are proposed to potentially solve these problems and optimize the bubble formation. Our findings can inform the design and operation of microfluidic devices used in phase transition experiments and other cavitation phenomena, such as jet injectors or liquid dispensing for bio-engineering.</description>

Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the leading protocols for demonstrating a quantum advantage, but the theory of how this protocol responds to noise is still incomplete. We extend the theory of classical simulation of boson sampling with partial distinguishability to the case where the degree of indistinguishability between photon pairs is different between different pairs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic surface polaritons at isotropic-uniaxial interface: an exact algebraic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface polaritons in an anisotropic media posses a strong dependence of the wavevector on the propagation direction, which is called the isofrequency contour. This can lead to the fact that polariton propagation is possible only in a limited range of angles in the boundary plane. Notable examples are Dyakonov surface waves at the boundary of two dielectrics and hyperbolic plasmons in a hyperbolic metamaterial. Exact closed-form solutions of the polariton dispersion equation are known only in special cases: in a weakly anisotropic medium, and in an arbitrary medium for highly symmetric directions of polariton propagation. This work provides an universal exact solution in algebraic form for surface polariton at the interface of an arbitrary isotropic and an uniaxial media for the case of the optic axis parallel to the boundary. As an example, it is used to analyze the shapes of isofrequency contours of surface polaritons. The work brings together previously scattered results of studies on surface polaritons of various types in uniaxial media. In addition to the cases already considered in the literature, a solution for surface polaritons at the boundary of a isotropic metal and a Type I hyperbolic medium is found. The case of "elliptic" polaritons at the boundary of an anisotropic metal-like medium is apparently analyzed here for the first time.</description>

Abstract: Periodical corrugation in dielectric slab transfers the two waveguide modes at zero Bloch wave number into a leaky resonant mode and a symmetry protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) with small frequency detune. The leaky resonant mode can be directly excited by weak linearly polarized normally incident optical field. In the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, the BIC can be indirectly excited by an optical bistable response. Two types of bistable operations are considered. For the first type, the intensity of the incident field gradually increases to exceed a critical value, and then decreases to zero. For the second type, the intensity is fixed, while the linear polarization angle of the incident field gradually increases to exceed a critical value, and then decreases to 0$^{o}$. Theoretically, the indirectly excited BIC can store the optical energy without loss, even though the intensity of the incident field decreases to zero. Incidence of an optical field with double frequency or orthogonal linear polarization can erase the stored optical field by destroying the BIC. The proposed optical system could function as optical storage and switching device.</description>

      <title>Magnetically tunable optical bound states in the continuum with arbitrary polarization and intrinsic chirality</title>

Abstract: Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs), exotic localized eigenstates embedded in the continuum spectrum and topological polarization singularity in momentum space, have attracted great attentions in both fundamental and applied physics. Here, based on magneto-optical photonic crystal slab placed in external magnetic fields to break the time-reversal symmetry, this paper theoretically demonstrates magnetically tunable BICs with arbitrary polarization covering the entire Poincar\'e sphere and efficient off-{\Gamma} chiral emission of circularly polarized states. More interestingly, by further breaking the in-plane inversion symmetry of the magneto-optical photonic crystal slab to generate a pair of circularly polarized states spawning from the eliminated BICs and tuning the external magnetic field strength to move one point to the {\Gamma} point, the intrinsic chiral BICs at the {\Gamma} point with near-unity circular dichroism exceeding 0.99 and a high quality factor of 46000 owning to the preserved out-of-plane mirror symmetry are observed. These findings may lead to a plethora of potential applications in chiral-optical effects, structured light, and tunable optical devices.</description>

      <title>Pixel-scale NIR-VIS Spectral Routers Based on 2D Mie-type Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The out-of-band energy loss caused by in-built color filters significantly degrades the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range of conventional image sensors, which has restricted the attempt to develop ultrahigh-density imaging devices by merely shrinking the pixel size. This issue will be more serious for security cameras which need to collect visible (VIS) light and near-infrared (NIR) photons as well. The existing solutions mostly explore complex photonic nanostructures, which are often too complicated for production. In this work, we demonstrate a pixel-scale spectral router utilizing two-dimensional (2D) Si3N4 Mie scattering metagratings that can spatially divide NIR (850 nm) and VIS (400-700 nm) light to different pixels at high efficiencies. It has a minimum feature size larger than 360 nm, highly promising for massive production. Compared with the traditional filter design, our router can gain about 42% and 30% signal enhancement for NIR and VIS band, respectively. We show that it also has good polarization insensitivity and incident angle tolerance. The NIR-VIS simultaneous imaging is inspected without any complex reconstruction algorithm. Mode analysis indicates that the multipolar scattering of our Mie-type metagratings provides the necessary degrees of freedom to spatially optimize the routing functions for broadband photons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical photon-photon interaction mediated by a quantum emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single photons constitute a main platform in quantum science and technology: they carry quantum information over extended distances in the future quantum internet and can be manipulated in advanced photonic circuits enabling scalable photonic quantum computing. The main challenge in quantum photonics is how to generate advanced entangled resource states and efficient light-matter interfaces. Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide for realizing quantum nonlinear interaction between single-photon wavepackets. This inherently multimode quantum system constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics. We demonstrate control of a photon with another photon and experimentally unravel the dynamical response of two-photon interactions mediated by a quantum emitter, and show that the induced quantum correlations are controlled by the pulse duration. The work will open new avenues for tailoring complex photonic quantum resource states.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>

Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <title>Efficient Characterizations of Multiphoton States with an Ultra-thin Optical Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurface enables the generation and manipulation of multiphoton entanglement with flat optics, providing a more efficient platform for large-scale photonic quantum information processing. Here, we show that a single metasurface optical device would allow more efficient characterizations of multiphoton entangled states, such as shadow tomography, which generally requires fast and complicated control of optical setups to perform information-complete measurements, a demanding task using conventional optics. The compact and stable device here allows implementations of general positive observable value measures with a reduced sample complexity and significantly alleviates the experimental complexity to implement shadow tomography. Integrating self-learning and calibration algorithms, we observe notable advantages in the reconstruction of multiphoton entanglement, including using fewer measurements, having higher accuracy, and being robust against experimental imperfections. Our work unveils the feasibility of metasurface as a favorable integrated optical device for efficient characterization of multiphoton entanglement, and sheds light on scalable photonic quantum technologies with ultra-thin optical devices.</description>

      <title>Silicon Photomultipliers for Detection of Photon Bunching Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, photon bunching from LED light was observed for the first time using SiPMs. The bunching signature was observed with a significance of $7.3~\sigma$ using 97~hs of data. The light was spectrally filtered using a 1~nm bandpass filter and an Etalon filter to ensure temporal coherence of the field and its coherence time was measured to be $\tau_C = (19 \pm 2)$~ps. The impact of SiPM non-idealities in these kinds of measurements is explored, and we describe the methodology to process SiPM analog waveforms and the event selection used to mitigate these non-idealities.</description>

      <title>Beneath the Surface: Revealing Deep-Tissue Blood Flow in Human Subjects with Massively Parallelized Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) allows the label-free investigation of microvascular dynamics deep within living tissue. However, common implementations of DCS are currently limited to measurement depths of $\sim 1-1.5cm$, which can limit the accuracy of cerebral hemodynamics measurement. Here we present massively parallelized DCS (pDCS) using novel single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays with up to 500x500 individual channels. The new SPAD array technology can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of up to 500 compared to single-pixel DCS, or by more than 15-fold compared to the most recent state-of-the-art pDCS demonstrations. Our results demonstrate the first in vivo use of this massively parallelized DCS system to measure cerebral blood flow changes at $\sim 2cm$ depth in human adults. We compared different modes of operation and applied a dual detection strategy, where a secondary SPAD array is used to simultaneously assess the superficial blood flow as a built-in reference measurement. While the blood flow in the superficial scalp tissue showed no significant change during cognitive activation, the deep pDCS measurement showed a statistically significant increase in the derived blood flow index of 8-12% when compared to the control rest state.</description>
