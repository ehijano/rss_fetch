      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Road-Crossing Decisions by Autonomous Wheelchairs against Environmental Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe road crossing by autonomous wheelchairs can be affected by several environmental factors such as adverse weather conditions influencing the accuracy of artificial vision. Previous studies have addressed experimental evaluation of multi-sensor information fusion to support road-crossing decisions in autonomous wheelchairs. In this study, we focus on the fine-tuning of tracking performance and on its experimental evaluation against outdoor environmental factors such as fog, rain, darkness, etc. It is rather intuitive that those factors can negatively affect the tracking performance; therefore our aim is to provide an approach to quantify their effects in the reference scenario, in order to detect conditions of unacceptable accuracy. In those cases, warnings can be issued and system can be possibly reconfigured to reduce the reputation of less accurate sensors, and thus improve overall safety. Critical situations can be detected by the main sensors or by additional sensors, e.g., light sensors, rain sensors, etc. Results have been achieved by using an available laboratory dataset and by applying appropriate software filters; they show that the approach can be adopted to evaluate video tracking and event detection robustness against outdoor environmental factors in relevant operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Torques with Linear Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of simple observer-based linear feedback policies for "pixels-to-torques" control of robotic systems using only a robot-facing camera. Specifically, we show that the matrices of an image-based Luenberger observer (linear state estimator) for a "student" output-feedback policy can be learned from demonstration data provided by a "teacher" state-feedback policy via simple linear-least-squares regression. The resulting linear output-feedback controller maps directly from high-dimensional raw images to torques while being amenable to the rich set of analytical tools from linear systems theory, alowing us to enforce closed-loop stability constraints in the learning problem. We also investigate a nonlinear extension of the method via the Koopman embedding. Finally, we demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of linear pixels-to-torques policies on a cartpole system, both in simulation and on real-world hardware. The policy successfully executes both stabilizing and swing-up trajectory tracking tasks using only camera feedback while subject to model mismatch, process and sensor noise, perturbations, and occlusions.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended language instructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Robot Library Learning: Bootstrapping Composable and Generalizable Skills for Embodied Control with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for embodied reasoning and control, most recently by generating robot policy code that utilizes a custom library of vision and control primitive skills. However, prior arts fix their skills library and steer the LLM with carefully hand-crafted prompt engineering, limiting the agent to a stationary range of addressable tasks. In this work, we introduce LRLL, an LLM-based lifelong learning agent that continuously grows the robot skill library to tackle manipulation tasks of ever-growing complexity. LRLL achieves this with four novel contributions: 1) a soft memory module that allows dynamic storage and retrieval of past experiences to serve as context, 2) a self-guided exploration policy that proposes new tasks in simulation, 3) a skill abstractor that distills recent experiences into new library skills, and 4) a lifelong learning algorithm for enabling human users to bootstrap new skills with minimal online interaction. LRLL continuously transfers knowledge from the memory to the library, building composable, general and interpretable policies, while bypassing gradient-based optimization, thus relieving the learner from catastrophic forgetting. Empirical evaluation in a simulated tabletop environment shows that LRLL outperforms end-to-end and vanilla LLM approaches in the lifelong setup while learning skills that are transferable to the real world. Project material will become available at the webpage https://gtziafas.github.io/LRLL_project.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Privacy Attacks Against Digital Twin Systems in AI-Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 has witnessed the rise of complex robots fueled by the integration of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. While these technologies offer numerous benefits, they also introduce potential privacy and security risks. This paper surveys privacy attacks targeting robots enabled by AI and DT models. Exfiltration and data leakage of ML models are discussed in addition to the potential extraction of models derived from first-principles (e.g., physics-based). We also discuss design considerations with DT-integrated robotics touching on the impact of ML model training, responsible AI and DT safeguards, data governance and ethical considerations on the effectiveness of these attacks. We advocate for a trusted autonomy approach, emphasizing the need to combine robotics, AI, and DT technologies with robust ethical frameworks and trustworthiness principles for secure and reliable AI robotic systems.</description>

      <title>RAVE: A Framework for Radar Ego-Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation is an essential component of autonomous systems, usually relying on sensor fusion that integrates data from cameras, LiDARs and IMUs. Recently, radars have shown the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of state estimation and perception, especially in challenging environmental conditions such as adverse weather and low-light scenarios. In this paper, we present a framework for ego-velocity estimation, which we call RAVE, that relies on 3D automotive radar data and encompasses zero velocity detection, outlier rejection, and velocity estimation. In addition, we propose a simple filtering method to discard infeasible ego-velocity estimates. We also conduct a systematic analysis of how different existing outlier rejection techniques and optimization loss functions impact estimation accuracy. Our evaluation on three open-source datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed filter and a significant positive impact of RAVE on the odometry accuracy. Furthermore, we release an open-source implementation of the proposed framework for radar ego-velocity estimation accompanied with a ROS interface.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Control of a Novel Closed Chain Five Bar Active Suspension via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary exploration requires traversal in environments with rugged terrains. In addition, Mars rovers and other planetary exploration robots often carry sensitive scientific experiments and components onboard, which must be protected from mechanical harm. This paper deals with an active suspension system focused on chassis stabilisation and an efficient traversal method while encountering unavoidable obstacles. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) was applied along with Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control to stabilise the chassis and traverse large obstacles at low speeds. The model uses the rover's distance from surrounding obstacles, the height of the obstacle, and the chassis' orientation to actuate the control links of the suspension accurately. Simulations carried out in the Gazebo environment are used to validate the proposed active system.</description>

      <title>Manipulate-Anything: Automating Real-World Robots using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale endeavors like RT-1 and widespread community efforts such as Open-X-Embodiment have contributed to growing the scale of robot demonstration data. However, there is still an opportunity to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity of robot demonstration data. Although vision-language models have been shown to automatically generate demonstration data, their utility has been limited to environments with privileged state information, they require hand-designed skills, and are limited to interactions with few object instances. We propose Manipulate-Anything, a scalable automated generation method for real-world robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work, our method can operate in real-world environments without any privileged state information, hand-designed skills, and can manipulate any static object. We evaluate our method using two setups. First, Manipulate-Anything successfully generates trajectories for all 5 real-world and 12 simulation tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods like VoxPoser. Second, Manipulate-Anything's demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations, or from data generated by VoxPoser and Code-As-Policies. We believe \methodLong\ can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <title>RoboUniView: Visual-Language Model with Unified View Representation for Robotic Manipulaiton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for robotic manipulation represents a novel paradigm, aiming to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new objects and instructions. However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 88.7% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 82.4% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Robot Global Localization with Unknown Initial Pose based on Neighbor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot global localization (MR-GL) with unknown initial positions in a large scale environment is a challenging task. The key point is the data association between different robots' viewpoints. It also makes traditional Appearance-based localization methods unusable. Recently, researchers have utilized the object's semantic invariance to generate a semantic graph to address this issue. However, previous works lack robustness and are sensitive to overlap rate of maps, resulting in unpredictable performance in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a data association algorithm based on neighbor constraints to improve the robustness of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three different datasets, indicating a significant improvement in robustness compared to previous works.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Visual-haptic pose estimation in the presence of transient occlusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires the establishment of methods to guarantee the safety of participating operators. A necessary part of this process is ensuring reliable human pose estimation. Established vision-based modalities encounter problems when under conditions of occlusion. This article describes the combination of two perception modalities for pose estimation in environments containing such transient occlusion. We first introduce a vision-based pose estimation method, based on a deep Predictive Coding (PC) model featuring robustness to partial occlusion. Next, capacitive sensing hardware capable of detecting various objects is introduced. The sensor is compact enough to be mounted on the exterior of any given robotic system. The technology is particularly well-suited to detection of capacitive material, such as living tissue. Pose estimation from the two individual sensing modalities is combined using a modified Luenberger observer model. We demonstrate that the results offer better performance than either sensor alone. The efficacy of the system is demonstrated on an environment containing a robot arm and a human, showing the ability to estimate the pose of a human forearm under varying levels of occlusion.</description>

      <title>AddBiomechanics Dataset: Capturing the Physics of Human Motion at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reconstructing human poses in 3D from inexpensive sensors has advanced significantly in recent years, quantifying the dynamics of human motion, including the muscle-generated joint torques and external forces, remains a challenge. Prior attempts to estimate physics from reconstructed human poses have been hampered by a lack of datasets with high-quality pose and force data for a variety of movements. We present the AddBiomechanics Dataset 1.0, which includes physically accurate human dynamics of 273 human subjects, over 70 hours of motion and force plate data, totaling more than 24 million frames. To construct this dataset, novel analytical methods were required, which are also reported here. We propose a benchmark for estimating human dynamics from motion using this dataset, and present several baseline results. The AddBiomechanics Dataset is publicly available at https://addbiomechanics.org/download_data.html.</description>

      <title>Rotation Averaging: A Primal-Dual Method and Closed-Forms in Cycle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of geometric reconstruction, rotation averaging seeks the set of absolute rotations that optimally explains a set of measured relative orientations between them. In addition to being an integral part of bundle adjustment and structure-from-motion, the problem of synchronizing rotations also finds applications in visual simultaneous localization and mapping, where it is used as an initialization for iterative solvers, and camera network calibration. Nevertheless, this optimization problem is both non-convex and high-dimensional. In this paper, we address it from a maximum likelihood estimation standpoint and make a twofold contribution. Firstly, we set forth a novel primal-dual method, motivated by the widely accepted spectral initialization. Further, we characterize stationary points of rotation averaging in cycle graphs topologies and contextualize this result within spectral graph theory. We benchmark the proposed method in multiple settings and certify our solution via duality theory, achieving a significant gain in precision and performance.</description>

      <title>3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter</description>

      <title>Dense Monocular Motion Segmentation Using Optical Flow and Pseudo Depth Map: A Zero-Shot Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion segmentation from a single moving camera presents a significant challenge in the field of computer vision. This challenge is compounded by the unknown camera movements and the lack of depth information of the scene. While deep learning has shown impressive capabilities in addressing these issues, supervised models require extensive training on massive annotated datasets, and unsupervised models also require training on large volumes of unannotated data, presenting significant barriers for both. In contrast, traditional methods based on optical flow do not require training data, however, they often fail to capture object-level information, leading to over-segmentation or under-segmentation. In addition, they also struggle in complex scenes with substantial depth variations and non-rigid motion, due to the overreliance of optical flow. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that leverages the advantages of both deep learning methods and traditional optical flow based methods to perform dense motion segmentation without requiring any training. Our method initiates by automatically generating object proposals for each frame using foundation models. These proposals are then clustered into distinct motion groups using both optical flow and relative depth maps as motion cues. The integration of depth maps derived from state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models significantly enhances the motion cues provided by optical flow, particularly in handling motion parallax issues. Our method is evaluated on the DAVIS-Moving and YTVOS-Moving datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms the best unsupervised method and closely matches with the state-of-theart supervised methods.</description>

Abstract: Safety and stability are essential properties of control systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) have been proposed to ensure safety and stability respectively. However, previous approaches typically verify and synthesize the CBFs and CLFs separately, satisfying their respective constraints, without proving that the CBFs and CLFs are compatible with each other, namely at every state, there exists control actions that satisfy both the CBF and CLF constraints simultaneously. There exists some recent works that synthesized compatible CLF and CBF, but relying on nominal polynomial or rational controllers, which is just a sufficient but not necessary condition for compatibility. In this work, we investigate verification and synthesis of compatible CBF and CLF independent from any nominal controllers. We derive exact necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility, and further formulate Sum-Of-Squares program for the compatibility verification. Based on our verification framework, we also design an alternating nominal-controller-free synthesis method. We evaluate our method in a linear toy, a non-linear toy, and a power converter example.</description>

      <title>Learning Pareto Set for Multi-Objective Continuous Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a control problem with multiple conflicting objectives, there exists a set of Pareto-optimal policies called the Pareto set instead of a single optimal policy. When a multi-objective control problem is continuous and complex, traditional multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms search for many Pareto-optimal deep policies to approximate the Pareto set, which is quite resource-consuming. In this paper, we propose a simple and resource-efficient MORL algorithm that learns a continuous representation of the Pareto set in a high-dimensional policy parameter space using a single hypernet. The learned hypernet can directly generate various well-trained policy networks for different user preferences. We compare our method with two state-of-the-art MORL algorithms on seven multi-objective continuous robot control problems. Experimental results show that our method achieves the best overall performance with the least training parameters. An interesting observation is that the Pareto set is well approximated by a curved line or surface in a high-dimensional parameter space. This observation will provide insight for researchers to design new MORL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything Model for automated image data annotation: empirical studies using text prompts from Grounding DINO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive performance in zero-shot object detection and image segmentation, respectively. Together, they have a great potential in revolutionizing zero-shot semantic segmentation or data annotation. Yet, in specialized domains like medical image segmentation, objects of interest (e.g., organs, tissues, and tumors) may not fall in existing class names. To address this problem, the referring expression comprehension (REC) ability of Grounding DINO is leveraged to detect arbitrary targets by their language descriptions. However, recent studies have highlighted severe limitation of the REC framework in this application setting owing to its tendency to make false positive predictions when the target is absent in the given image. And, while this bottleneck is central to the prospect of open-set semantic segmentation, it is still largely unknown how much improvement can be achieved by studying the prediction errors. To this end, we perform empirical studies on eight publicly available datasets and reveal that these errors consistently follow a predictable pattern and can, thus, be mitigated by a simple strategy. Specifically, we show that these false positive detections with appreciable confidence scores generally occupy large image areas and can usually be filtered by their relative sizes. More importantly, we expect these observations to inspire future research in improving REC-based detection and automated segmentation. Using this technique, we evaluate the performance of SAM on multiple datasets from various specialized domains and report significant improvement in segmentation performance and annotation time savings over manual approaches.</description>

      <title>Think Step by Step: Chain-of-Gesture Prompting for Error Detection in Robotic Surgical Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in robotic systems and surgical data science, ensuring safe and optimal execution in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) remains a complex challenge. Current surgical error detection methods involve two parts: identifying surgical gestures and then detecting errors within each gesture clip. These methods seldom consider the rich contextual and semantic information inherent in surgical videos, limiting their performance due to reliance on accurate gesture identification. Motivated by the chain-of-thought prompting in natural language processing, this letter presents a novel and real-time end-to-end error detection framework, Chain-of-Thought (COG) prompting, leveraging contextual information from surgical videos. This encompasses two reasoning modules designed to mimic the decision-making processes of expert surgeons. Concretely, we first design a Gestural-Visual Reasoning module, which utilizes transformer and attention architectures for gesture prompting, while the second, a Multi-Scale Temporal Reasoning module, employs a multi-stage temporal convolutional network with both slow and fast paths for temporal information extraction. We extensively validate our method on the public benchmark RMIS dataset JIGSAWS. Our method encapsulates the reasoning processes inherent to surgical activities enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art by 4.6% in F1 score, 4.6% in Accuracy, and 5.9% in Jaccard index while processing each frame in 6.69 milliseconds on average, demonstrating the great potential of our approach in enhancing the safety and efficacy of RMIS procedures and surgical education. The code will be available.</description>

      <title>Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation: Bridging Simulation to Reality with Dynamic Human Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to develop embodied agents that navigate based on human instructions. However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</description>

      <title>AeroTraj: Trajectory Planning for Fast, and Accurate 3D Reconstruction Using a Drone-based LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents AeroTraj, a system that enables fast, accurate, and automated reconstruction of 3D models of large buildings using a drone-mounted LiDAR. LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: Recent works have considered two qualitatively different approaches to overcome line-of-sight limitations of 3D sensors used for perception: cooperative perception and infrastructure-augmented perception. In this paper, motivated by increasing deployments of infrastructure LiDARs, we explore a third approach, cooperative infrastructure perception. This approach generates perception outputs by fusing outputs of multiple infrastructure sensors, but, to be useful, must do so quickly and accurately. We describe the design, implementation and evaluation of Cooperative Infrastructure Perception (CIP), which uses a combination of novel algorithms and systems optimizations. It produces perception outputs within 100 ms using modest computing resources and with accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. CIP, when used to augment vehicle perception, can improve safety. When used in conjunction with offloaded planning, CIP can increase traffic throughput at intersections.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor Deception to Deviate from an Allowed Itinerary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a class of deception planning problems in which an agent aims to alter a security monitoring system's sensor readings so as to disguise its adversarial itinerary as an allowed itinerary in the environment. The adversarial itinerary set and allowed itinerary set are captured by regular languages. To deviate without being detected, we investigate whether there exists a strategy for the agent to alter the sensor readings, with a minimal cost, such that for any of those paths it takes, the system thinks the agent took a path within the allowed itinerary. Our formulation assumes an offline sensor alteration where the agent determines the sensor alteration strategy and implement it, and then carry out any path in its deviation itinerary. We prove that the problem of solving the optimal sensor alteration is NP-hard, by a reduction from the directed multi-cut problem. Further, we present an exact algorithm based on integer linear programming and demonstrate the correctness and the efficacy of the algorithm in case studies.</description>

      <title>Cosserat Rod Modeling and Validation for a Soft Continuum Robot with Self-Controllable Variable Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Cosserat rod based mathematical model for modeling a self-controllable variable curvature soft continuum robot. This soft continuum robot has a hollow inner channel and was developed with the ability to perform variable curvature utilizing a growing spine. The growing spine is able to grow and retract while modifies its stiffness through milli-size particle (glass bubble) granular jamming. This soft continuum robot can then perform continuous curvature variation, unlike previous approaches whose curvature variation is discrete and depends on the number of locking mechanisms or manual configurations. The robot poses an emergent modeling problem due to the variable stiffness growing spine which is addressed in this paper. We investigate the property of growing spine stiffness and incorporate it into the Cosserat rod model by implementing a combined stiffness approach. We conduct experiments with the soft continuum robot in various configurations and compared the results with our developed mathematical model. The results show that the mathematical model based on the adapted Cosserat rod matches the experimental results with only a 3.3\% error with respect to the length of the soft continuum robot.</description>

      <title>Robust Pushing: Exploiting Quasi-static Belief Dynamics and Contact-informed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation such as pushing is typically subject to uncertain, non-smooth dynamics. However, modeling the uncertainty of the dynamics typically results in intractable belief dynamics, making data-efficient planning under uncertainty difficult. This article focuses on the problem of efficiently generating robust open-loop pushing plans. First, we investigate how the belief over object configurations propagates through quasi-static contact dynamics. We exploit the simplified dynamics to predict the variance of the object configuration without sampling from a perturbation distribution. In a sampling-based trajectory optimization algorithm, the gain of the variance is constrained in order to enforce robustness of the plan. Second, we propose an informed trajectory sampling mechanism for drawing robot trajectories that are likely to make contact with the object. This sampling mechanism is shown to significantly improve chances of finding robust solutions, especially when making-and-breaking contacts is required. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to synthesize bi-manual pushing trajectories, resulting in successful long-horizon pushing maneuvers without exteroceptive feedback such as vision or tactile feedback. We furthermore deploy the proposed approach in a model-predictive control scheme, demonstrating additional robustness against unmodeled perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>Systematically Exploring the Landscape of Grasp Affordances via Behavioral Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to investigate grasp affordances has received extensive attention over the past several decades. The existing literature provides a robust basis to build upon, though a number of aspects may be improved. Results commonly work in terms of grasp configuration, with little consideration for the manner in which the grasp may be (re-)produced from a reachability and trajectory planning perspective. In addition, the majority of existing learning approaches focus of producing a single viable grasp, offering little transparency on how the result was reached, or insights on its robustness. We propose a different perspective on grasp affordance learning, explicitly accounting for grasp synthesis; that is, the manner in which manipulator kinematics are used to allow materialization of grasps. The approach allows to explicitly map the grasp policy space in terms of generated grasp types and associated grasp quality. Results of numerical simulations illustrate merit of the method and highlight the manner in which it may promote a greater degree of explainability for otherwise intransparent reinforcement processes.</description>

      <title>Image-to-Joint Inverse Kinematic of a Supportive Continuum Arm Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a deep learning-based technique is used to study the image-to-joint inverse kinematics of a tendon-driven supportive continuum arm. An eye-off-hand configuration is considered by mounting a camera at a fixed pose with respect to the inertial frame attached at the arm base. This camera captures an image for each distinct joint variable at each sampling time to construct the training dataset. This dataset is then employed to adapt a feed-forward deep convolutional neural network, namely the modified VGG-16 model, to estimate the joint variable. One thousand images are recorded to train the deep network, and transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques are applied to the modified VGG-16 to further improve the training. Finally, training is also completed with a larger dataset of images that are affected by various types of noises, changes in illumination, and partial occlusion. The main contribution of this research is the development of an image-to-joint network that can estimate the joint variable given an image of the arm, even if the image is not captured in an ideal condition. The key benefits of this research are twofold: 1) image-to-joint mapping can offer a real-time alternative to computationally complex inverse kinematic mapping through analytical models; and 2) the proposed technique can provide robustness against noise, occlusion, and changes in illumination. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cable-Driven Continuum Manipulators (CDCMs) enable scar-free procedures via natural orifices and improve target lesion accessibility through curved paths. However, CDCMs face limitations in workspace and control accuracy due to non-linear cable effects causing hysteresis. This paper introduces an extensible CDCM with a Semi-active Mechanism (SAM) to expand the workspace via translational motion without additional mechanical elements or actuation. We collect a hysteresis dataset using 8 fiducial markers and RGBD sensing. Based on this dataset, we develop a real-time hysteresis compensation control algorithm using the trained Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with a 1ms time latency, effectively estimating the manipulator's hysteresis behavior. Performance validation through random trajectory tracking tests and box pointing tasks shows the proposed controller significantly reduces hysteresis by up to 69.5% in joint space and approximately 26% in the box pointing task.</description>

      <title>Integrating Intent Understanding and Optimal Behavior Planning for Behavior Tree Generation from Human Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots executing tasks following human instructions in domestic or industrial environments essentially require both adaptability and reliability. Behavior Tree (BT) emerges as an appropriate control architecture for these scenarios due to its modularity and reactivity. Existing BT generation methods, however, either do not involve interpreting natural language or cannot theoretically guarantee the BTs' success. This paper proposes a two-stage framework for BT generation, which first employs large language models (LLMs) to interpret goals from high-level instructions, then constructs an efficient goal-specific BT through the Optimal Behavior Tree Expansion Algorithm (OBTEA). We represent goals as well-formed formulas in first-order logic, effectively bridging intent understanding and optimal behavior planning. Experiments in the service robot validate the proficiency of LLMs in producing grammatically correct and accurately interpreted goals, demonstrate OBTEA's superiority over the baseline BT Expansion algorithm in various metrics, and finally confirm the practical deployability of our framework.
