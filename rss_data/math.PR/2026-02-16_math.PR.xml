      <title>Splitting Gibbs Measures for a Periodic Triple Mixed-Spin Ising Model on a Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an Ising model on the Cayley tree $\Gamma_k$ of arbitrary order $k\ge1$ with three spin species of values $(\tfrac12,1,\tfrac32)$ distributed deterministically with period three along the generations. Within the framework of splitting Gibbs measures, we derive the exact boundary-law compatibility equations and characterize translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) via a finite system of algebraic relations. In the ferromagnetic regime $J&gt;0$, writing $\theta=\exp(\beta J/2)$, we further reduce the translation-invariant problem to a one-dimensional scalar fixed-point equation $x=f(x,\theta,k)$ for a rational map $f$. We show that $f$ is strictly increasing and obtain an explicit sufficient condition for phase coexistence: if $s_k(\theta)=f'(1,\theta,k)-1&gt;0$, then $x=f(x,\theta,k)$ admits at least three distinct positive solutions, yielding at least three distinct TISGMs and hence a phase transition driven by the periodic inhomogeneity of the spin structure.
  For the binary tree $k=2$ we exploit attractiveness to construct plus and minus Gibbs measures as weak limits with extremal boundary conditions, prove that they are TISGMs corresponding to the minimal and maximal fixed points of $f(\cdot,\theta,2)$, and show that they are the minimal and maximal Gibbs measures in the natural stochastic order. Finally, we construct the tree-indexed Markov chain associated with a TISGM and apply the Kesten--Stigum criterion to the disordered TISGM, identifying nonempty parameter regions where this measure is non-extremal and reconstruction occurs.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions and sharp Euler--Maruyama approximations for SDEs with Lebesgue--Dini drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strong approximation of stochastic differential equations whose drift is square-integrable in time and Dini continuous in space, while the diffusion coefficient is non-constant and uniformly elliptic. Using a refined It\^{o}--Tanaka trick combined with parabolic regularity estimates, we first establish strong well-posedness and the stochastic flow property. Under additional Lipschitz regularity of the diffusion matrix, we then analyze a polygonal-type Euler--Maruyama scheme and prove the strong error estimate \[ \Big\|\sup_{0\le t\le1}|X_t-X_t^n|\Big\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \le C n^{-\frac12}\log(n)^{\frac32}, \quad p\ge2. \] We further show that this rate is sharp: even under smooth and uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficients with vanishing drift, the convergence order $1/2$ cannot be improved. These results provide the first sharp quantitative strong convergence estimates in a Lebesgue--Dini drift framework.</description>

      <title>About a Ball Removal Process on Bins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following process whereby $n$ balls are distributed into $k$ bins. Repeatedly, a ball is removed from a non-empty bin chosen uniformly at random. The process ends when a single non-empty bin remains. Will Ma (see~\cite[Sec.~1.1]{GS24}) asked whether the initial assignment that minimizes the expected number of remaining balls is one that is as balanced as possible. Using a coupling argument we answer this conjecture positively, and we discuss the case of non-uniform choice among the non-empty bins.</description>

      <title>The condition number of a random banded Toeplitz matrix is typically large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that square matrices with independent and identically distributed (iid) random entries are typically well conditioned. A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>GIG random matrices and a Yang-Baxter extension of the Matsumoto-Yor property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sasada and Uozumi, \cite{SasUoz2024}, identified independence preserving $[2:2]$ quadrirational parametric Yang-Baxter maps, see \eqref{YBEQ}, on $(0,\infty)$. In particular, the map denoted there by $H_{III,B}^{(\alpha,\beta)}$, see \eqref{CS}, was connected to the independence preserving property of the GIG distributions on $(0,\infty)$. Remarkably, the property appears also naturally in probabilistic integrable models of discrete Korteweg de Vries type, as observed by Croydon and Sasada, \cite{CroSas2020}. In the case of $(\alpha,\beta)=(1,0)$ the independence reduces to the classical Matsumoto-Yor property, \cite{MatYor2001}. In \cite{LetWes2024} we proposed an extension of $H_{III,B}^{(\alpha,\beta)}$ to a map on the cone of symmetric positive definite matrices of a fixed dimension, showing that such extended map preserves independence of GIG random matrices. In the present paper we prove two results: (i) the matrix GIG distributions are characterized by the independence property governed by this map; (ii) the matrix variate extension of $H_{III,B}^{(\alpha,\beta)}$ we use, is a parametric Yang-Baxter map.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Dickman distribution and operator selfdecomposability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Dickman distribution arises in various stochastic models across number theory, combinatorics, physics, and biology. Recently, a definition of the multidimensional Dickman distribution has appeared in the literature, together with its application to approximating the small jumps of multidimensional L\'evy processes. In this paper, we extend this definition to a class of vector-valued random elements, which we characterise as fixed points of a specific affine transformation involving a random matrix obtained from the matrix exponential of a uniformly distributed random variable. We prove that these new distributions possess the key properties of infinite divisibility and operator selfdecomposability. Furthermore, we identify several cases where this new distribution arises as a limiting distribution.</description>

      <title>Splitting methods for stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley type systems and a localized fundamental mean-square convergence theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing fundamental theorems for mean-square convergence of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) require globally or one-sided Lipschitz continuous coefficients, while strong convergence results under merely local Lipschitz conditions are largely restricted to Euler-Maruyama type methods. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel localized version of the fundamental mean-square convergence theorem for SDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients, which naturally arise in a wide range of applications. Specifically, we show that if a numerical scheme is locally consistent in the mean-square sense of order $q&gt;1$, then it is locally mean-square convergent with rate $q-1$. Building on this result, we further prove that global mean-square convergence follows, provided that both the exact solution and its numerical approximation admit bounded $2p$th moments for some $p&gt;1$.
  These new convergence results are illustrated on a class of locally Lipschitz SDEs of Hodgkin-Huxley type, characterized by a conditionally linear drift structure. For these systems, we construct different Lie-Trotter and Strang splitting methods exploiting their conditional linearity. The proposed convergence framework is then applied to these schemes, requiring innovative proofs of local consistency and boundedness of moments. In addition, we establish key structure-preserving properties of the splitting methods, in particular state-space preservation and geometric ergodicity. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed splitting schemes significantly outperform Euler-Maruyama type methods in preserving the qualitative features of the model.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of stochastic reacting particle systems with non-local and Lennard-Jones interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish well-posedness results for systems of a finite number of stochastic particles driven by independent Brownian motions and subject to a strongly singular drift induced by a Lennard-Jones interaction. In addition to the pairwise force, the dynamics includes a nonlocal drift mediated by an environmental field, whose evolution is coupled to the particle configuration through a regularized empirical density. We then extend the analysis to a reaction model in which the switching (or killing) rate also depends on the field. An interlacing technique is considered for establishing the well-posedness of the full system. The model is motivated by the challenge to provide a stochastic microscopic description of the sulphation phenomenon in cultural heritage materials.</description>

      <title>Determinant and Pfaffian formulas for particle annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When particles on a line collide, they may annihilate-both are destroyed. Computing exact annihilation probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. The ghost particle method, introduced in a companion paper for coalescence, keeps destroyed particles walking as invisible ghosts that restore the missing dimension. We apply this method to annihilation: when two particles annihilate, both trajectories continue as invisible walkers, yielding an exact determinantal formula that specifies the number of annihilations, where survivors end up, and where ghosts end up. For complete annihilation (no survivors), the formula simplifies to a Pfaffian-an algebraic relative of the determinant built from pairwise quantities-connecting to Pfaffian point process theory. The annihilation formula also yields results about coalescence: pairwise coalescence can be reinterpreted as complete annihilation, producing a Pfaffian coalescence formula. These formulas are exact for any finite initial configuration and apply to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of finite Quasi-Probability and Probability from Principles: The Role of Syntactic Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-probabilities appear across diverse areas of physics, but their conceptual foundations remain unclear: they are often treated merely as computational tools, and operations like conditioning and Bayes' theorem become ambiguous. We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities. We conclude by discussing additional regularity conditions, including the role of rational versus irrational probabilities in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a Sharkovskii-type theorem for a class of discrete random dynamical systems via the random Conley index. Using the continuation property of the Conley index, we extend classical forcing results to random systems obtained from small random perturbations of one-dimensional maps. In contrast to earlier measure-theoretic results, which are typically subject to an inherent period-doubling ambiguity (realizing period $n$ or $2n$), our topological approach allows us to detect random periodic points and orbits with precise minimal periods. This yields realisation results for arbitrary finite tails of the Sharkovskii ordering. These results are illustrated by constructing random periodic orbits for perturbed versions of the tent map and the logistic map.</description>

      <title>Finding Super-spreaders in SIS Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In network epidemic models, controlling the spread of a disease often requires targeted interventions such as vaccinating high-risk individuals based on network structure. However, typical approaches assume complete knowledge of the underlying contact network, which is often unavailable. While network structure can be learned from observed epidemic dynamics, existing methods require long observation windows that may delay critical interventions.
  In this work, we show that full network reconstruction may not be necessary: control-relevant features, such as high-degree vertices (super-spreaders), can be learned far more efficiently than the complete structure. Specifically, we develop an algorithm to identify such vertices from the dynamics of a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process. We prove that in an $n$-vertex graph, vertices of degree at least $n^\alpha$ can be identified over an observation window of size $\Omega (1/\alpha)$, for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$. In contrast, existing methods for exact network reconstruction requires an observation window that grows linearly with $n$. Simulations demonstrate that our approach accurately identifies super-spreaders and enables effective epidemic control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study agents playing a pure coordination game on a large social network. Agents are restricted to coordinate locally, without access to a global communication device, and so different regions of the network will converge to different actions, precluding perfect coordination. We show that the extent of this inefficiency depends on the network geometry: on some networks, near-perfect efficiency is achievable, while on others welfare is strictly bounded away from the optimum. We provide a geometric condition on the network structure that characterizes when near-efficiency is attainable. On networks in which it is unattainable, our results more generally preclude high correlations between outcomes in a large spectrum of dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Graph bootstrap percolation -- a discovery of slowness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph bootstrap percolation is a discrete-time process capturing the spread of a virus on the edges of $K_n$. Given an initial set $G\subseteq K_n$ of infected edges, the transmission of the virus is governed by a fixed graph $H$: in each round of the process any edge $e$ of $K_n$ that is the last uninfected edge in a copy of $H$ in $K_n$ gets infected as well. Once infected, edges remain infected forever. The process was introduced by Bollob\'as in 1968 in the context of weak saturation and has since inspired a vast array of beautiful mathematics. The main focus of this survey is the extremal question of how long the infection process can last before stabilising. We give an exposition of our recent systematic study of this maximum running time and the influence of the infection rule $H$. The topic turns out to possess a wide variety of interesting behaviour, with connections to additive, extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. Along the way we encounter a number of surprises and attractive open problems.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Method for Stochastic Cahn-Hilliard Equation Driven by A Fractional Brownian Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation driven by a fractional Brownian sheet provides a more accurate model for correlated space-time random perturbations. This study delves into two key aspects: first, it rigorously examines the regularity of the mild solution to the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation, shedding light on the intricate behavior of solutions under such complex perturbations. Second, it introduces a fully discrete numerical scheme designed to solve the equation effectively. This scheme integrates the finite difference method for spatial discretization with the tamed exponential Euler method for temporal discretization. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves a strong convergence rate of $O\big(h^{1-\epsilon}+\tau^{H_1-\frac{1}{8}-\frac{\epsilon}{2}}\big)$, where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant, providing a solid foundation for the numerical treatment of such equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is shelf-shuffled exactly one time. One after the other a single card is drawn from the shuffled deck. The guesser makes has guess and the card is shown until no cards remain. We provide a distributional analysis of the number of correct guesses under the optimal strategy. We re-obtain the previously derived expectation and add a complete description of the distribution. We also obtain a central limit theorem for the number $n$ of cards tending to infinity. Furthermore, we discuss an unbalanced, biased shelf shuffle and show how to derive the extend our analysis, also adding the complete position matrix. Finally, a refined analysis of the number of correct guesses is carried out, distinguishing between pure luck guesses and certified correct guesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splines are central objects for the interpolation of discrete data via piecewise smooth paths. Their iterated-integral signature is an infinite collection of tensors which characterizes paths almost uniquely. We study truncations of this collection, which define algebraic maps from parameter space to tensor space. We prove that the images of these maps are given by orbits of a matrix-tensor action. Furthermore, taking the Zariski closure, we define and study varieties of spline signature tensors. We determine dimension and degree of these tensor varieties in a number of examples, relying on symbolic computations. With a view towards learning, constructing paths with a given signature tensor translates to studying the fibers of the signature map. We use computational methods to determine their cardinality, with a focus on its dependence on different classes of splines. We observe in explicit examples that reconstructing splines from a given signature tensor of a path yields close approximations of the original path.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the spectral radius of a large random matrix $X$ with independent, identically distributed complex entries follows the Gumbel law irrespective of the distribution of the matrix elements. This solves a long-standing conjecture of Bordenave and Chafa{\"\i} and it establishes the first universality result for one of the most prominent extremal spectral statistics in random matrix theory. Furthermore, we also prove that the argument of the largest eigenvalue is uniform on the unit circle and that the extremal eigenvalues of $X$ form a Poisson point process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Entropic Martingale Optimal Transport (EMOT) problem on \mathbb{R}. The investigation of the EMOT problem arises in the calibration problem of the Stochastic Volatility Models, where martingale constraints reflect no-arbitrage pricing conditions under the risk-neutral measure, as originally proposed by Henry-Labordere. We first establish the dual formulation of the EMOT problem and prove that Sinkhorn's algorithm achieves an exponential convergence rate under mild conditions. Notably, our analysis does not presuppose the existence of optimal potentials and rigorously confirms the absence of a primal-dual gap. These results provide a theoretical foundation for solving EMOT via Sinkhorn's method and constructing the optimal distribution from dual coefficients.</description>

      <title>Planting and MCMC Sampling from the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the random $d$-regular graph with parameter $\beta&gt;0$. A key difficulty that arises in sampling from the model is the existence of a metastability window $(\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the distribution has two competing modes, the so-called disordered and ordered phases, causing MCMC-based algorithms to be slow mixing from worst-case initialisations.
  To this end, Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins designed a sampling algorithm that works for all $\beta$ when $q$ is large, using cluster expansion methods; more recently, their analysis technique has been adapted to show that random-cluster dynamics mixes fast when initialised more judiciously. However, a bottleneck behind cluster-expansion arguments is that they inherently only work for large $q$, whereas it is widely conjectured that sampling is possible for all $q,d\geq 3$. The only result so far that applies to general $q,d\geq 3$ is by Blanca and Gheissari who showed that the random-cluster dynamics mixes fast for $\beta&lt;\beta_u$. For $\beta&gt;\beta_u$, certain correlation phenomena emerge because of the metastability which have been hard to handle, especially for small $q$ and $d$.
  Our main contribution is to perform a delicate analysis of the Potts distribution and the random-cluster dynamics that goes beyond the threshold $\beta_u$. We use planting as the main tool in our proofs, and combine it with the analysis of random-cluster dynamics. We are thus able to show that the random-cluster dynamics initialised from all-out mixes fast for all integers $q,d\geq 3$ beyond the uniqueness threshold $\beta_u$; our analysis works all the way up to the threshold $\beta_c\in (\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the dominant mode switches from disordered to ordered. We also obtain an algorithm in the ordered regime $\beta&gt;\beta_c$ that refines significantly the range of $q,d$.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalisation of the one-dimensional Rademacher random walk introduced in Bhattacharya and Volkov (2023) to $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (for $d\ge 3$, the Rademacher random walk is always transient, as follows from Theorem 8.8 in Englander and Volkov (2025)). This walk is defined as the sum of a sequence of independent steps, where each step goes in one of the four possible directions with equal probability, and the size of the $n$th step is $a_n$ where $\{a_n\}$ is a given sequence of positive integers. We establish some general conditions under which the walk is recurrent or transient.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the law of the iterated logarithm for a wide class of non-stationary, continuous-time Markov processes evolving on Polish spaces. Specifically, our result applies to certain additive functionals of processes governed by stochastically continuous Markov-Feller semigroups that exhibit exponential mixing and non-expansiveness in the Wasserstein distance, provided that a suitable moment condition involving the initial distribution is satisfied. Furthermore, we outline the application of this result to a Markov process arising as the solution of an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation with dissipative drift and additive noise.</description>

Abstract: We present a multifractal formalism for measures on infinite dimensional metric spaces, in terms of scales instead of dimensions in the classical multifractal analysis. We prove a multifractal formalism with a suitable scaling, called order, for the Wiener measure, which is the probability law of the standard Brownian motion. We also prove the fundamental Frostman Lemma on a large class of Polish spaces, for which the increasing sets lemma holds.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*(\gamma)$, with an explicit function $\alpha^*$ that takes values in $(0,1)$ for all $\gamma\in[0,3)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. The range of admissible $\alpha$ is also extended. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Path Benchmarks for Sequential Probability Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time probability forecasts for binary outcomes are routine in sports, online experimentation, medicine, and finance. Retrospective narratives, however, often hinge on pathwise extremes: for example, a forecast that reaches $90\%$ for an event that ultimately does not occur. Standard pointwise calibration tools (e.g. reliability diagrams) do not quantify how frequently such extremes should occur under correct sequential calibration. Under this ideal, the forecast path $p_k=\Pr(Y=1\mid F_k)$ is a bounded martingale with terminal value $p_N=Y\in\{0,1\}$. We derive benchmark distributions for extreme-path functionals conditional on the terminal outcome, emphasizing the peak-on-loss statistic $M_N=\max_{k\le N} p_k$ given $Y=0$. For continuous-time martingales with continuous sample paths, we obtain an exact identity for $\Pr(\sup_{t\in[0,1]}p_t\ge x\mid Y=0)$. In discrete time, we prove sharp finite-sample bounds and an explicit correction decomposition that isolates terminal-step crossings (non-attainment) and overshoots. These formulas provide model-agnostic null targets and one-sided tail probabilities (exact in the continuous-path setting; conservative in discrete time) for diagnosing sequential miscalibration from extreme-path behavior. We also develop competitive extensions tailored to win-probability feeds, including the eventual loser's peak win probability in two-outcome contests and the eventual winner's trough in $n$-outcome contests. An empirical illustration using ESPN win-probability series for NFL and NBA regular-season games (2018-2024) finds broad agreement with the benchmark in the NFL and systematic departures in the NBA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of a strongly log-concave smooth distribution using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of typical closed geodesics on expander surfaces of high genus, i.e. closed hyperbolic surfaces with a uniform spectral gap of the Laplacian. Under an additional systole lower bound assumption, we show almost every geodesic of length much greater than $\sqrt{g}\log g$ is non-simple. And we prove almost every closed geodesic of length much greater than $g (\log g)^2$ is filling, i.e. each component of the complement of the geodesic is a topological disc. Our results apply to Weil-Petersson random surfaces, random covers of a fixed surface, and Brooks-Makover random surfaces, since these models are known to have uniform spectral gap asymptotically almost surely.
  Our proof technique involves adapting Margulis' counting strategy to work at low length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].
  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>

      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

      <title>Large torus limit of global dynamics of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In order to control the growth of the noise and obtain a priori bounds for solutions independent of the periodicity, we introduce periodic weights and construct weighted function spaces on periodic domains. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>
