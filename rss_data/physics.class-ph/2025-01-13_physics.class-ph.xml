      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic interactions between anisotropic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electrostatic interactions between two charged anisotropic conductors using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. For widely separated particles, we employ the method of reflections to analyze the interactions. Although the formulation applies to conductors of arbitrary shapes, it is specifically implemented for spheroid-sphere systems to capture anisotropy effects in a simple configuration. In near-contact cases with axisymmetric configurations, the lubrication approximation is used to extend the analysis. Additionally, we develop a Boundary Integral Method (BIM) to study particle interactions at arbitrary separations, validating the results with asymptotic solutions for both near and far fields. We derive analytical expressions for the electrostatic force and torque on a spheroid due to another spheroid in the far-field regime. When combined with hydrodynamic effects, the electrostatic torque competes with the hydrodynamically favourable alignments of a pair of settling spheroids in certain regions while reinforcing them in others. Consequently, the inclusion of electrostatic effects may influence the instability observed in dilute suspensions of spheroids.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds on the entropy flow rate and Lyapunov exponents in differentiable dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some microscopic dynamics are also macroscopically irreversible, dissipating energy and producing entropy. For many-particle systems interacting with deterministic thermostats, the rate of thermodynamic entropy dissipated to the environment is the average rate at which phase space contracts. Here, we use this identity and the properties of a classical density matrix to derive upper and lower bounds on the entropy flow rate with the spectral properties of the local stability matrix. These bounds are an extension of more fundamental bounds on the Lyapunov exponents and phase space contraction rate of continuous-time dynamical systems. They are maximal and minimal rates of entropy production, heat transfer, and transport coefficients set by the underlying dynamics of the system and deterministic thermostat. Because these limits on the macroscopic dissipation derive from the density matrix and the local stability matrix, they are numerically computable from the molecular dynamics. As an illustration, we show that these bounds are on the electrical conductivity for a system of charged particles subject to an electric field.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Gravitational Attractions at small Accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational interactions were studied by measuring the influence of small external field masses on a microwave resonator. It consisted of two spherical mirrors, which acted as independent pendulumsindividually suspended by strings. Two identical field masses weremoved along the axis of the resonator symmetrically and periodically betweena near and a far position. Their gravitational interaction altered the distance between the mirrors, changing the resonance frequency, which was measured and found consistent with Newton's law of gravity.
  The acceleration of a single mirror caused by the two field masses at the closest position varied from $5.4 \cdot 10^{-12} m/s^2$ to $259 \cdot 10^{-12}\ m/s^2$.</description>
