      <title>Deep Learning and Explainable AI: New Pathways to Genetic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based AI models have been extensively applied in genomics, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. As these models gain prominence, there exists an urgent need for interpretability methods to establish trustworthiness in model-driven decisions. For genetic researchers, interpretable insights derived from these models hold significant value in providing novel perspectives for understanding biological processes. Current interpretability analyses in genomics predominantly rely on intuition and experience rather than rigorous theoretical foundations. In this review, we systematically categorize interpretability methods into input-based and model-based approaches, while critically evaluating their limitations through concrete biological application scenarios. Furthermore, we establish theoretical underpinnings to elucidate the origins of these constraints through formal mathematical demonstrations, aiming to assist genetic researchers in better understanding and designing models in the future. Finally, we provide feasible suggestions for future research on interpretability in the field of genetics.</description>

      <title>DeepPlantCRE: A Transformer-CNN Hybrid Framework for Plant Gene Expression Modeling and Cross-Species Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of plant transcriptional regulation constitutes a fundamental basis for crop breeding, where cis-regulatory elements (CREs), as the key factor determining gene expression, have become the focus of crop genetic improvement research. Deep learning techniques, leveraging their exceptional capacity for high-dimensional feature extraction and nonlinear regulatory relationship modeling, have been extensively employed in this field. However, current methodologies present notable limitations: single CNN-based architectures struggle to capture long-range regulatory interactions, while existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models demonstrate proneness to overfitting and inadequate generalization in cross-species prediction contexts. To address these challenges, this study proposes DeepPlantCRE, a deep-learning framework for plant gene expression prediction and CRE Extraction. The model employs a Transformer-CNN hybrid architecture that achieves enhanced Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-score metrics over existing baselines (DeepCRE and PhytoExpr), with improved generalization performance and overfitting inhibiting. Cross-species validation experiments conducted on gene expression datasets from \textit{Gossypium}, \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}, \textit{Solanum lycopersicum}, \textit{Sorghum bicolor}, and \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} reveal that the model achieves peak prediction accuracy of 92.3\%, particularly excelling in complex genomic data analysis. Furthermore, interpretability investigations using DeepLIFT and Transcription Factor Motif Discovery from the importance scores algorithm (TF-MoDISco) demonstrate that the derived motifs from our model exhibit high concordance with known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) such as MYR2, TSO1 in JASPAR plant database, substantiating the potential of biological interpretability and practical agricultural application of DeepPlantCRE.</description>
