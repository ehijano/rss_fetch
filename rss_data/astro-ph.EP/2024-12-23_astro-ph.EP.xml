      <title>Observational Signatures of Disk Winds in Protoplanetary Disks: Differentiating Magnetized and Photoevaporative Outflows With Fully Coupled Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized winds and photoevaporative winds are critical in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution. Using 2D axisymmetric (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations with Athena++ implementing fully coupled thermochemistry, we investigate the signatures of the two winds in CO and [C~I] ALMA observations, and examine the potential to distinguish the origins. Our simulations reveal fundamental differences between the two winds: magnetized winds are colder and denser, exhibiting super-Keplerian rotation with small poloidal velocities of $\lesssim 1~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in the atmosphere ($z/R\gtrsim0.45$), while photoevaporative winds are hotter and less dense, exhibiting sub-Keplerian rotation with higher poloidal velocity of several ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$. In addition to previously identified factors like thermal pressure gradient and disk's self-gravity, we demonstrate that magnetic tension/pressure and advection significantly influence rotational velocities of the gas in the wind, which lead to emission patterns that are distinct from Keplerian rotation in synthetic ALMA observations. Magnetized winds are visible in CO channel maps when wind loss rates are $\gtrsim10^{-8}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. When wind loss rates are lower, magnetized winds produce subtle perturbations in channel maps, which resemble the so-called ``velocity kinks'' produced by protoplanets. While photoevaporative winds dissociate CO through strong XUV radiation and thus are weaker in CO, they can create observable ring-like substructures. [C~I] emission is optically thin and could be most effective at detecting both winds in disks with high gas mass and/or high [C~I] abundance. Due to the spatially extended nature of the winds, using a large beam ($\simeq0.4$" for disks in nearby star-forming regions) will be helpful regardless of the tracer used.</description>

      <title>Debiasing of Two-Line Element Sets for Batch Least Squares Pseudo-Orbit Determination in MEO and GEO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in near-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing congestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue remains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources of near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by measurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory, introducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature has shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield significant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this process can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the year. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of the order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track position prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in post-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases are shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error metric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these models. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, post-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to 1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit position error can be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the detection of low-energy M dwarf flares: wavelet-based denoising of CHEOPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using CHEOPS's high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery process to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. Our analysis recovered 349 flares with energies ranging from $2.2\times10^{26}$ to $8.1\times10^{30}$ erg across 63 M dwarfs, with $\sim$40% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising algorithm improved flare recovery by $\sim$34%, though it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.92\pm0.07$, but a log-normal distribution fit better, suggesting multiple flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>The Clear Sky Corridor: Insights Towards Aerosol Formation in Exoplanets Using An AI-based Survey of Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06804</link>

Abstract: Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure. Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes. Surveying 42 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar, novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin (depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across a broader wavelength range.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. It is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal to understand the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains. Additionally, high rotation velocities may rotationally disrupt the grains, which impacts the grain-size distribution. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We modeled the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes were studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parameterization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximum angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs acting on ballistic grain aggregates. To resolve this problem, we propose a new parameterization that predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are most efficient for larger grains with a lower monomer density. Following the constant part, the parameterization has two power laws with different slopes that retain universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength because different drag mechanisms dominate, depending on the grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude. Even though ballistic aggregates have a lower RAT efficiency, strong sources of radiation (stronger than $\approx 100$ times the typical interstellar radiation field) may still produce rotation velocities high enough to cause the rotational disruption of dust grains.</description>
