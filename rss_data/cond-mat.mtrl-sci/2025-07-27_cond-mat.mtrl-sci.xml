      <title>Towards Accurate Thermal Property Predictions in Uranium Nitride using Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined computational and experimental investigation of the thermal properties of uranium nitride (UN), focusing on the development of a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. The MLIP was trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and validated against various quantities including energies, forces, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and defect formation energies, achieving excellent agreement with DFT calculations, prior experimental results and our thermal conductivity measurement. The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which show strong agreement with the MLIP predictions. This work confirms the reliability and predictive capability of the developed potential for determining the thermal properties of UN.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnetic Devil's Staircase-Like Behavior in Quasiperiodic Qubit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The devil's staircase (DS) phenomenon is a fractal response of magnetization to external fields, traditionally observed in periodic ferromagnetic systems, where the commensurability between spin arrangements, lattice parameters, and external magnetic fields governs abrupt changes in magnetization. Its occurrence in aperiodic, fractal-type systems has remained largely unexplored, despite their natural compatibility with such phenomena. Using a quantum annealing device, we uncover a wealth of abrupt magnetic transitions between spin manifolds driven by increasing external magnetic fields within a simple yet effective Ising-model framework. In contrast to periodic systems, where DS arises from long-range competing interactions, our findings reveal that short-range, purely antiferromagnetic couplings in aperiodic geometries produce equally rich ground-state magnetization patterns. We demonstrate that while magnetic textures are determined by the lattice size, their formation remains remarkably robust and independent of scale, with commensurability emerging locally. Our results challenge the prevailing view that DS behavior is limited to periodic systems and establish quasiperiodic geometries as a natural host for this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Mechanical Properties and Thermodynamic Stability of Ti-N system using MTP Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ti-N material system have range of compounds with different stoichiometry like Ti2N, Ti3N2, Ti6N5, Ti4N3 alongwith Ti , TiN and solid solutions of N in Ti with a maximum of 23% solubility. In this work, we develop an interatomic potential based on moment tensor potential (MTP) that could reliably predict mechanical properties and thermodynamic stability of all Ti-N system. Taking into account the structural similarity and dissimilarity of various Ti-N system to choose training dataset was crucial for development of the potential. Root mean square error (RMSE) in prediction of formation energy using MTP potential compared to one calculated using density functional theory (DFT) for training dataset is 2.1 meV/atom and for testing dataset is 6.8 meV/atom. The frequency of absolute error in formation energy peaks at a maximum value of 3.8 meV/atom for system that was part of training dataset, while it peaks at 7.6 meV/atom for systems that are not part of the training dataset. Furthermore, the distribution and variability of elastic constants across compositions are systematically evaluated, revealing trends consistent with DFT benchmarks. The developed potential was used to predict energy of new phases in Ti-N system. We show that structures with N/Ti ratios ranging from 0 to 1 can be thermodynamically stable. A maximum deviation of 10 meV/atom from the convex hull plot of formation energy 0K was observed for a few system.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Heterogeneity of Hydrogen in Metal Hydrides Revealed by Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen plays critical roles in materials science, particularly for advancing technologies in hydrogen storage and phase manipulation, while also posing challenges like hydrogen embrittlement. Understanding its behavior, vital for improving material properties, requires precise determination of atomic-scale distribution-a persistent challenge due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility, as well as the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes these constraints through three key advances: exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolves heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantifies hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work demonstrates MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.</description>

      <title>Pressure-mediated crystalline g-C3N4 with enhanced spatial charge transport for solar H2 evolution and photocathodic protection of 304 stainless steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugated polymeric g-C3N4 has emerged as a leading semiconductor for solar-to-chemical energy conversion due to its unique electronic band structure, robust physicochemical stability, and environmental benignity. However, defect engineering-while effective at enhancing visible-light absorption and charge separation-often introduces excessive dangling bonds and lattice disorder, which exacerbate carrier recombination and impair light harvesting. High crystallinity offers a complementary route to improve spatial charge transport, yet strategies that concurrently optimize crystallinity and surface defects remain underexplored. Here we report a pressure-mediated ion thermal synthesis of high-crystalline g-C3N4 (CCN-P) using a NaCl/KCl eutectic salt under elevated pressure. The molten salt facilitates in-plane and cross-plane crystal growth, while applied pressure reduces interlayer spacing and shortens photocarrier pathways. This dual modulation yields CCN-P with balanced surface defects (-CN and -NHx), an electron-trapping resistance (Rtrap) of 11.36 k{\Omega} cm2 and a photocarrier decay rate constant of 0.013 s-1. CCN-P achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 2168.8 {\mu}mol g-1 h-1 and delivers 78.5% dark photocathodic protection of 304 stainless steel over 7500 s, outperforming bulk and conventionally crystalline g-C3N4. This straightforward pressure-ion thermal approach provides a versatile platform for tailoring crystalline frameworks and defect distributions in polymeric semiconductors for efficient solar energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale confinement of strongly charged 180 degree domain wall pairs in ZrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self organized polar textures can occur in ferroelectric materials across multiple length scales, from nanometer scale vortices and skyrmions, to mesoscopic stripe domains, and macroscopic twin patterns, making these phenomena central to condensed matter physics and nanotechnology. Silicon compatible ferroelectrics such as HfO2 and ZrO2 spontaneously form alternating stacks of two dimensional (2D) polar and nonpolar half unit cell layers, effectively confining dipoles to isolated, single atomic plane layers. However, the arrangement of dipoles within each polar plane is generally considered uniform. Here, by utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO2 film in the plan view orientation, we show that within these irreducibly narrow polar layers, the dipole organization can be strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180 degree domain walls, at most a few unit cells long, alternating between head to head and tail to tail configurations. Head to head and tail to tail walls each adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine the in-plane domains to a sub nm2 footprint, making them one of the smallest domains to be reported in any polar material. This work represents the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls, while being nested within the self organized polar nonpolar layering, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale, and opening new pathways to atomically dense memories and domain wall nanoelectronics in silicon compatible, simple binary oxides.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric and Non-stoichiometric Cesium Potassium Antimonide Photocathodes: Ab-initio Insights into its Properties for Photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-metal antimonides, especially cesium-potassium-antimonide (CsK2Sb), are strong candidates for next-generation photocathodes in linear accelerators due to their low work-function, fast response, high quantum yield, and ability to operate under visible light. In this study, first-principles methods are used to examine the structural, electronic, optical, and surface properties of CsK2Sb relevant to its photoemission performance. Our results for CsK2Sb show strong absorption in the visible range consistent with experimental observations. The computed work-functions for the stable surfaces are significantly lower than the commonly used metallic photocathodes. This material exhibits electron and hole mobilities of 111.86 cm2/Vs and 3.24 cm2/Vs, respectively. Since real materials inherently contain intrinsic defects, we analyze native point defects in CsK2Sb and identified Cs and K vacancies as most likely. These defects introduce mid-gap states, modify the absorption spectrum, and may significantly influence photoemission behavior. This work provides valuable insights into optimizing CsK2Sb for high-efficiency photocathode applications.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Limitations of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Magnetic Systems: A Case Study on Fe-Cr-C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become the gold standard for atomistic simulations, yet their extension to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be captured either explicitly or implicitly. We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD realization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and melting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly estimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters are captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM fails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state: at high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so their explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a transfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on a small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop magnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose potentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole composition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin fluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of freedom into classical force fields.</description>

      <title>All-Dry Transfer of Graphene Film by Van der Waals Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a method that uses van der Waals interactions to transfer continuous, high-quality graphene films from Ge(110) to a different substrate held by hexagonal boron nitride carriers in a clean, dry environment. The transferred films are uniform and continuous with low defect density and few charge puddles. The transfer is effective because of the weak interfacial adhesion energy between graphene and Ge. Based on the minimum strain energy required for the isolation of film, the upper limit of the interfacial adhesion energy is estimated to be 23 meV per carbon atom, which makes graphene/Ge(110) the first as-grown graphene film that has an substrate adhesion energy lower than typical van der Waals interactions between layered materials. Our results suggest that graphene on Ge can serve as an ideal material platform to be integrated with other material systems by a clean assembly process.</description>

      <title>Step-directed Epitaxy of Uni-directional Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Vicinal Ge(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films with precisely controlled thickness are ideal dielectric components to modulate various interfaces in electronic devices. To achieve this, high-quality hBN with controlled atomic configurations must be able to form pristine interfaces with various materials in devices. However, previously reported large-scale hBN films with uniform thickness either are polycrystalline or are not suitable for atomically clean assembly via mechanical exfoliation, limiting their applications in device technology. Here, we report the large-scale growth of monolayer single crystalline hBN films on Ge(110) substrates by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Vicinal Ge(110) substrates are used for the step-directed epitaxial growth of hBN, where Ge atomic steps act as the hBN nucleation sites, guiding the uni-directional alignments of multiple hBN domains. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the optimum hydrogen passivations on both hBN edges and Ge surfaces enable the epitaxial coupling between hBN and the Ge step edges and the single crystallinity of the final hBN films. Using epitaxially grown monolayer hBN films, we fabricate a few hBN films with controlled stacking orders and pristine interfaces through a layer-by-layer assembly process. These films function as high-quality dielectrics to enhance carrier transport in graphene and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channels.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric coupling and its impact on the multicaloric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multicaloric effect, which represents the reversible entropy change that occurs when both external magnetic and electric fields are applied, is an interesting phenomenon characteristic to multiferroics. Targeting the multicaloric effect in the typical multiferroic (Fe$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, we experimentally evaluate the isothermal entropy change due to a magnetoelectric cross-correlation. A pronounced cross-correlation-derived isothermal entropy change is found at the magnetic ordering temperature. By exploring the literature, we suggest that a magnetic phase transition may tend to involve a considerably larger cross-correlation-derived entropy change than that derived from the linear magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Band Gap Predictions: Linking Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW and LDA-Derived Partial Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately calculating band gaps for given crystal structures is highly desirable. However, conventional first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA) fail to predict band gaps accurately. To address this issue, the quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method is often employed as it is one of the most reliable theoretical approaches for predicting band gaps. Despite its accuracy, QSGW requires significant computational resources. To overcome this limitation, we propose combining QSGW with machine learning. In this study, we applied QSGW to 1,516 materials from the Materials Project [https://materialsproject.org/] and used machine learning to predict QSGW band gaps as a function of the partial density of states (PDOS) in LDA. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms linear regression approaches with linearly-independent descriptor generation [https://github.com/Hitoshi-FUJII/LIDG]. This model is a prototype for predicting material properties based on PDOS.</description>

      <title>Stability and Symmetry-Assured Crystal Structure Generation for Inverse Design of Photocatalysts in Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are revolutionizing materials discovery by enabling inverse design-direct generation of structures from desired properties. However, existing approaches often struggle to ensure inherent stability and symmetry while precisely generating structures with target compositions, space groups, and lattices without fine-tuning. Here, we present SSAGEN (Stability and Symmetry-Assured GENerative framework), which overcomes these limitations by decoupling structure generation into two distinct stages: crystal information (lattice, composition, and space group) generation and coordinate optimization. SSAGEN first generates diverse yet physically plausible crystal information, then derives stable and metastable atomic positions through universal machine learning potentials, combined global and local optimization with symmetry and Wyckoff position constraints, and dynamically refined search spaces. Compared to prior generative models such as CDVAE, SSAGEN improves the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of generated structures by 148% and 180%, respectively, while inherently satisfying target compositions, space groups, and lattices. Applied to photocatalytic water splitting (PWS), SSAGEN generates 200,000 structures-81.2% novel-with 3,318 meeting all stability and band gap criteria. Density functional theory (DFT) validation confirms 95.6% structures satisfy PWS requirements, with 24 optimal candidates identified through comprehensive screening based on electronic structure, thermodynamic, kinetic, and aqueous stability criteria. SSAGEN not only precisely generates materials with desired crystal information but also ensures inherent stability and symmetry, establishing a new paradigm for targeted inverse design of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Synergy in Adaptive Active Learning for Continuous Lithium Carbonate Crystallization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.</description>

      <title>Atomically clean free-standing two-dimensional materials through heating in ultra-high vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, free-standing monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\deg}C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\deg}C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.</description>

      <title>Solute Segregation Activates Unconventional Grain Boundary Disconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disconnections, now recognized as key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystals, have traditionally been associated with thermal or mechanical activation. Here, using atomistic simulations across multiple binary alloys (Al-Ni, Al-Fe, etc.), we reveal a distinct disconnection formation mechanism solely activated by interstitial solute segregation. This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with conventional disconnection nucleation. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continued segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections with stable dipoles that resist shear, inducing GB amorphization and sliding rather than conventional shear-coupled motion. The permanent disconnections generate localized stress fields that further drive solute accumulation and, at higher concentrations, facilitate precipitation. These disconnections, unprecedented in pure systems, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed by dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across diverse crystal structures. This work establishes solute segregation as a route for barrier-free disconnection formation, fundamentally altering our understanding of GB kinetics in alloys.</description>

      <title>Equivariant machine learning of Electric Field Gradients -- Predicting the quadrupolar coupling constant in the MAPbI$_3$ phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy combining machine learning and first-principles calculations to achieve highly accurate nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant predictions. Our approach employs two distinct machine-learning frameworks: a machine-learned force field to generate molecular dynamics trajectories and a second model for electric field gradients that preserves rotational and translational symmetries. By incorporating thermostat-driven molecular dynamics sampling, we enable the prediction of quadrupolar coupling constants in highly disordered materials at finite temperatures. We validate our method by predicting the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature of the organic-inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI$_3$, obtaining results that closely match experimental data.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based grand canonical optimization enabled by graph neural networks with fractional atomic existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors have long been theorized to break time-reversal symmetry and support exotic topological features such as Majorana modes and spontaneous edge currents, promising ingredients for quantum technologies. Although several unconventional superconductors may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, clear microscopic evidence of chiral pairing has remained out of reach. In this work, we demonstrate direct real-space signatures of chiral superconductivity in a single atomic layer of tin on Si(111). Using quasiparticle interference imaging, we detected symmetry-locked nodal and antinodal points in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunction, tightly bound to atomic point defects in the tin lattice. These nodal features, along with their surrounding texture, form a distinct real-space pattern exhibiting a clear and exclusive hallmark of chiral superconductivity. Our findings, reinforced by analytical theory and numerical simulations, offer unambiguous evidence of chiral pairing in a two-dimensional material.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum description of the four-wave mixing contribution to correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</description>

      <title>Programmable Exploration of Magnetic States in Lieb-Kagome Interpolated Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware, offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization, and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Topological magneto-optics in the non-coplanar antiferromagnet Co_{1/3}NbS_2: Imaging and writing chiral magnetic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared (400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.</description>

      <title>Antibonding and Electronic Instabilities in GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn): A New Pathway Toward Developing Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical bonding is key to unlocking the potential of magnetic materials for future information technology. Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected nano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based electronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts and their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation remain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to study the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the critical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature of the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding, Fermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become more extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the Gd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy contributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN) vector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors [Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In addition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal some correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction strength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the skyrmions emerge. This work demonstrates how chemical bonding and electronic structure enable a new framework for understanding and developing skyrmions under desired conditions that would otherwise be impossible.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven first-order phase transition of a 2D ionic crystal at the electrode/electrolyte interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes adsorbed at the surface of metallic electrodes display a multitude of structures that can largely differ from the parent bulk system, both in terms of composition and local organization. In particular, the existence of disorder-order or order-order transitions has been increasingly reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy variation during the transition remain insufficiently characterized. To fill this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a prototypical molten salt-metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Pre-ordering effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the formation of a poly-crystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The pre-ordering displays signature of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis proves the first-order character of the transition towards the mono-crystalline state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that sharpens with increasing system size.</description>

      <title>Shape-dependent direction reversal in anisotropic catalytic microswimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propulsion direction of active particles is a key feature in self-propelled systems and depends on the propulsion mechanism and environmental conditions. Here, using 3D micro-printed catalytically active particles, we experimentally show that the propulsion direction can change with increasing fuel concentration when the active particle possesses an anisotropic shape. We find that discs, tori, and bent rods reverse their direction of motion with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration--moving with their inert side forward at low concentrations and with their catalytic side forward at high concentrations. In contrast, spheres and straight rods do not exhibit this reversal. We observe that direction reversal is independent of the base material composition of the swimmer and its size, and only occurs for anisotropic particles where, due to their elongated shape, the location of the solute concentration maximum is unstable and can be shifted by substrate-induced confinements. Our measurements suggest that in addition a change in the platinum-catalyzed reaction of hydrogen peroxide occurs, to which particles with elongated shapes that induce sufficient confinement are more sensitive.</description>

      <title>Efficient integration of self-assembled organic monolayer tunnel barriers in large area pinhole-free magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-transport properties in hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) integrating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as tunnel barriers are critically influenced by spinterface effects, which arise from the electronic properties at ferromagnet (FM)/SAM interfaces. Understanding the mechanisms governing spinterface formation in well-controlled model systems is essential for the rational design of efficient molecular spintronic devices. However, the fabrication of FM/SAM/FM systems remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty in preventing electrical shorts through the SAM tunnel barrier during top FM electrode deposition. In this study, we address these challenges by developing model hybrid MTJs incorporating alkanethiol SAM tunnel barriers grafted under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto single-crystalline Fe(001) bottom electrodes. A soft-landing deposition method is used for the deposition of a top Co FM electrode. The deposition process and the electronic properties of the FM/SAM interfaces are first studied by spatially integrated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) and spectroscopy are used to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the organic barrier. Optimal soft-landing deposition conditions allows the preparation of homogeneous Co/SAM interfaces with no evidence of metal diffusion through the SAM at the nanoscale. These observations are further confirmed at the micron-scale by the high-yield patterning of large area (5*5um2) MTJs presenting fingerprints of electron tunneling through the SAM. These findings provide critical insights into the fabrication and optimization of molecular spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in hybrid MTJ technology.</description>

      <title>From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>T2MAT (text-to-materials): A universal agent for generating material structures with goal properties from a single sentence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC)-content autonomously produced by AI systems without human intervention-has significantly boosted efficiency across various fields. However, AIGC in material science faces challenges in efficiently discovering novel materials that surpass existing databases, while simultaneously addressing the invariance and stability of crystal structures. To address these challenges, we develop T2MAT (text-to-material), a comprehensive agent processing from a user-input sentence to inverse design material structures with goal properties beyond the existing database via globally exploring chemical space, followed by an entirely automated workflow of first-principles validation. Furthermore, we propose CGTNet (Crystal Graph Transformer NETwork), a graph neural network model that captures long-range interactions, to enhance the accuracy and data utilization efficiency of property prediction and thereby strengthen the reliability of inverse design. Through these contributions, T2MAT minimizes the dependency on human expertise and significantly improves the efficiency of discovering novel, high-performance functional materials, offering a robust way toward more autonomous materials design.</description>

      <title>LLM-Feynman: Leveraging Large Language Models for Universal Scientific Formula and Theory Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distilling underlying principles from data has historically driven scientific breakthroughs. However, conventional data-driven machine learning often produces complex models that lack interpretability and generalization due to insufficient domain expertise. Here, we present LLM-Feynman, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside systematic optimization to derive concise, interpretable formulas from data and domain knowledge. Our method integrates automated feature engineering, LLM-guided symbolic regression with self-evaluation, and Monte Carlo tree search to enhance formula discovery and clarity. The embedding of domain knowledge simplifies the formula, while self-evaluation based on this knowledge further minimizes prediction errors, surpassing conventional symbolic regression in accuracy and interpretability. Our LLM-Feynman successfully rediscovered over 90% of fundamental physical formulas and demonstrated its efficacy in key materials science applications, including classification of two-dimensional material and perovskite synthesizability and determination of the Green's function and screened Coulomb interaction bandgaps, and prediction of ionic conductivity in lithium solid-state electrolytes. By transcending mere data fitting through the integration of deep domain knowledge, this LLM-Feynman offers a transformative paradigm for the automated discovery of generalizable scientific formulas and theories across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Performance in solving the Hermitian and pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter equation with the Yambo code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of two strategies in solving the structured eigenvalue problem deriving from the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in condensed matter physics. The BSE matrix is constructed with the \texttt{Yambo} code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing \texttt{Yambo} with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the Hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-Hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-Hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order of 10$^5$.</description>

      <title>Curiosity Driven Exploration to Optimize Structure-Property Learning in Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.</description>

      <title>A High-Quality Thermoelectric Material Database with Self-Consistent ZT Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.</description>

      <title>Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, we find three distinct sets of Weyl crossings under an appropriate symmetry breaking. The first set, composed of four Weyl points, emerges from the Dirac semimetal. Surprisingly, the other two sets result in additional twenty-four Weyl crossings, depending on the weight of the symmetry breaking. We investigate the topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals by computing the Weyl chirality, Berry curvature, and the evolution of Wannier charge centers. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for creating and manipulating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetization dynamics driven by the femtosecond laser pulse of antiferromagnet van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr is studied within time-dependent density functional theory. We investigate the effect of laser fluence as well as the excitation frequency on the ultrafast dynamics of spins. In low fluence, the local magnetic moment of Cr increases when the laser frequency is below the band gap, whereas it decreases when the laser frequency is above the band gap. In high fluence, we find strong demagnetization independent of excitation frequency. We find that the ultrafast demagnetization in CrSBr is dominated by intralayer and interlayer optical intersite spin transfer, and spin flip via the spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role. Our results reveal hole excitation in the low-fluence regime and electron excitation in the high-fluence regime. Further, we investigate the effect of the external static magnetic field on the dynamics. We demonstrate even and odd high harmonic generation in the local magnetic moments and electric current, respectively. The external magnetic field results in an out-of-plane charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect as well as odd harmonics in the local magnetic moment dynamics as a result of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen modes in KDP under pressure from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KDP, we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.</description>

Abstract: The detection of individual charges plays a crucial role in fundamental material science and the advancement of classical and quantum high-performance technologies that operate with low noise. However, resolving charges at the lattice scale in a time-resolved manner has not been achieved so far. Here, we present the development of an electrometer with 60 ns acquisition steps, leveraging on the spectroscopy of an optically-active spin defect embedded in a solid-state material with a non-linear Stark response. By applying our approach to diamond, a widely used platform for quantum technology applications, we can distinguish the distinct charge traps at the lattice scale, quantify their impact on transport dynamics and noise generation, analyze relevant material properties, and develop strategies for material optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <title>Reshaping MOFs text mining with a dynamic multi-agents framework of large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately identifying synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical bottleneck in materials research, as translating literature-derived knowledge into actionable insights is hindered by the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of scientific texts. Here we present MOFh6, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to extract, structure, and apply synthesis knowledge from diverse input formats, including raw literature and crystal codes. Built on gpt-4o-mini and fine-tuned with up to few-shot expert-annotated data, MOFh6 achieves 99% accuracy in synthesis data parsing and resolves 94.1% of complex co-reference abbreviations. It processes a single full-text document in 9.6 seconds and localizes structured synthesis descriptions within 36 seconds, with the cost per 100 papers reduced to USD 4.24, a 76% saving over existing systems. By addressing long-standing limitations in cross-paragraph semantic fusion and terminology standardization, MOFh6 reshapes the LLM-based paradigm for MOF synthesis research, transforming static retrieval into an integrated and dynamic knowledge acquisition process. This shift bridges the gap between scientific literature and actionable synthesis design, providing a scalable framework for accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</description>
