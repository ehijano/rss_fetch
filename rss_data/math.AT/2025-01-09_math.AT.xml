      <title>Lisse extensions of weaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any sheaf theory on schemes extends canonically to Artin stacks via a procedure called lisse extension. In this paper we show that lisse extension preserves the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations: more precisely, the lisse extension of a weave on schemes determines a weave on (higher) Artin stacks. The setup is general enough to apply to the stable motivic homotopy category with the six functor formalism of Voevodsky-Ayoub-Cisinski-Deglise, for instance, and is not specific to algebraic geometry: for example, it also applies to sheaves of spectra on topological stacks.</description>

      <title>Fast Directed $q$-Analysis for Brain Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent innovations in reconstructing large scale, full-precision, neuron-synapse-scale connectomes demand subsequent improvements to graph analysis methods to keep up with the growing complexity and size of the data. One such tool is the recently introduced directed $q$-analysis. We present numerous improvements, theoretical and applied, to this technique: on the theoretical side, we introduce modified definitions for key elements of directed $q$-analysis, which remedy a well-hidden and previously undetected bias. This also leads to new, beneficial perspectives to the associated computational challenges. Most importantly, we present a high-speed, publicly available, low-level implementation that provides speed-ups of several orders of magnitude on C. Elegans. Furthermore, the speed gains grow with the size of the considered graph. This is made possible due to the mathematical and algorithmic improvements as well as a carefully crafted implementation. These speed-ups enable, for the first time, the analysis of full-sized connectomes such as those obtained by recent reconstructive methods. Additionally, the speed-ups allow comparative analysis to corresponding null models, appropriately designed randomly structured artificial graphs that do not correspond to actual brains. This, in turn, allows for assessing the efficacy and usefulness of directed $q$-analysis for studying the brain. We report on the results in this paper.</description>

      <title>On Deformation Theory in Higher Logarithmic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of deformation theory in the context of derived and higher log geometry. After reconceptualizing the "exactification"-procedures in ordinary log geometry in terms of Quillen's approach to the cotangent complex, we construct an "exactified tangent bundle" over the category of log ring spectra. The fibers recover the categories of modules over the underlying ring spectra, and the resulting cotangent complex functor specializes to log topological Andr\'e--Quillen homology on each fiber. As applications, we characterize log square-zero extensions and derive a log variant of \'etale rigidity, applicable to some tamely ramified extensions of ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Real models for the framed little $n$-disks operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.08108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the action of the orthogonal group on the little $n$-disks operads. As an application we provide small models (over the reals) for the framed little $n$-disks operads. It follows in particular that the framed little $n$-disks operads are formal (over the reals) for $n$ even and coformal for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of modules on atomic sites and discrete representations of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish close relations among sheaves of modules on atomic sites, representations of categories, and discrete representations of topological groups. We characterize sheaves of modules on atomic sites as saturated representations, which are precisely representations right perpendicular to torsion representations in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. Consequently, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the Serre quotient of the category of presheaves by the category of torsion presheaves. We also interpret the sheaf cohomology functors as derived functors of the torsion functor and for some special cases as the local cohomology functors. These results as well as a classical theorem of Artin provides us a new approach to study discrete representations of topological groups. In particular, by importing established facts in representation stability theory, we explicitly classify simple or indecomposable injective discrete representations of some topological groups such as the infinite symmetric group, the infinite general or special linear group over a finite field, and the automorphism group of the linearly ordered set $\mathbb{Q}$. We also show that discrete representations $V$ of these topological groups satisfy a certain stability property.</description>

      <title>$O(k)$-Equivariant Dimensionality Reduction on Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets live on high-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $Gr(k, \mathbb{R}^N)$ respectively, and benefit from projection onto lower-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds. In this work, we propose an algorithm called \textit{Principal Stiefel Coordinates (PSC)} to reduce data dimensionality from $ V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in an \textit{$O(k)$-equivariant} manner ($k \leq n \ll N$). We begin by observing that each element $\alpha \in V_n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ defines an isometric embedding of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Next, we describe two ways of finding a suitable embedding map $\alpha$: one via an extension of principal component analysis ($\alpha_{PCA}$), and one that further minimizes data fit error using gradient descent ($\alpha_{GD}$). Then, we define a continuous and $O(k)$-equivariant map $\pi_\alpha$ that acts as a "closest point operator" to project the data onto the image of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ under the embedding determined by $\alpha$, while minimizing distortion. Because this dimensionality reduction is $O(k)$-equivariant, these results extend to Grassmannian manifolds as well. Lastly, we show that $\pi_{\alpha_{PCA}}$ globally minimizes projection error in a noiseless setting, while $\pi_{\alpha_{GD}}$ achieves a meaningfully different and improved outcome when the data does not lie exactly on the image of a linearly embedded lower-dimensional Stiefel manifold as above. Multiple numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data are performed.</description>
