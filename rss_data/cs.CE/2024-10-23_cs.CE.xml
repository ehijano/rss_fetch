      <title>Training an AI hyperelastic constitutive model with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Physics-Augmented Neural network is trained to model a hyperelastic behavior. The dataset used for the training, validation, and test are displacement-force couples obtained from two experiments on a rubber-like material. One experiment was dedicated for the test, to assess the capacity of the model to generalize on unseen loadings and geometries. The trained AI model outperforms a standard Neo Hookean model identified on the same data. Particular attention is paid to the mechanical data information contained in the different datasets.</description>

      <title>A Toolbox for Design of Experiments for Energy Systems in Co-Simulation and Hardware Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In context of highly complex energy system experiments, sensitivity analysis is gaining more and more importance to investigate the effects changing parameterization has on the outcome. Thus, it is crucial how to design an experiment to efficiently use the available resources. This paper describes the functionality of a toolbox designed to support the users in design of experiment for (co-)simulation and hardware tests. It provides a structure for object-oriented description of the parameterization and variations and performs sample generation based on this to provide a complete parameterization for the recommended experiment runs. After execution of the runs, it can also be used for analysis of the results to calculate and visualize the effects. The paper also presents two application cases using the toolbox which show how it can be implemented in sensitivity analysis studies with the co-simulation framework mosaik and a hybrid energy storage experiment.</description>

      <title>MOSAIK 3.0: Combining Time-Stepped and Discrete Event Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-simulation is commonly used for the analysis of complex cyber-physical energy systems (CPES). Different domain-specific simulation tools and modeling approaches are used to simulate all or parts of the system. The co-simulation framework mosaik is a powerful tool to couple these simulation tools and models. This paper identifies the limitations of mosaik 2 for simulating systems that combine continuous and discrete behavior, and introduces the new version mosaik 3.0 with improved event capabilities to efficiently combine time-stepped and discrete event simulation. Here it is explained how these extensions and new features of mosaik can be applied and implemented for extended co-simulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards an Assisted Simulation Planning for Co-Simulation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing complexity in the power system and the transformation towards a smart grid lead to the necessity of new tools and methods for the development and testing of new technologies. One testing method is co-simulation, which allows coupling simulation components from different domains to test their interaction. Because the manual configuration of complex large-scale co-simulation scenarios can be error-prone, we propose an approach for assisting the user in the development of co-simulation scenarios. Our approach uses an information model, a component catalog implemented in a Semantic Media Wiki, and Semantic Web technologies to assist the high-level modeling of co-simulation scenarios, recommend suitable simulation components, and validate co-simulation scenarios. This assistance aims to improve the usability of co-simulation in the development of interdisciplinary, large-scale scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability anti-patterns in Solidity: Increasing smart contracts security by reducing false alarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turing completeness has made Ethereum smart contracts attractive to blockchain developers and attackers alike. To increase code security, many tools can now spot most known vulnerabilities$-$at the cost of production efficiency. Recent studies show false-positive ratios over 99% in state-of-the-art technologies: this makes them impractical for use in industry and have raised questions on the direction of academic research. In this work we show how integrating and extending current analyses is not only feasible, but also a next logical step in smart-contract security. We propose light-weight static checks on the morphology and dynamics of Solidity code, stemming from a developer-centric notion of vulnerability, that we use to verify the output of other tools, flag potential false alarms, and suggest verifications. Besides technical details we implemented an open-source prototype. For three top-10 vulnerabilities it flags 324 warnings of other tools as false-positives, in 60 verified de-duplicated smart contracts selected from the blockchain by the presence of true (and false) vulnerabilities. This amounts to a 92%- to 100%-reduction in the number of false-positives for these vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution Neural Architecture Search for Evolving RNNs in Stock Return Prediction and Portfolio Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock return forecasting is a major component of numerous finance applications. Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight. Results show that using these evolved RNNs and a simple daily long-short strategy can generate higher returns than both the DJI index and the S&amp;P 500 Index for both 2022 (bear market) and 2023 (bull market).</description>

      <title>Towards reproducible machine learning-based process monitoring and quality prediction research for additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have been extensively developed to improve the print quality of additive manufacturing (AM). However, the reproducibility of these systems, as presented in published research, has not been thoroughly investigated due to a lack of formal evaluation methods. Reproducibility, a critical component of trustworthy artificial intelligence, is achieved when an independent team can replicate the findings or artifacts of a study using a different experimental setup and achieve comparable performance. In many publications, critical information necessary for reproduction is often missing, resulting in systems that fail to replicate the reported performance. This paper proposes a reproducibility investigation pipeline and a reproducibility checklist for ML-based process monitoring and quality prediction systems for AM. The pipeline guides researchers through the key steps required to reproduce a study, while the checklist systematically extracts reproducibility-relevant information from the publication. We validated the proposed approach through two case studies: reproducing a fused filament fabrication warping detection system and a laser powder bed fusion melt pool area prediction model. Both case studies confirmed that the pipeline and checklist successfully identified missing information, improved reproducibility, and enhanced the performance of reproduced systems. Based on the proposed checklist, a reproducibility survey was conducted to assess the current reproducibility status within this research domain. By addressing this research gap, the proposed methods aim to enhance trustworthiness and rigor in ML-based AM research, with potential applicability to other ML-based CPSs.</description>

      <title>Finite Operator Learning: Bridging Neural Operators and Numerical Methods for Efficient Parametric Solution and Optimization of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...</description>

      <title>Private Order Flows and Builder Bidding Dynamics: The Road to Monopoly in Ethereum's Block Building Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethereum, as a representative of Web3, adopts a novel framework called Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) to prevent the centralization of block profits in the hands of institutional Ethereum stakers. Introducing builders to generate blocks based on public transactions, PBS aims to ensure that block profits are distributed among all stakers. Through the auction among builders, only one will win the block in each slot. Ideally, the equilibrium strategy of builders under public information would lead them to bid all block profits. However, builders are now capable of extracting profits from private order flows. In this paper, we explore the effect of PBS with private order flows. Specifically, we propose the asymmetry auction model of MEV-Boost auction. Moreover, we conduct empirical study on Ethereum blocks from January 2023 to May 2024. Our analysis indicates that private order flows contribute to 54.59% of the block value, indicating that different builders will build blocks with different valuations. Interestingly, we find that builders with more private order flows (i.e., higher block valuations) are more likely to win the block, while retain larger proportion of profits. In return, such builders will further attract more private order flows, resulting in a monopolistic market gradually. Our findings reveal that PBS in current stage is unable to balance the profit distribution, which just transits the centralization of block profits from institutional stakers to the monopolistic builder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relentless pursuit of technological advancements has ushered in a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) is not only a powerful tool but also a critical economic driver. At the forefront of this transformation is Generative AI, which is catalyzing a paradigm shift across industries. Deep generative models, an integration of generative and deep learning techniques, excel in creating new data beyond analyzing existing ones, revolutionizing sectors from production and manufacturing to finance. By automating design, optimization, and innovation cycles, Generative AI is reshaping core industrial processes. In the financial sector, it is transforming risk assessment, trading strategies, and forecasting, demonstrating its profound impact. This paper explores the sweeping changes driven by deep learning models like Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their potential to foster innovative business models, disruptive technologies, and novel economic landscapes. As we stand at the threshold of an AI-driven economic era, Generative AI is emerging as a pivotal force, driving innovation, disruption, and economic evolution on a global scale.</description>

      <title>DNABERT-S: Pioneering Species Differentiation with Species-Aware DNA Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DNABERT-S, a tailored genome model that develops species-aware embeddings to naturally cluster and segregate DNA sequences of different species in the embedding space. Differentiating species from genomic sequences (i.e., DNA and RNA) is vital yet challenging, since many real-world species remain uncharacterized, lacking known genomes for reference. Embedding-based methods are therefore used to differentiate species in an unsupervised manner. DNABERT-S builds upon a pre-trained genome foundation model named DNABERT-2. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C$^2$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 23 diverse datasets show DNABERT-S's effectiveness, especially in realistic label-scarce scenarios. For example, it identifies twice more species from a mixture of unlabeled genomic sequences, doubles the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering, and outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training. Model, codes, and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/DNABERT_S}.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Economic Impact of Rationality through Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome some of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium assumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded rational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to justify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the capabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that learn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward function. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by extending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that gradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to maximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy. We find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for maximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market competition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent policies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously learn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market power and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational (RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as measured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can come at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable multi-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled and robust direction to extend economic simulators.</description>

      <title>Towards Domain Adaptive Neural Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.</description>
