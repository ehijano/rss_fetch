      <title>Experimental observation of flow instability control by metamaterial subsurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow instabilities within a fluid flow can cause laminar-to-turbulent transition over surfaces. These instabilities can result from upstream, wake-generating disturbances, leading to increased drag and turbulence-induced energy losses. Flow control strategies can address these issues through active methods, requiring energy input, or passive systems, which operate without added input. Here, we present a passive approach to flow control using embedded phononic metamaterials to alter vortex instability development, without changing the outer-surface's texture, roughness or compliance. Experiments confirm that our subsurface can suppress vortex growth at target frequencies, demonstrating the potential for energy-efficient flow management with phononic subsurfaces.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching characteristics of Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the study of resistive switching devices, researchers have found that the influence of the insertion layer cannot be ignored. Many reports have confirmed that the appropriate insertion layer can significantly improve the performance of the resistive switching devices. Therefore, in this work, we use magnetron sputtering to fabricate three devices: Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu. Through the characterization test of each device and the measurement of the I-V curve, it is found that the resistive switching characteristics of the Cu/MgO/Cu device will change greatly after adding an MoS2 insertion layer. The analysis results show that the inserted MoS2 layer does not change the main transmission mechanism (space charge limited conduction) of the device, but affects the regulating function of interfacial potential barrier, the effect also is related to the location of MoS2 inserted into the layer. Among the Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu devices, the Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu device exhibits a larger switching ratio (about 103) and a lower reset voltage (about 0.21 V), which can be attributed to the regulation of the interface barrier between MgO and MoS2. In addition, when the MoS2 layer is inserted between the bottom electrodes Cu and MgO, the leakage current of the device is significantly reduced. Therefore, Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu device has the highest commercial value from the point of view of practical applications. Finally, according to the XPS results and XRD results, we establish the conductive filament models for the three devices, and analyze the reasons for the different resistive switching characteristics of the three devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate an irradiated NbN SNSPD exhibiting a well-defined saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by irradiation-induced modifications and an avalanche-assisted detection mechanism with weak wavelength dependence. Our findings provide valuable insights into ion irradiation as a post-processing technique for SNSPDs, offering a pathway to enhancing IDE and tailoring thermal properties. This work also advances the understanding of SNSPD physics and defect engineering in superconducting thin films, expanding the potential applications of irradiation techniques in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>High Numerical Aperture Achromatic Meta-Devices through Dispersion Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion engineering is a long-standing challenge in optical systems, and it is particularly important for metasurfaces, which naturally suffer from strong chromatic aberrations due to their ultralow profile. Stacks of metasurfaces have recently implemented dispersion control to address these challenges. However, these approaches still suffer from bottlenecks in terms of the available material refractive index and required aspect ratios, resulting in limited phase and group delay coverage, constraining their numerical aperture (NA), size and operating bandwidth. To address these challenges, we explore a dispersion compensation strategy combined with full-wave simulation-free inverse design to implement ultra-high NA, broadband dispersion control in metasurfaces, not requiring large refractive index materials and high aspect ratio processing technology. We experimentally demonstrate multiple meta-devices with highly customized dispersion engineering in the microwave regime, including broadband achromatic diffraction-limited meta-devices with NA=0.98 and 60% fractional bandwidth. Our proposed platform explores a paradigm for dispersion control with metasurfaces, which may facilitate advanced and scalable dispersion functionalities.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter butterflies in phononic structures: commensurate spectra, wave localization and metal-insulator transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new simple and easy-to-implement one-dimensional phononic system whose spectrum exactly corresponds to the Hofstadter butterfly when a parameter is modulated. The system consists of masses that are coupled by linear springs and are mounted on flexural beams whose cross section (and, hence, stiffness) is modulated. We show that this system is the simplest version possible to achieve the Hofstadter butterfly exactly; in particular, the local resonances due to the beams are an essential component for this. We examine the various approaches to producing spectral butterflies, including Bloch spectra for rational parameter choices, resonances of finite-sized systems and transmission coefficients of sections of finite length. For finite-size systems, we study the localisation of the modes by calculating the inverse participation ratio, and detect a phase transition characterised by a critical value of the stiffness modulation amplitude, where the state of the system changes from mainly extended to localised, corresponding to a metal-insulator phase transition. The obtained results offer a practical strategy to realize experimentally a system with similar dynamical properties. The transmission coefficient for sections of finite length is benchmarked through the comparison with Bloch spectra of the same finite-sized systems. The numerical results for the transmission spectra confirms the evidence of a phase transition in the dynamical state of the system. Our approach opens significant new perspectives in order to design mechanical systems able to support phase transitions in their vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>Lateral Cavity-Enhanced Guided Mode Resonance Structures for Mid-wave Infrared Photodetector Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of ultra-compact mid-wave infrared photodetector pixels. Our design relies on a guided mode resonance structure to confine incident mid-infrared light to the 250 nm-thick absorber region of all-epitaxially-grown material stack, and a hybrid cavity-guided mode resonance to confine the mode in the lateral direction. The resulting pixel, with deep subwavelength thickness and lateral dimensions on the order of almost two times free space operating wavelength is predicted to achieve external quantum efficiency of the order of 50%. Our work opens the door for truly compact mid-wave infrared pixels that offer the combined benefits of low dark current, room temperature operation, and small lateral size.</description>

      <title>A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically conductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional layer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact with the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple low-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the resistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's quantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the graphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte properties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases, do not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor miniaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker detection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

Abstract: The Stirling engine is a type of heat engine known as its high efficiency. It is applied in solar thermal power, cogeneration, space nuclear power, and other fields. Although there are many different types of Stirling engines, their airflow paths are always linear. This article designs two types of Stirling engines with loop airflow path: the O-type engines without regenerator and the 8-type engines with regenerator. The modeling and simulation of the O-type engines show its excellent performance compared with the conventional Stirling engine. At the same time, its design without regenerator makes it more practical and has greater potential in terms of power. The 8-type engines use its unique 8-type airflow path to allow gas to enter the regenerator in advance, eliminating the almost useless four heat exchanges, resulting in higher thermal efficiency and better robustness.</description>

      <title>Localized tension-induced giant folding in unstructured elastic sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from `groovy metasheets' for multi-stable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counter-intuitive behavior -- a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension -- occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as `localized TUG folding' to reflect the importance of localized tension and its mode of actuation. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression -- a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Polarization Decoupling Multi-Port Beam-Splitting Metasurface for Miniaturized Magneto-Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In regular magneto-optical trap (MOT) systems, the delivery of six circularly polarized (CP) cooling beams requires complex and bulky optical arrangements including waveplates, mirrors, retroreflectors, etc. To address such technique challenges, we have proposed a beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT entirely based on meta-devices. The key component is a novel multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.29%~93.15%). By leveraging such beam-splitting device as well as reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application has been implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration and large overlapping volume (76.2 mm^3). We believe that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation and computing, etc.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>
