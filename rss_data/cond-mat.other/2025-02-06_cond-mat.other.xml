      <title>Luminescence thermometry based on photon emitters in nanophotonic silicon waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable measurement and accurate control of the temperature within nanophotonic devices is a key prerequisite for their application in both classical and quantum technologies. Established approaches use sensors that are attached in proximity to the components, which only offers a limited spatial resolution and thus impedes the measurement of local heating effects. Here, we therefore study an alternative temperature sensing technique that is based on measuring the luminescence of erbium emitters directly integrated into nanophotonic silicon waveguides. To cover the entire temperature range from 295 K to 2 K, we investigate two different approaches: The thermal activation of non-radiative decay channels for temperatures above 200 K and the thermal depopulation of spin- and crystal field levels at lower temperatures. The achieved sensitivity is 0.22(4) %/K at room temperature and increases up to 420(50) %/K at approximately 2 K. Within a few-minute measurement interval, we thus achieve a measurement precision that ranges from 0.04(1) K at the lowest studied temperature to 6(1) K at ambient conditions. In the future, the measurement time can be further reduced by optimizing the excitation pulse sequence and the fiber-to-chip coupling efficiency. Combining this with spatially selective implantation promises precise thermometry from ambient to cryogenic temperatures with a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers.</description>

      <title>Searching for fixed points of dynamical systems by the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being able to effectively locate saddle (and other fixed) points in dynamical systems holds tremendous implications in a number of applications in engineering and science, among which the study of rare events in molecular simulations stands as one of the most prominent field of interest. Although there is a vast literature on methods aiming at addressing this challenge, open issues still remain in several aspects such as computational efficiency and easy implementation. In this work, we suggest that the Relaxation Redistribution Method (RRM) - formerly introduced to solve the invariance equation in the context of stiff dynamical systems ruling detailed chemical kinetics - can be reformulated to locate saddle and other fixed points even for stochastic simulators driven by effective energy gradients. This new formulation of the RRM is referred to as the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method (ERRM). Benchmarks based on the popular Mueller-Brown and other potentials are used to test the ERRM.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges, $e$, controlled with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-8}$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never demonstrated such an accuracy for a net flow. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty in the milliampere range, but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections. Here, we present a new programmable quantum current generator, which combines both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier in a quantum electrical circuit enabling the current scaling without errors. Thanks to a full quantum instrumentation, we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated currents, in the microampere range, at quantized values, $\pm(n/p)ef_\mathrm{J}$, with relative uncertainties less than $10^{-8}$, where $n$ and $p$ are integer control parameters and $f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency. This experiment sets the basis of a universal quantum realization of the electrical units, for example able of improving high-value resistance measurements and bridging the gap with other quantum current sources.</description>
