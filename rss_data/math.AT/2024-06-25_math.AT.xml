      <title>Integral Betti signature confirms the hyperbolic geometry of brain, climate, and financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the possibility to examine the underlying curvature of data through the lens of topology by using the Betti curves, tools of Persistent Homology, as key topological descriptors, building on the clique topology approach. It was previously shown that Betti curves distinguish random from Euclidean geometric matrices - i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed in a cube with Euclidean distance. In line with previous experiments, we consider their low-dimensional approximations named integral Betti values, or signatures that effectively distinguish not only Euclidean, but also spherical and hyperbolic geometric matrices, both from purely random matrices as well as among themselves. To prove this, we analyse the behaviour of Betti curves for various geometric matrices -- i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed on manifolds of constant sectional curvature, considering the classical models of curvature 0, 1, -1, given by the Euclidean space, the sphere, and the hyperbolic space. We further investigate the dependence of integral Betti signatures on factors including the sample size and dimension. This is important for assessment of real-world connectivity matrices, as we show that the standard approach to network construction gives rise to (spurious) spherical geometry, with topology dependent on sample dimensions. Finally, we use the manifolds of constant curvature as comparison models to infer curvature underlying real-world datasets coming from neuroscience, finance and climate. Their associated topological features exhibit a hyperbolic character: the integral Betti signatures associated to these datasets sit in between Euclidean and hyperbolic (of small curvature). The potential confounding ``hyperbologenic effect'' of intrinsic low-rank modular structures is also evaluated through simulations.</description>

      <title>A Deligne conjecture for prestacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the Deligne conjecture for prestacks. We show that given a prestack $\mathbb A$, its Gerstenhaber--Schack complex $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$ is naturally an $E_2$-algebra. This structure generalises both the known $\mathsf{L}_\infty$-algebra structure on $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$, as well as the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on its cohomology $\mathbf{H}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$. The main ingredient is the proof of a conjecture of Hawkins \cite{hawkins}, stating that the homology of the dg operad $\mathsf{Quilt}$ has vanishing homology in positive degrees. As a corollary, $\Quilt$ is quasi-isomorphic to the operad $\mathsf{Brace}$ encoding brace algebras. In addition, we improve the $L_\infty$-structure on $\Quilt$ be showing that it originates from a $\mathsf{PreLie}_\infty$-structure lifting the $\mathsf{PreLie}$-structure on $\mathsf{Brace}$ in homology.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>

      <title>A Topology Scavenger Hunt to Introduce Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology at the undergraduate level is often a theoretical mathematics course, introducing concepts from point-set topology or possibly algebraic topology. However, the last two decades have seen an explosion of growth in applied topology and topological data analysis, which are topics that can be presented in an accessible way to undergraduate students and can encourage exciting projects. For the past several years, the Topology course at Macalester College has included content from point-set and algebraic topology, as well as applied topology, culminating in a project chosen by the students. In the course, students work through a topology scavenger hunt as an activity to introduce the ideas and software behind some of the primary tools in topological data analysis, namely, persistent homology and mapper. This scavenger hunt includes a variety of point clouds of varying dimensions, such as an annulus in 2D, a bouquet of loops in 3D, a sphere in 4D, and a torus in 400D. The students' goal is to analyze each point cloud with a variety of software to infer the topological structure. After completing this activity, students are able to extend the ideas learned in the scavenger hunt to an open-ended capstone project. Examples of past projects include: using persistence to explore the relationship between country development and geography, to analyze congressional voting patterns, and to classify genres of a large corpus of texts by combining with tools from natural language processing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>MOUNTAINEER: Topology-Driven Visual Analytics for Comparing Local Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of black-box Machine Learning (ML) techniques in critical applications, there is a growing demand for methods that can provide transparency and accountability for model predictions. As a result, a large number of local explainability methods for black-box models have been developed and popularized. However, machine learning explanations are still hard to evaluate and compare due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, varying scales, and stochastic nature of some of these methods. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can be an effective method in this domain since it can be used to transform attributions into uniform graph representations, providing a common ground for comparison across different explanation methods.
  We present a novel topology-driven visual analytics tool, Mountaineer, that allows ML practitioners to interactively analyze and compare these representations by linking the topological graphs back to the original data distribution, model predictions, and feature attributions. Mountaineer facilitates rapid and iterative exploration of ML explanations, enabling experts to gain deeper insights into the explanation techniques, understand the underlying data distributions, and thus reach well-founded conclusions about model behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Mountaineer through two case studies using real-world data. In the first, we show how Mountaineer enabled us to compare black-box ML explanations and discern regions of and causes of disagreements between different explanations. In the second, we demonstrate how the tool can be used to compare and understand ML models themselves. Finally, we conducted interviews with three industry experts to help us evaluate our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the standard comparison used by mathematicians between the idempotent complete pretriangulated dg-categories, over a unitary and commutative ring $k$, and the idempotent complete $k$-linear stable $\infty$-categories. Our approach is completely included in the $\infty$-categorical theory. To achieve the target we will reinterpret the Morita theory for dg-categories and we set the Morita theory for $k$-linear stable $\infty$-category.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Examples of \'etale extensions of Green functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new examples of \'etale extensions of Green functors by transferring classical examples of \'etale extensions to the equivariant setting. Our examples are Tambara functors, and we prove Green \'etaleness for them, which implies Tambara \'etaleness. We show that every $C_2$-Galois extensions of fields gives rise to an \'etale extension of $C_2$-Green functors. Here we associate the constant Tambara functor to the base field and the fix-Tambara functor to the extension. We also prove that all $C_n$-Kummer extensions give rise to \'etale extensions for arbitrary finite $n$. \'Etale extensions of fields induce \'etale extension of $G$-Green functors for any finite group $G$ by passing to the corresponding constant $G$-Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard diffeology and generalized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17203v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstandard extension of the category of diffeological spaces, and demonstrate its application to the study of generalized functions. Just as diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of Euclidean open sets, our nonstandard diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of open subsets of nonstandard Euclidean spaces, i.e. finite dimensional vector spaces over (the quasi-asymptotic variant of) Robinson's hyperreal numbers. It is shown that nonstandard diffeological spaces form a category which is enriched over the category of diffeological spaces, is closed under small limits and colimits, and is cartesian closed. Furthermore, it can be shown that the space of nonstandard functions on the extension of a Euclidean open set is a smooth differential algebra that admits an embedding of the differential vector space of Schwartz distributions. Since our algebra of generalized functions comes as a hom-object in a category, it enables not only the multiplication of distributions but also the composition of them. To illustrate the usefulness of this property we show that the homotopy extension property can be established for smooth relative cell complexes by exploiting extended maps.</description>
