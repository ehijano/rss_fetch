      <title>Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly restrictive time step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting their efficiency at high orders. In this paper, we introduce a novel locally implicit, but globally explicit ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively captures the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear test cases.</description>

      <title>Phase space geometry of a Four-wings chaotic attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well known butterfly effect got its nomenclature from its two wings geometrical structure in phase space. There are chaotic dynamics from simple one-wing to multiple-wings complex structures in phase space. In this communication we demonstrate, both with direct numerical solutions and using Nambu mechanics, how does a four-wings complex structure in the phase space arise for a chaotic dynamical system. We further explore the properties of these structures and demonstrate that an attractor is produced out of dynamical intersections of Hamiltonian kind of Nambu functions. We also find, analytically, the specific conditions on system parameters for the formation of localized region of an attractor.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>Robust Lindbladian Estimation for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</description>

      <title>FeynKrack: A continuum model for quasi-brittle damage through Feynman-Kac killed diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is a popular framework for modelling crack propagation in solids. The CDM uses a damage parameter to quantitatively assess what one loosely calls `material degradation'. While this parameter is sometimes given a physical meaning, the mathematical equations for its evolution are generally not consistent with such physical interpretations. Curiously, degradation in the CDM may be viewed as a change of measures, wherein the damage variable appears as the Radon-Nikodym derivative. We adopt this point of view and use a probabilistic measure-valued description for the random microcracks underlying quasi-brittle damage. We show that the evolution of the underlying density may be described via killed diffusion as in the Feynman-Kac theory. Damage growth is then interpreted as the reduction in this measure over a region, which in turn quantifies the disruption of bonds through a loss of force-transmitting mechanisms between nearby material points. Remarkably, the evolution of damage admits an approximate closed-form solution. This brings forth substantive computational ease, facilitating fast yet accurate simulations of large dimensional problems. By selecting an appropriate killing rate, one accounts for the irreversibility of damage and thus eliminates the need for ad-hoc history-dependent routes typically employed, say, in phase field modelling of damage. Our proposal FeynKrack (a short form for Feynman-Kac crack propagator) is validated and demonstrated for its efficacy through several simulations on quasi-brittle damage. It also offers a promising stochastic route for future explorations of non-equilibrium thermodynamic aspects of damage.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based multilevel Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Electron Ptychography Reveals Correlated Lattice Vibrations at Atomic Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an electron ptychography reconstruction framework, CAVIAR -- Correlated Atomic Vibration Imaging with sub-Angstrom Resolution -- that reveals an entirely new channel of information: spatial correlations in atomic displacements at the atomic scale. We show reconstructions of a symmetric $\Sigma$9 grain boundary in silicon from realistically simulated data and experimental data for hexagonal boron nitride. By reconstructing the object as an ensemble of multiple states we are able to observe correlations between movements of atoms in the range of 10-20 pm at room temperature in agreement with the expectation. Moreover, using only the masses of the atomic species and the temperature as input, we obtain average frequencies of $10.8\pm0.1$, $13.6\pm0.6$, $18.0\pm0.2$, $25.5\pm1.5$ THz for the longitudinal and transversal acoustic and optic phonons, respectively, in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering, albeit from just a few nm$^3$ volume. This ability to spatially resolve correlated atomic motion makes CAVIAR a unique tool to explore atom dynamics at the finest scale with the potential to be instrumental in the development of phononic devices, in studying phonon-based decoherence in quantum systems, or other emerging phonon-based applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We show one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Regression for conformer ensembles made easy with Structured Orthogonal Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient protocol for machine learning in chemical space using Boltzmann ensembles of conformers as input is proposed; the method is based on rewriting Kernel Ridge Regression expressions in terms of Structured Orthogonal Random Features, yielding physics-motivated trigonometric neural networks. To evaluate the method's utility for materials discovery, we test it on experimental datasets of two quantities related to battery electrolyte design, namely oxidation potentials in acetonitrile and hydration energies, using several popular molecular representations to demonstrate the method's flexibility. Despite only using computationally cheap forcefield calculations for conformer generation, we observe systematic decrease of machine learning error with increased training set size in all cases, with experimental accuracy reached after training on hundreds of molecules and prediction errors being comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. We also present novel versions of Huber and LogCosh loss functions that made hyperparameter optimization of the new approach more convenient.</description>
