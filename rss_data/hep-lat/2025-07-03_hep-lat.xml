      <title>Phases of Tree-decorated Dynamical Triangulations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to triple-tree phase transition is continuous.</description>

      <title>String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.</description>

      <title>The principle of least action for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.</description>

      <title>A modified Cayley transform for SU(3) molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR" to model the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\xi)$ at $\xi=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>
