      <title>Bridging Simulations of Kink Instability in Relativistic Magnetized Jets with Radio Emission and Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic outflows emanating from active galactic nuclei can extend up to kiloparsec scales in length, displaying a variety of complex morphologies. This study explores the intricate morphologies of such relativistic jets, mainly focusing on creating a bridge between magnetic instabilities in jets with observational signatures from complex radio galaxies. In particular, we aim to study the role of dynamical instabilities in forming distinctive morphological features by employing 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations of rotating jets. Our simulations have further used the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework of the PLUTO code and generated the synthetic synchrotron emission and polarisation maps to compare with the observed signatures. Our analysis based on simulations of a continuously injected jet suggests that current-driven instabilities, notably the $|m|=1$ mode, generate rib-like structures that are seen in some of the recent radio galaxies using MeerKat, e.g. MysTail. In our contrasting simulations of the restarted jet, the kink-instability driven rib-like structures were formed relatively near the nozzle. In both cases, the jet dissipates its pre-existing magnetic energy through these instabilities, transitioning to a more kinetic energy dominant state. The turbulent structures resulting from this dissipation phase are filamentary and resemble the tethers as observed for the case of MysTail. This pilot study essentially provides a plausible qualitative explanation by bridging simulations of kink instability to produce synthetic radio features resembling the observed complex radio morphology of MysTail.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Multi-Dimensional Pair Production Discharges in Polar Caps of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first self-consistent multidimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations of non-homogeneous pair discharges in polar caps of rotation-powered pulsars. By introducing strong inhomogeneities in the initial plasma distribution in our simulations, we analyze the degree of self-consistently emerging coherence of discharges across magnetic field lines. In 2D, we study discharge evolution for a wide range of physical parameters and boundary conditions corresponding to both the absent and free escape of charged particles from the surface of a neutron star. We also present the results of the first 3D simulations of discharges in a polar cap with a distribution of the global magnetospheric current appropriate for a pulsar with $60^{\circ}$ inclination angle. For all parameters, we find the coherence scale of pair discharges across magnetic field lines to be of the order of gap height. We also demonstrate that the popular "spark" model of pair discharges is incompatible with the universally adopted force-free magnetosphere model: intermittent discharges fill the entire zone of the polar cap that allows pair cascades, leaving no space for discharge-free regions. Our findings disprove the key assumption of the spark model about the existence of isolated distinct discharge columns.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <title>Testing Bayesian inference of GRMHD model parameters from VLBI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) of supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* offer valuable insights into their spacetime properties and astrophysical conditions. Utilizing a library of model images (~2 million for Sgr A*) generated from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, limited and coarse insights on key parameters such as black hole spin, magnetic flux, inclination angle, and electron temperature were gained. The image orientation and black hole mass estimates were obtained via a scoring and an approximate rescaling procedure. Lifting such approximations, probing the space of parameters continuously, and extending the parameter space of theoretical models is both desirable and computationally prohibitive with existing methods. To address this, we introduce a new Bayesian scheme that adaptively explores the parameter space of ray-traced, GRMHD models. The general relativistic radiative transfer code \ipole is integrated with the EHT parameter estimation tool THEMIS. The pipeline produces a ray-traced model image from GRMHD data, computes predictions for VLBI observables from the image for a specific VLBI array configuration and compares to data thereby sampling the likelihood surface via an MCMC scheme. At this stage we focus on four parameters: accretion rate, electron thermodynamics, inclination, and source position angle. Our scheme faithfully recovers parameters from simulated VLBI data and accommodates time-variabibility via an inflated error budget. We highlight the impact of intrinsic variability on model fitting approaches. This work facilitates more informed inferences from GRMHD simulations and enables expansion of the model parameter space in a statistically robust and computationally efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Indications of magnetic accretion in Swift J0826.2-7033</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our findings from the first long X-ray observation of the hard X-ray source Swift J0826.2-7033 with XMM-Newton, which has shown characteristics of magnetic accretion. The system appears to have a long orbital period (~7.8 h) accompanied by short timescale variabilities, which we tentatively interpret as the spin and beat periods of an intermediate polar. These short- and long-timescale modulations are energy-independent, suggesting that photoelectric absorption does not play any role in producing the variabilities. If our suspected spin and beat periods are true, then Swift J0826.2-7033 accretes via disc-overflow with an equal fraction of accretion taking place via disc and stream. The XMM-Newton and Swift-BAT spectral analysis reveals that the post-shock region in Swift J0826.2-7033 has a multi-temperature structure with a maximum temperature of ~43 keV, which is absorbed by a material with an average equivalent hydrogen column density of ~1.6$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ that partially covers ~27% of the X-ray source. The suprasolar abundances, with hints of an evolved donor, collectively make Swift J0826.2-7033 an interesting target, which likely underwent a thermal timescale mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch - A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova \sn, exploded at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$, in NGC~3206. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model of the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than the H recombination and radioactive decays. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN~2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5$\msun~surrounded by an extended envelope of only 0.2\msun~with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of 0.048\msun. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of \ion{He}{II} Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.</description>

      <title>Minimum gas mass accreted by spinning intermediate-mass black holes in stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) growing through repeated black hole mergers in stellar clusters statistically asymptotes to zero. Putative observations of IMBHs with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$ would require a phase of coherent gas accretion to spin up the black hole. We estimate the amount of gas necessary to produce a given IMBH spin. If the observed IMBH mass and spin are $M\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ and $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$, respectively, the IMBH must have coherently accreted at least $\sim 100~M_\odot$ of gas. In this scenario, as long as the spin is not maximal, the IMBH can only accrete at most half of its mass. Our estimates can constrain the relative contribution of accretion and mergers to the growth of IMBHs in dense stellar environments.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Transients in Time Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide fields of view, high sensitivity, and broad energy coverage of current X-ray and gamma-ray satellites, coupled with the high cadence observational strategy of some of them (recently Swift and Fermi) have been ideal for carrying out unprecedented studies of the variability properties of different classes of Galactic and extra-Galactic high-energy sources. These classes of objects range from nearby flaring stars to the most distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper we focus on some of the most energetic events, i.e. those powered by accretion (black hole binaries, ultra-luminous X-rays and Active Galactic Nuclei) until those leading to the first detections of GravitationalWaves (GWs), i.e. the Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), passing through the controversial Inter-Mediate Mass Black-Holes (IMBHs). We show the importance of X-ray and gamma-ray emission for the determination of the properties (mass, spin, inclination, height of the corona) of the compact objects residing in systems powered by accretion and the role of the LIGO and VIRGO interferometers in the case of the (compact objects) binary mergers. Gravitational waves allow the determination of the properties of the non-light-emitting compact objects (black-holes; BHs) in binary mergers (BH-BH) that otherwise would be nearly impossible. We show that for the case of neutron star (NS) mergers (NS-BH or NS-NS) electro-magnetic (EM) emission is still possible, and very powerful, being the responsible for the X-ray and gamma-ray emission of many GRBs (kilonovae). Very recently these transients have been discovered to show X-ray and gamma-ray variability patterns that could lead to very important insights into the properties of the binary mergers that originated them, opening a new view for their study.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and photometric study of the new eclipsing polar Gaia23cer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the optical study of the new eclipsing polar Gaia23cer. We analyzed the brightness variability of the polar in high ($\langle r \rangle \approx 16.5\mathrm{\,mag}$) and low ($\langle r \rangle \approx 19.2\mathrm{\,mag}$) states. The system has an orbital period $P_{orb} = 102.0665 \pm 0.0015$ min and exhibits deep eclipses with a duration $\Delta t_{ecl} = 401.30 \pm 0.81$ s. The spectra have a red cyclotron continuum with the Zeeman H$\alpha$ absorption triplet forming in a magnetic field with a strength of $15.2 \pm 1.1$ MG. The source of emission lines has a high radial velocity semiamplitude ($K\approx 450$km/s) and its eclipse lags behind the eclipse of the white dwarf. The mass $M_1=0.79 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$ and temperature $T=11350 \pm 650 K$ of the white dwarf have been found by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The eclipse duration corresponds to a donor mass $M_2 = 0.10-0.13M_{\odot}$ and an orbital inclination $i=84.3-87.0^{\circ}$. The donor temperature was estimated to be $T\approx 2900K$ by modelling the elliptical variability and eclipse depth.</description>

      <title>Capability of Searching for Kilonova Associated with a Short Gamma-ray Burst by SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of the importance of studying the cosmic generation of heavy elements through the r-process, the detection of kilonova resulted from a merger of neutron star binaries is still a challenge task. In this paper, we show that the Visible Telescope (VT) onboard the on-going SVOM space mission is powerful for identifying kilonova candidates associated with short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) up to a distance of 600Mpc. A significant color variation, turn blue and then turn red, is revealed by calculating the light curves in both red and blue channels of VT by a linear combination of an afterglow and an associated kilonova. The maximum color variation is as high as $\sim0.5-1$ mag, which is far larger than the small photometry error of $\sim0.2$ mag of VT for a point source with a brightness of 23 mag. Up to a distance of 600Mpc, $\sim1-2$ kilonova candidates per year are predicted to be identified by VT.</description>

      <title>Pulsar wind nebulae meeting the circumstellar medium of their progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significative fraction of high mass stars sail away through the interstellar medium of the galaxies. Once they evolved and died via a core collapse supernova, a magnetized, rotating neutron star (a pulsar) is usually their leftover. The immediate surroundings of the pulsar is the pulsar wind, which forms a nebula whose morphology is shaped by the supernova ejecta, channeled into the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star in the pre supernova time. Consequently, irregular pulsar wind nebulae display a large variety of radio appearances, screened by their interacting supernova blast wave or harboring asymmetric up down emission. Here, we present a series of 2.5 dimensional non relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations exploring the evolution of the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) generated by a red supergiant and a Wolf Rayet massive supernova progenitors, moving with Mach number M eq. to 1 and M eq. to 2 into the warm phase of the galactic plane. In such a simplified approach, the progenitors direction of motion, the local ambient medium magnetic field, the progenitor and pulsar axis of rotation, are all aligned, which restrict our study to peculiar pulsar wind nebula of high equatorial energy flux. We found that the reverberation of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae, when sufficiently embedded into its dead stellar surroundings and interacting with the supernova ejecta, is asymmetric and differs greatly as a function of the past circumstellar evolution of its progenitor, which reflects into their projected radio synchrotron emission. This mechanism is particularly at work in the context of remnants involving slowly moving or very massive stars. We find that the mixing of material in plerionic core collapse supernova remnants is strongly affected by the asymmetric reverberation in their pulsar wind nebulae.</description>

      <title>Strange Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: Confronting Observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetized jets, originating near black holes, are observed to exhibit sub-structured flows. In this study, we present synthetic synchrotron emission signatures for different lines of sight and frequencies, derived from three-dimensional relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of pc-scale AGN jets. These simulations apply different injection nozzles, injecting steady, variable, and precessing jets. Extending our previous study, here, we have developed a bridge to connect jet dynamics and particle acceleration within relativistic shocks with non-thermal radiation dominant in jets. The emission is derived from Lagrangian particles - injected into the jet and following the fluid - accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration and subsequently cooled by emitting energy via synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes. Overall, the different shocks structures lead to the formation of numerous localized emission patterns - interpreted as jet knots. These knot patterns can fade or flare, also as a consequence of merging or Doppler boosting, leading to jet variability. We find knots with high-enough pattern speed supposed to be visible as superluminal motion &lt;~5c. Synchrotron spectra of all jets reveal double-humped structures, reflecting multiple electron populations characterized by the nature of underlying shock and their age. The precessing jet is the most powerful emitter, featuring a spectrum flatter than the steady and the variable jet. The emission, although essentially governed by the acceleration through shocks, depends on the cooling history of the particle as well. Overall, the continuous re-acceleration of electrons through shocks along the jet we found, is an essential prerequisite for observing extended jet emission over large time-scales and length-scales.</description>

      <title>Simulating radio emission from particle cascades with CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CORSIKA 8 is a new framework for simulations of particle cascades in air and dense media implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes, in particular CORSIKA 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable particle shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the electric field calculation and its propagation through complex media to each observer location in an autonomous and flexible way. It already allows for the simultaneous simulation of the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the "Endpoint formalism" as previously implemented in CoREAS and the "ZHS" algorithm as ported from ZHAireS. The design acts as the baseline interface for current and future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in standard and complex scenarios, such as cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice. In this work, we present the design and implementation of the radio module in CORSIKA 8, along with validation studies and a direct comparison of the radio emission from air showers simulated with CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7 and ZHAireS. We also present the impact of simulation details such as the step size of simulated particle tracks on radio-emission simulations and perform a direct comparison of the "Endpoints" and "ZHS" formalisms for the same underlying air showers. Finally, we present an in-depth comparison of CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7 for optimum simulation settings and discuss the relevance of observed differences in light of reconstruction efforts for the energy and mass of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Polarized radiation coming from the spreading layer of the weakly magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations show that the X-ray emission of the accreting weakly magnetized neutron stars is polarized. Here, we develop a theoretical model, where we assume the emission of the accreting neutron star coming from the spreading layer, the extension of the boundary between the disk and the neutron star surface onto the surface. We then calculate the Stokes parameters of the emission accounting for relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in the Schwarzschild metric. We show that regardless of the geometry, for the spreading layer, we cannot expect the polarization degree to be higher than 1.5%. Our results have implications with regard to the understanding of the X-ray polarization from weakly magnetized neutron stars observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and the future enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding pulsar observations with the CVN incorporating the FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for pulsar research is becoming increasingly prominent and receiving more and more attention. In this paper, we present pathfinding pulsar observation results with the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) incorporating the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). On MJD 60045 (April 11th, 2023), PSRs B0919+06 and B1133+16 were observed with the phase-referencing mode in the L-band using four radio telescopes (FAST, TianMa, Haoping and Nanshan) and correlated with the pulsar binning mode of the distributed FX-style software correlator in Shanghai. After further data processing with the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS), we detected these two pulsars and fitted their current positions with accuracy at the milliarcsecond level. By comparison, our results show significantly better agreement with predicted values based on historical VLBI observations than that with previous timing observations, as pulsar astrometry with the VLBI provides a more direct and model-independent method for accurately obtaining related parameters.</description>

      <title>An X-ray flaring event and a variable soft X-ray excess in the Seyfert LCRS B040659.9-385922 as detected with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme continuum variability in AGNs can indicate extreme changes in accretion flows onto supermassive black holes. We explore the multiwavelength nature of a continuum flare in the Seyfert LCRS B040659.9$-$385922. The all-sky X-ray surveys conducted by the eROSITA showed that its X-ray flux increased by a factor of roughly five over six months, and concurrent optical photometric monitoring with the ATLAS showed a simultaneous increase. We triggered a multiwavelength follow-up monitoring program (XMM, NICER; optical spectroscopy) to study the evolution of the accretion disk, broad-line region, and X-ray corona. During the campaign, X-ray and optical continuum flux subsided over roughly six months. We detected a soft X-ray excess near the flare peak and after it subsided, both exhibiting a power-law (nonthermal) behavior. We modeled the broadband optical/UV/X-ray spectral energy distribution at both the flare peak and post-flare times with the AGNSED model, incorporating thermal disk emission into the optical/UV and warm thermal Comptonization in the soft X-rays. Additionally, we find that the broad Heii $\lambda$4686 emission line fades significantly as the optical/UV/X-ray continuum fades, which could indicate a substantial flare of disk emission above 54 eV. We also observed a redshifted broad component in the H${\beta}$ emission line that is present during the high flux state of the source and disappears in subsequent observations. We witnessed a likely sudden strong increase in local accretion rate, which manifested itself via an increase in accretion disk emission and thermal Comptonization emission in the soft X-rays, followed by a decrease in accretion and Comptonized luminosity. The physical processes leading to such substantial variations are still an open question, and future continuous monitoring along with multi-wavelength studies will shed some light on it.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field geometry of the gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63 revealed via X-ray polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some X-ray binaries containing an energetic pulsar in orbit around a normal star accelerate particles to high energies in the shock cone formed where the pulsar and stellar winds collide. The magnetic field geometry in the acceleration region in such binaries is unknown. We performed the first measurement of the polarization of the X-ray synchrotron emission from a gamma-ray emitting binary system. We observed PSR B1259-63 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) during an X-ray bright phase following the periastron passage in June 2024. X-ray polarization is detected with a polarization degree of $8.3\% \pm 1.5\%$ at a significance of $5.3 \sigma$. The X-ray polarization angle is aligned with the axis of the shock cone at the time of the observation. This indicates that the predominant component of the magnetic field in the acceleration region is oriented perpendicular to the shock cone axis.</description>

      <title>On the explosion engine of supernovae driven by a hadron-quark phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hadron-quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of proto-compact stars (PCSs), with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion ($\sim\!0.04\%\!-\!1\%$) of the released binding energy $\Delta E_B$ transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp,diag}$, which saturates at $\sim\!6\times10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$ near the black hole formation. We draw the phase diagrams for the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron-quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can be used to guide further investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron-quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.</description>

      <title>Actinide signatures in low electron fraction kilonova ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are known to produce heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. Actinides are expected to be created solely by the r-process in the most neutron rich environments. Confirming if NS mergers provide the requisite conditions for actinide creation is therefore central to determining their origin in the Universe. Actinide signatures in kilonova (KN) spectra may yield an answer, provided adequate models are available in order to interpret observational data. In this study, we investigate actinide signatures in neutron rich merger ejecta. We use three ejecta models with different compositions and radioactive power, generated by nucleosynthesis calculations using the same initial electron fraction ($Y_e = 0.15$) but with different nuclear physics inputs and thermodynamic expansion history. These are evolved from 10 - 100 days after merger using the SUMO non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code. We highlight how uncertainties in nuclear properties, as well as choices in thermodynamic trajectory, may yield entirely different outputs for equal values of $Y_e$. We consider an actinide-free model and two actinide-rich models, and find that the emergent spectra and lightcurve evolution are significantly different depending on the amount of actinides present, and the overall decay properties of the models. We also present potential key actinide spectral signatures, of which doubly ionized $_{89}Ac$ and $_{90}Th$ may be particularly interesting as potential spectral indicators of actinide presence in KN ejecta.</description>

      <title>Discover high-$z$ BL Lacs by {\it Swift} and SARA observations with the dropout technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic redshift measurement of BL Lac, a class of blazar, is challenging because its spectrum has no or weak emission lines ($\leqslant5\AA$). We estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertainty type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample: the {\it Swift} space telescope observes sources in $uvw2,\ uvm2,\ uvw1,\ u,\ b,\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\ r,' \ i',\ z'$ filters. The photometric data are obtained using the {\it photozpy} package. We fit the photometric data by the LePhare package and report four new high-$z$ ($z&gt;1.3$) BL Lacs at $2.03^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, $1.84^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$, $2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$, $2.93^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$ as well as upper limits for 50 sources. The work increased the number of high-$z$ BL Lacs found by this method up to 23. The high-$z$ sources are discussed in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, blazar sequence, Fermi blazar divide, and masquerading BL Lacs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transients and their host galaxies with Scarlet2: A framework to forward model multi-epoch imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many science cases for wide-field time-domain surveys rely on accurate identification and characterization of the galaxies hosting transient and variable objects. In the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory the number of known transient and variable sources will grow by orders of magnitude, and many of these sources will be blended with their host galaxies and neighboring galaxies. A diverse range of applications - including the classification of nuclear and non-nuclear sources, identification of potential host galaxies, extraction of host galaxy SEDs without requiring a transient-free reference image, and combined analysis of photometry from multiple surveys - will benefit from a flexible framework to model time-domain imaging of transients. We describe a time-domain extension of the Scarlet2 scene modeling code for multi-epoch, multi-band, and multi-resolution imaging data to extract simultaneous transient and host galaxy models. Scarlet2 leverages the benefits of data-driven priors on galaxy morphology, is fully GPU compatible, and can jointly model multi-resolution data from ground and space-based surveys. We demonstrate the method on simulated LSST-like supernova imaging, low-resolution Zwicky Transient Facility imaging of tidal disruption events, and Hyper Suprime Cam imaging of variable AGN out to z = 4 in the COSMOS fields. We show that Scarlet2 models provide accurate transient and host galaxy models as well as accurate measurement of host-transient spatial offsets, and demonstrate future applications to the search for 'wandering' massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Radio Signatures of Star-Planet Interactions, Exoplanets, and Space Weather</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio detections of stellar systems provide a window onto stellar magnetic activity and the space weather conditions of extrasolar planets, information that is difficult to attain at other wavelengths. There have been recent advances observing auroral emissions from radio-bright low-mass stars and exoplanets largely due to the maturation of low-frequency radio instruments and the plethora of wide-field radio surveys. To guide us in placing these recent results in context, we introduce the foremost local analogues for the field: Solar bursts and the aurorae found on Jupiter. We detail how radio bursts associated with stellar flares are foundational to the study of stellar coronae, and time-resolved radio dynamic spectra offers one of the best prospects of detecting and characterising coronal mass ejections from other stars. We highlight the prospects of directly detecting coherent radio emission from exoplanetary magnetospheres, and early tentative results. We bridge this discussion to the field of brown dwarf radio emission, in which their larger and stronger magnetospheres are amenable to detailed study with current instruments. Bright, coherent radio emission is also predicted from magnetic interactions between stars and close-in planets. We discuss the underlying physics of these interactions and implications of recent provisional detections for exoplanet characterisation. We conclude with an overview of outstanding questions in theory of stellar, star-planet interaction, and exoplanet radio emission, and the prospects of future facilities in answering them.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension: Relativistic Dark Matter Production from Long-lived Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tension between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and those stemming from Cosmic Microwave Background probes has triggered a multitude of studies. The connection between cosmology and particle physics has shown to be a valuable approach to addressing the Hubble tension. In particular, increasing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe helps alleviate the problem. In this work, we write down effective field theory describing relativistic dark matter production in association with neutrinos leading to a larger $H_0$. We derive limits on the effective energy scale that governs this relativistic production of dark matter as a function of the dark matter mass for fermion, vector, and scalar dark matter fields. In particular, scalar dark matter particles are more effective in increasing the effective number of relativistic species. Also, if they have weak scale masses, then the relativistic production of dark matter should be governed by Planck scale effective operators in order to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>CMB and energy conservation limits on nanohertz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) in the nanohertz band, announced by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world, has been posited to be sourced by either a population of supermassive black holes binaries or perturbations of spacetime near the inflationary era, generated by a zoo of various new physical phenomena. Gravitational waves (GWs) from these latter models would be explained by extensions to the standard model of cosmology and possibly to the standard model of particle physics. While PTA datasets can be used to characterize the parameter spaces of these models, energy conservation and limits from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used $\textit{a priori}$ to bound those parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that taking a simple rule for energy conservation and using CMB bounds on the radiation energy density can set stringent limits on the parameters for these models.</description>

      <title>Reverberation Mapping of Lamp-post and Wind Structures in Accretion Thin Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I AGNs with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope ($T\propto R^{-0.66}$, compared to $R^{-3/4}$ traditionally) and a color correction factor ($f_{\rm col} \approx 1.6$), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach offers a rapid and effective method for reverberation mapping.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of moderately dense cold quark matter is investigated within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that in the regime of weak and intermediate diquark coupling strength, the color-spin-locked (CSL) phase could be most favored, and the density range where CSL phase survives is determined by two quark chemical potentials: one corresponding to the chiral phase transition and the other for the emergence of the gapless color-flavor-locked (CFL) condensate. Based on the theoretical hypothesis that the quark star could be the hideout for CSL quark matter, an interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process of a proper quark star. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the star with a critical strength, while in some special cases, a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. An analysis on energetics and time scale is performed to investigate if this expulsion of magnetic flux could power or induce high-energy electromagnetic emissions.</description>

      <title>Gaia BH1 and BH2 -- Evolutionary Models with Overshooting of the Black Hole Progenitors within the Present-Day Binary Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Fermi systems at low densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and flavour mixing by incorporating the gravitational effects through the Dirac equation in curved spacetime inside a spherically symmetric star. We show that the flavour transition probabilities of the neutrinos depend on the interior spacetime metric as they propagate out of the star. As a consequence, we show that one could distinguish between different possible equation of states of nuclear matter even for an isolated neutron star if one could determine the flavour composition of emitted neutrinos near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>A candidate coherent radio flash following a neutron star merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present rapid follow-up observations of the short GRB 201006A, consistent with being a compact binary merger, using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We have detected a candidate 5.6$\sigma$, short, coherent radio flash at 144 MHz at 76.6 mins post-GRB with a 3$\sigma$ duration of 38 seconds. This radio flash is 27 arcsec offset from the GRB location, which has a probability of occurring by chance of $\sim$0.05% (3.8$\sigma$) when accounting for measurement uncertainties. Despite the offset, we show that the probability of finding an unrelated transient within 40 arcsec of the GRB location is $&lt;10^{-6}$ and conclude that this is a candidate radio counterpart to GRB 201006A. We performed image plane dedispersion and the radio flash is tentatively (2.4$\sigma$) shown to be highly dispersed, allowing a distance estimate, corresponding to a redshift of $0.58\pm0.06$. The corresponding luminosity of the event at this distance is $6.7^{+6.6}_{-4.4} \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. If associated with GRB 201006A, this emission would indicate prolonged activity from the central engine that is consistent with being a newborn, supramassive, likely highly magnetised, millisecond spin neutron star (a magnetar).</description>

      <title>Significant impact of Galactic dark matter particles on annihilation signals from Sagittarius analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the gamma-ray signal from dark matter (DM) annihilation from analogues of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Auriga cosmological simulations. For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over three orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the corresponding emission does not significantly change. For the Sommerfeld model, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for s, p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr. We find that, given the background emission estimated from this region, the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.</description>

      <title>High energy neutrino production in gamma-ray bursts: dependence of the neutrino signal on the jet composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy nuclei can be synthetized or entrained in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with implications on the high-energy neutrino emission. By means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm, we model nuclear cascades and investigate their impact on the neutrino production considering kinetic dominated jets (in the internal shock model, including a dissipative photosphere) as well as Poynting flux dominated jets (for a jet model invoking internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence, ICMART). We find that the ICMART model allows for efficient nuclear cascades leading to an overall larger neutrino fluence than in the other two jet models. The survival of nuclei and inefficient nuclear cascades lead to an overall reduction of the neutrino fluence up to one order of magnitude. However, if nuclei are disintegrated, the neutrino fluence may be comparable to the one emitted from a jet loaded with protons. Exploring the parameter space of jet properties, we conclude that the composition and the bulk Lorentz factor have significant impact on the efficiency of nuclear cascades as well as the spectral shape of the expected neutrino fluence. On the other hand, the neutrino spectral distribution is less sensitive to the power-law index of the accelerated population of protons or heavier nuclei. For what concerns the diffuse emission of neutrinos from GRBs, we find that the uncertainty due to the jet composition can be at most comparable to the one related to the GRB cosmological rate.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short gamma-ray bursts (llsGRBs), as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole. Our work probes the nature of neutron star mergers and highlights the importance of the shape of the ejecta profile in modeling early electromagnetic counterparts to these mergers.</description>

      <title>Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16891v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia is expected to resolve 300--1,000 (700--1,500) detached BH--LC binaries with SNR&gt;10 (1) depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. Similarly, the number of resolved BH--LC binaries with TESS are ~50--200 (140--350). We find that 136^{+15}_{-15} BH--LC binaries would be common between Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~60--70 (50--200) BH--LC binaries identifiable using photometry with SNR &gt;10 may also be resolved using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes~(PBHs) formed in the early Universe are well-motivated dark matter~(DM) candidates over a wide range of masses. These PBHs could emit detectable signals in the form of photons, electrons, and neutrinos through Hawking radiation. We consider the null observations of astrophysical $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ flux from several neutrino detectors and set new constraints on the PBHs as the dominant DM component to be above $6.4\times10^{15}\,{\rm g}$. We also estimate the expected constraints with JUNO for the prospects in the near future. Lastly, we note that the diffuse supernova neutrino background~(DSNB) is an unavoidable isotropic background. We thus estimate the sensitivity floor for PBH parameter space due to the DSNB and show that it is challenging for neutrino detectors to identify PBHs as they constitute 100\% of the DM above a mass of 9$\times10^{15}$g.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between dark matter (DM) and the standard model sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large-scale ordered magnetic fields generated in mergers of helium white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$.
  We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analysed an equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and an unequal-mass merger with white dwarfs of $0.25\,M_\odot$ and $0.35\,M_\odot$. We simulated the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations.
  We found efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at a similar strength for both simulations.
  We then identified a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field via a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability.
  Finally, we speculate that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will initially start in a shell around a cold core, rather than in the centre. This forms a convection zone that coincides with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, and likely destroys the strong, ordered field. Ohmic resistivity might then quickly erase the remaining small-scale field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.</description>
