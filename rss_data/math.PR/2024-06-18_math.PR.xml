      <title>Markovian Lifts of Stochastic Volterra Equations in Sobolev Spaces: Solution theory, an Ito Formula and Invariant Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Markovian lifts of stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) with completely monotone kernels and general coefficients within a class of weighted Sobolev spaces. Our primary focus is developing a comprehensive solution theory for a class of non-local stochastic evolution equations (SEEs) encompassing these Markovian lifts. This enables us to provide conditions for the existence of invariant measures for the lifted processes and the corresponding SVE. Another key contribution is an Ito-type formula for the stochastic Volterra equations under consideration.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem with explicit Lyapunov exponent and variance for products of $2\times2$ random non-invertible matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of products of random matrices and Lyapunov exponents have been widely studied and applied in the fields of biology, dynamical systems, economics, engineering and statistical physics. We consider the product of an i.i.d. sequence of $2\times 2$ random non-invertible matrices with real entries. Given some mild moment assumptions we prove an explicit formula for the Lyapunov exponent and prove a central limit theorem with an explicit formula for the variance in terms of the entries of the matrices. We also give examples where exact values for the Lyapunov exponent and variance are computed. An important example where non-invertible matrices are essential is the random Hill's equation, which has numerous physical applications, including the astrophysical orbit problem.</description>

      <title>The decomposition of stretched Brownian motion into Bass martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work J. Backhoff-Veraguas, M. Beiglb\"ock and the present authors showed that the notions of stretched Brownian motion and Bass martingale between two probability measures on Euclidean space coincide if and only if these two measures satisfy an irreducibility condition.
  Now we consider the general case, i.e. a pair of measures which are not necessarily irreducible. We show that there is a paving of Euclidean space into relatively open convex sets such that the stretched Brownian motion decomposes into a (possibly uncountable) family of Bass martingales on these sets. This paving coincides with the irreducible convex paving studied in previous work of H. De March and N. Touzi.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and large deviations of fractional McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the large deviation principle of the fractional McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equation defined on R^n with polynomial drift of any degree. We first prove the well-posedness of the underlying equation under a dissipative condition, and then show the strong convergence of solutions of the corresponding controlled equation with respect to the weak topology of controls, by employing the idea of uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions in order to circumvent the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. We finally establish the large deviation principle of the fractional McKean-Vlasov equation by the weak convergence method without assuming the time Holder continuity of the non-autonomous diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</description>

      <title>Iterated Schr\"odinger bridge approximation to Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel discretization scheme for Wasserstein gradient flows that involves successively computing Schr\"{o}dinger bridges with the same marginals. This is different from both the forward/geodesic approximation and the backward/Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) approximations. The proposed scheme has two advantages: one, it avoids the use of the score function, and, two, it is amenable to particle-based approximations using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our proof hinges upon showing that relative entropy between the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge with the same marginals at temperature $\epsilon$ and the joint distribution of a stationary Langevin diffusion at times zero and $\epsilon$ is of the order $o(\epsilon^2)$ with an explicit dependence given by Fisher information. Owing to this inequality, we can show, using a triangular approximation argument, that the interpolated iterated application of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge approximation converge to the Wasserstein gradient flow, for a class of gradient flows, including the heat flow. The results also provide a probabilistic and rigorous framework for the convergence of the self-attention mechanisms in transformer networks to the solutions of heat flows, first observed in the inspiring work SABP22 in machine learning research.</description>

      <title>Small ball probabilities for the passage time in planar first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar first-passage percolation with independent weights whose common distribution is supported on $(0,\infty)$ and is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. We prove that the passage time from $x$ to $y$ denoted by $T(x,y)$ satisfies $$\max _{a\ge 0} \mathbb P \big( T(x,y)\in [a,a+1] \big) \le \frac{C}{\sqrt{\log \|x-y\|}},$$ answering a question posed by of Ahlberg and de la Riva. This estimate recovers earlier results on the fluctuations of the passage time by Newman and Piza, Pemantle and Peres, and Chatterjee.</description>

      <title>Tightness for the Cover Time of Wired Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous time simple random walk on a subset of the square lattice with wired boundary conditions: the walk transitions at unit edge rate on the graph obtained from the lattice closure of the subset by contracting the boundary into one vertex. We study the cover time of such walk, namely the time it takes for the walk to visit all vertices in the graph. Taking a sequence of subsets obtained as scaled lattice versions of a nice planar domain, we show that the square root of the cover time normalized by the size of the subset, is tight around $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \log N - \frac{1}{4 \sqrt{\pi}} \log \log N$, where $N$ is the scale parameter. This proves an analog, for the wired case, of a conjecture by Bramson and Zeitouni from 2009. The proof is based on comparison with the extremal landscape of the discrete Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Vague and basic convergence of signed measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between different kinds of convergence of finite signed measures and discuss their metrizability. In particular, we study the concept of basic convergence recently introduced by Khartov [arXiv:2204.13667] and introduce the related concept of almost basic convergence. We discover that a sequence of finite signed measures converges vaguely if and only if it is locally uniformly bounded in variation and the corresponding sequence of distribution functions either converges in Lebesgue measure up to constants, converges basically, or converges almost basically.</description>

      <title>Heat flow in a periodically forced, unpinned thermostatted chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one-dimensional harmonic chain of interacting atoms with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open: at the left boundary it is attached to a heat bath at temperature $T_-$, while at the right endpoint it is subject to an action of a force which reads as $\bar F + \frac 1{\sqrt n} \widetilde{\mathcal F} (n^2 t)$, where $\bar F \ge0$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal F}(t)$ is a periodic function. Here $n$ is the size of the microscopic system. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities - the volume stretch and the energy - converge, as $n\to+\infty$, to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations with a Dirichlet type and Neumann boundary conditions on the left and the right endpoints, respectively.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration Inequalities and Free Probability II. Two-sided Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new family of nonasymptotic matrix concentration inequalities that sharply capture the spectral properties of very general Gaussian (as well as non-Gaussian) random matrices in terms of an associated noncommutative model. These methods achieved matching upper and lower bounds for smooth spectral statistics, but only provided upper bounds for the spectral edges. Here we obtain matching lower bounds for the spectral edges, completing the theory initiated in the first paper. The resulting two-sided bounds enable the study of applications that require an exact determination of the spectral edges to leading order, which is fundamentally beyond the reach of classical matrix concentration inequalities. To illustrate their utility, we undertake a detailed study of phase transition phenomena for spectral outliers of nonhomogeneous random matrices.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of colored noise-driven interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient sensitivity analysis method for a wide class of colored noise-driven interacting particle systems (IPS). Our method is based on unperturbed simulations and significantly extends the Malliavin weight sampling method proposed by Szamel (EPL, 117 (2017) 50010) for evaluating sensitivities such as linear response functions of IPS driven by simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show that the sensitivity index depends not only on two effective parameters that characterize the variance and correlation time of the noise, but also on the noise spectrum. In the case of a single particle in a harmonic potential, we obtain exact analytical formulas for two types of linear response functions. By applying our method to a system of many particles interacting via a repulsive screened Coulomb potential, we compute the mobility and effective temperature of the system. Our results show that the system dynamics depend, in a nontrivial way, on the noise spectrum.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for extrema of Airy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish limit theorems for the maxima and minima of Airy$_1$ and Airy$_2$ processes (denoted by $\mathcal{A}_1(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{A}_2(\cdot)$ respectively) over growing intervals. In particular, we identify the finite non-zero constants that are the almost sure limits of $(\log t)^{-2/3}\max_{0\le s \le t} \mathcal{A}_{i}(s)$ and $(\log t)^{-1/3}\min_{0\le s \le t} \mathcal{A}_{i}(s)$ for $i=1,2$. This complements and extends the results of (Pu, 2023), where the question for the maxima was considered and the order of growth was identified for both $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$ and the constant was identified for $\mathcal{A}_1$. Our approach is different from that of (Pu, 2023); instead of complicated formulae for multi-point distributions, we rely on the well-known convergence of passage time profiles in planar exponential last passage percolation started from different initial conditions to $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$, together with the recently developed sharp one-point estimates in (Baslingker et al., 2024) for the point-to-point and point-to-line passage times in exponential LPP and a combination of old and new results on the geometry of the LPP landscape.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Number of Topics Intrinsically: Is It Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of topics might be the most important parameter of a topic model. The topic modelling community has developed a set of various procedures to estimate the number of topics in a dataset, but there has not yet been a sufficiently complete comparison of existing practices. This study attempts to partially fill this gap by investigating the performance of various methods applied to several topic models on a number of publicly available corpora. Further analysis demonstrates that intrinsic methods are far from being reliable and accurate tools. The number of topics is shown to be a method- and a model-dependent quantity, as opposed to being an absolute property of a particular corpus. We conclude that other methods for dealing with this problem should be developed and suggest some promising directions for further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time strong approximations of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients.Under certain non-globally Lipschitz conditions, a long-time version of fundamental strong convergence theorem is established for general one-step time discretization schemes. With the aid of the fundamental strong convergence theorem, we prove the expected strong convergence rate over infinite time for two types of schemes such as the backward Euler method and the projected Euler method in non-globally Lipschitz settings. Numerical examples are finally reported to confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Walks and Quantum Oscillator in an Infinite-Dimensional Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum random walks in an infinite-dimensional phase space constructed using Weyl representation of the coordinate and momentum operators in the space of functions on a Hilbert space which are square integrable with respect to a shift-invariant measure. We study unitary groups of shift operators in the phase space and averaging of such shifts by Gaussian vectors, which form semigroups of self-adjoint contractions: we find conditions for their strong continuity and establish properties of their generators. Significant differences in their properties allow us to show the absence of the Fourier transform as a unitary transformation that implements the unitary equivalence of these compressive semigroups. Next, we prove the Taylor formula for a certain special subset of smooth functions for shifting to a non-finite vector. It allows us to prove convergence of quantum random walks in the coordinate representation to the evolution of a diffusion process, as well as convergence of quantum random walks in both coordinate and momentum representations to the evolution semigroup of a quantum oscillator in an infinite-dimensional phase space. We find the special essential common domain of generators of semigroups arising in averaging of random shift operators both in position and momentum representations. The invariance of this common domain with respect to both semigroups allows to establish properties of a convex combination of both generators. That convex combination are Hamiltonians of infinite-dimentional quantum oscillators. Thus, we obtain that a Weyl representation of a random walk in an infinite dimensional phase space describes the semigroup of self-adjoint contractions whose generator is the Hamiltonian of an infinite dimensional harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modelling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My methods use ideas from statistical physics and present an alternative to some recently proposed measure-theoretic frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recognise that an entropy inequality akin to the main intermediate goal of recent works (Gowers, Green, Manners, Tao [3],[2]) regarding a conjecture of Marton provides a black box from which we can also through a short deduction recover another description: if a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ is such that the distribution of the sums $a+b$ with $(a,b) \in A \times A$ is only slightly more spread out than the uniform distribution on $A$, then $A$ has small symmetric difference with some finite coset of $G$. The resulting bounds are necessarily sharp up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Deep neural networks with ReLU, leaky ReLU, and softplus activation provably overcome the curse of dimensionality for space-time solutions of semilinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.</description>

      <title>Local wealth condensation for yard-sale models with wealth-dependent biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Chakraborti's yard-sale model of an economy, identical agents engage in pairwise trades, resulting in wealth exchanges that conserve each agent's expected wealth. Doob's martingale convergence theorem immediately implies almost sure wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which a single agent owns the entire economy. If some pairs of agents are not allowed to trade with each other, the martingale convergence theorem still implies local wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which some agents are wealthy, while all their trading partners are impoverished. In this note, we propose a new, more elementary proof of this result. Unlike the proof based on the martingale convergence theorem, our argument applies to models with a wealth-acquired advantage, and even to certain models with a poverty-acquired advantage.</description>

Abstract: We study the systole of a model of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds introduced by Petri and Raimbault, answering a question posed in that same article. These are compact manifolds with boundary constructed by randomly gluing truncated tetrahedra along their faces. We prove that the limit, as the volume tends to infinity, of the expected value of their systole exists and we give a closed formula of it. Moreover, we compute a numerical approximation of this value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.11820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we are interested in the long-term behaviour of branching processes with pairwise interactions (BPI-processes). A process in this class behaves as a pure branching process with the difference that competition and cooperation events between pairs of individuals are also allowed. Here, we provide a series of integral tests that explain how competition and cooperation regulate the long-term behaviour of BPI-processes. In particular, such integral tests describe the events of explosion and extinction and provide conditions under which the process comes down from infinity. Moreover, we also determine whether the process admits, or not, a stationary distribution. Our arguments use a random time change representation in terms of a modified branching process with immigration and moment duality. The moment dual of BPI-processes turns out to be a family of diffusions taking values on $[0,1]$ which are interesting in their own right and that we introduce as generalised Wright-Fisher diffusions.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the disordered generalized Poland--Scheraga model for DNA denaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poland--Scheraga model, introduced in the 1970's, is a reference model to describe the denaturation transition of DNA. More recently, it has been generalized in order to allow for asymmetry in the strands lengths and in the formation of loops: the mathematical representation is based on a bivariate renewal process, that describes the pairs of bases that bond together. In this paper, we consider a disordered version of the model, in which the two strands interact via a potential $\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)+h$ when the $i$-th monomer of the first strand and the $j$-th monomer of the second strand meet. Here, $h\in\mathbb R$ is a homogeneous pinning parameter, $(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq 1}$ and $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$ are two sequences of i.i.d.~random variables attached to each DNA strand, $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ is an interaction function and $\beta&gt;0$ is the disorder intensity. Our main result finds some condition on the underlying bivariate renewal so that, if one takes $\beta,h\downarrow0$ at some appropriate (explicit) rate as the length of the strands go to infinity, the partition function of the model admits a non-trivial, i.e. disordered, scaling limit. This is known as an \textit{intermediate disorder} regime and is linked to the question of disorder relevance for the denaturation transition. Interestingly and surprisingly, the rate at which one has to take $\beta\downarrow0$ depends on the interaction function $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ and on the distribution of $(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq 1}$, $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$. On the other hand, the intermediate disorder limit of the partition function, when it exists, is universal: it is expressed as a chaos expansion of iterated integrals against a Gaussian process~$\mathcal{M}$, which arises as the scaling limit of the field $(e^{\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)})_{i,j\geq 0}$ and exhibits strong correlations on lines and columns.</description>

Abstract: We present the particle method for simulating the solution to the path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equation, in which both the drift and the diffusion coefficients depend on the whole trajectory of the process up to the current time t, as well as on the corresponding marginal distributions. Our paper establishes an explicit convergence rate for this numerical approach. We illustrate our findings with numerical simulations of a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with memory, and of an extension of the Jansen-Rit mean-field model for neural mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a cell population subject to a parasite infection. Cells divide at a constant rate and, at division, share the parasites they contain between their two daughter cells. The sharing may be asymmetrical, and its law may depend on the quantity of parasites in the mother. Cells die at a rate which may depend on the quantity of parasites they carry, and are also killed when this quantity explodes. We study the survival of the cell population as well as the mean quantity of parasites in the cells, and focus on the role of the parasites partitioning kernel at division.</description>

      <title>Directed Spatial Permutations on Asymmetric Tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of random spatial permutations on two-dimensional tori, and establish that the joint distribution of large cycles is asymptotically given by the Poisson--Dirichlet distribution with parameter one. The asymmetry of the tori we consider leads to a spatial bias in the permutations, and this allows for a simple argument to deduce the existence of mesoscopic cycles. The main challenge is to leverage this mesoscopic structure to establish the existence and distribution of macroscopic cycles. We achieve this by a dynamical resampling argument in conjunction with a method developed by Schramm for the study of random transpositions on the complete graph. Our dynamical analysis implements generic heuristics for the occurrence of the Poisson--Dirichlet distribution in random spatial permutations, and hence may be of more general interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the stationary measures for the free-energy increment process for the geometric last passage percolation (LPP) and log-gamma polymer model on a diagonal strip is given by a marginal of a two-layer Gibbs measure with a simple and explicit description. This result is shown subject to certain restrictions on the parameters controlling the weights on the boundary of the strip. However, from this description and an analytic continuation argument we are able to access the stationary measure for all boundary parameters. Taking an intermediate disorder limit of the log-gamma polymer stationary measure in a strip we readily recover (modulo convergence of the polymer to the open KPZ equation, Conjecture 4.2) the conjectural description from arXiv:2105.15178 of the open KPZ stationary measure for all choices of boundary parameters $u,v\in \mathbb{R}$ (thus going beyond the restriction $u+v\geq 0$ from arXiv:2103.12253).</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of gelation in the cluster coagulation model introduced by Norris [$\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$, 209(2):407-435 (2000)], where pairs of clusters of types $(x,y)$ taking values in a measure space $E$, merge to form a new particle of type $z\in E$ according to a transition kernel $K(x,y, \mathrm{d} z)$.This model possesses enough generality to accommodate inhomogenieties in the evolution of clusters, including variations in their shape or spatial distribution. We derive general, sufficient criteria for stochastic gelation and strong gelation in this model. As particular cases, we extend results related to the classical Marcus--Lushnikov coagulation process, showing that reasonable `homogenous' coagulation processes with exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ yield gelation; and also, coagulation processes with kernel $\bar{K}(m,n)~\geq~(m \wedge n) \log{(m \wedge n)}^{3 +\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$. Finally, we use coupling arguments with inhomogeneous random graphs to deduce sufficient criterion for strong gelation (the emergence of a particle of size $O(N)$).</description>

Abstract: We address a system of weakly interacting particles where the heterogenous connections among the particles are described by a graph sequence and the number of particles grows to infinity. Our results extend the existing law of large numbers and propagation of chaos results to the case where the interaction between one particle and its neighbors is expressed as a nonlinear function of the local empirical measure. In the limit of the number of particles which tends to infinity, if the graph sequence converges to a graphon, then we show that the limit system is described by an infinite collection of processes and can be seen as a process in a suitable $L^2$ space constructed via a Fubini extension. The proof is built on decoupling techniques and careful estimates of the Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>On the representation property for 1D general diffusion semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingle part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor, and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian random matrices, or directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks in the constant average degree regime $p =\frac{d}{n}$ where $d$ is fixed. Entries are assumed to have Weibull distributions with tail decaying at rate $e^{-t^{\alpha}}$ for $\alpha &gt;0$. While the law of large number results agree with the largest eigenvalue of sparse Hermitian matrices given in (Ganguly and Nam, '22) and (Ganguly, Hiesmayr and Nam, '22), large deviation results are surprisingly simpler, exhibiting a single transition at $\alpha =2$. The rate function for undirected networks with $0&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ involved a transition at $\alpha =1$ and a complicated variational formula due to the emergence of cliques with large edge-weights (Ganguly, Hiesmayr and Nam, '22). For directed networks, we introduce a clique reduction technique which reformulates the problem for undirected networks with maximum clique size $2$, and the rate function is greatly simplified. For $\alpha &gt;2$, both the law of large numbers and large deviation results are identical to the sparse Hermitian case. Our results easily generalize to rectangular i.i.d. ensembles.</description>

      <title>A new generalized prime random approximation procedure and some of its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new random approximation method that yields the existence of a discrete Beurling prime system $\mathcal{P}=\{p_{1}, p_{2}, \dotso\}$ which is very close in a certain precise sense to a given non-decreasing, right-continuous, nonnegative, and unbounded function $F$. This discretization procedure improves an earlier discrete random approximation method due to H. Diamond, H. Montgomery, and U. Vorhauer [Math. Ann. 334 (2006), 1-36], and refined by W.-B. Zhang [Math. Ann. 337 (2007), 671-704].
  We obtain several applications. Our new method is applied to a question posed by M. Balazard concerning Dirichlet series with a unique zero in their half plane of convergence, to construct examples of very well-behaved generalized number systems that solve a recent open question raised by T. Hilberdink and A. Neamah in [Int. J. Number Theory 16 05 (2020), 1005-1011], and to improve the main result from [Adv. Math. 370 (2020), Article 107240], where a Beurling prime system with regular primes but extremely irregular integers was constructed.</description>

      <title>Barycenters and a law of large numbers in Gromov hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate barycenters of probability measures on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, toward development of convex optimization in this class of metric spaces. We establish a contraction property (the Wasserstein distance between probability measures provides an upper bound of the distance between their barycenters), a deterministic approximation of barycenters of uniform distributions on finite points, and a kind of law of large numbers. These generalize the corresponding results on CAT(0)-spaces, up to additional terms depending on the hyperbolicity constant.</description>

      <title>Is this correct? Let's check!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Societal accumulation of knowledge is a complex process. The correctness of new units of knowledge depends not only on the correctness of new reasoning, but also on the correctness of old units that the new one builds on. The errors in such accumulation processes are often remedied by error correction and detection heuristics.
  Motivating examples include the scientific process based on scientific publications, and software development based on libraries of code.
  Natural processes that aim to keep errors under control, such as peer review in scientific publications, and testing and debugging in software development, would typically check existing pieces of knowledge -- both for the reasoning that generated them and the previous facts they rely on. In this work, we present a simple process that models such accumulation of knowledge and study the persistence (or lack thereof) of errors.
  We consider a simple probabilistic model for the generation of new units of knowledge based on the preferential attachment growth model, which additionally allows for errors. Furthermore, the process includes checks aimed at catching these errors. We investigate when effects of errors persist forever in the system (with positive probability) and when they get rooted out completely by the checking process.
  The two basic parameters associated with the checking process are the {\em probability} of conducting a check and the depth of the check. We show that errors are rooted out if checks are sufficiently frequent and sufficiently deep. In contrast, shallow or infrequent checks are insufficient to root out errors.</description>

      <title>Quantitative CLTs in Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06092v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of a fully connected neural network with random Gaussian weights and biases in which the hidden layer widths are proportional to a large constant $n$. Under mild assumptions on the non-linearity, we obtain quantitative bounds on normal approximations valid at large but finite $n$ and any fixed network depth. Our theorems show both for the finite-dimensional distributions and the entire process, that the distance between a random fully connected network (and its derivatives) to the corresponding infinite width Gaussian process scales like $n^{-\gamma}$ for $\gamma&gt;0$, with the exponent depending on the metric used to measure discrepancy. Our bounds are strictly stronger in terms of their dependence on network width than any previously available in the literature; in the one-dimensional case, we also prove that they are optimal, i.e., we establish matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>A Dimension-Independent Bound on the Wasserstein Contraction Rate of a Geodesic Random Walk on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the properties of a geodesic random walk on the Euclidean $d$-sphere. Specifically, we prove that the random walk's transition kernel is Wasserstein contractive with a contraction rate which can be bounded from above independently of the dimension $d$. Our result is of particular interest due to its implications regarding the potential for dimension-independent performance of both geodesic slice sampling on the sphere and Gibbsian polar slice sampling, which are Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for approximate sampling from essentially arbitrary distributions on their respective state spaces.</description>

      <title>Dimers on Riemann surfaces and compactified free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model on a bipartite graph embedded into a locally flat Riemann surface with conical singularities and satisfying certain geometric conditions in the spirit of the work of Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh, see arXiv:2001.11871. Following the approach developed by Dub\'edat in his work ["Dimers and families of Cauchy-Riemann operators I". In: J. Amer. Math. Soc. 28 (2015), pp. 1063-1167] we establish the convergence of dimer height fluctuations to the compactified free field in the small mesh size limit. This work is inspired by the series of works of Berestycki, Laslier, and Ray (see arXiv:1908.00832 and arXiv:2207.09875), where a similar problem is addressed, and the convergence to a conformally invariant limit is established in the Temperlian setup, but the identification of the limit as the compactified free field is missing. This identification is the main result of our paper.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of entropy and the MMSE conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy $H(\mu,t)$ of a probability measure $\mu$ along the heat flow and more precisely we seek for closed algebraic representations of its derivatives. Provided that $\mu$ admits moments of any order, it is indeed proved in [Guo et al., 2010] that $t\mapsto H(\mu,t)$ is smooth, and in [Ledoux, 2016] that its derivatives at zero can be expressed into multivariate polynomials evaluated in the moments (or cumulants) of $\mu$. In the seminal contribution \cite{Led}, these algebraic expressions are derived through $\Gamma$-calculus techniques which provide implicit recursive formulas for these polynomials. Our main contribution consists in a fine combinatorial analysis of these inductive relations and for the first time to derive closed formulas for the leading coefficients of these polynomials expressions.
  Building upon these explicit formulas we revisit the so-called "MMSE conjecture" from [Guo et al., 2010] which asserts that two distributions on the real line with the same entropy along the heat flow must coincide up to translation and symmetry. Our approach enables us to provide new conditions on the source distributions ensuring that the MMSE conjecture holds and to refine several criteria proved in [Ledoux, 2016]. As illustrating examples, our findings cover the cases of uniform and Rademacher distributions, for which previous results in the literature were inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Sampling and estimation on manifolds using the Langevin diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error bounds are derived for sampling and estimation using a discretization of an intrinsically defined Langevin diffusion with invariant measure $\text{d}\mu_\phi \propto e^{-\phi} \mathrm{dvol}_g $ on a compact Riemannian manifold. Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated in the sense $E[XY]=E[X]\cdot E[Y]$ and that the implication may be reversed in very specific cases only. This paper proves that under general assumptions the conditional uncorrelation of random variables, where the conditioning takes place over the suitable class of test sets, is equivalent to the independence. It is also shown that the mutual independence of $X_1,\dots,X_n$ is equivalent to the fact that any conditional correlation matrix equals to the identity matrix.</description>
