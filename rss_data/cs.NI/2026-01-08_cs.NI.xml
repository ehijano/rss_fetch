      <title>Prediction-Guided Control in Data Center Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Polyphony, a system to give network operators a new way to control and reduce the frequency of poor tail latency events in multi-class data center networks, on the time scale of minutes. Polyphony is designed to be complementary to other adaptive mechanisms like congestion control and traffic engineering, but targets different aspects of network operation that have previously been considered static. By contrast to Polyphony, prior model-free optimization methods work best when there are only a few relevant degrees of freedom and where workloads and measurements are stable, assumptions not present in modern data center networks.
  Polyphony develops novel methods for measuring, predicting, and controlling network quality of service metrics for a dynamically changing workload. First, we monitor and aggregate workloads on a network-wide basis; we use the result as input to an approximate counterfactual prediction engine that estimates the effect of potential network configuration changes on network quality of service; we apply the best candidate and repeat in a closed-loop manner aimed at rapidly and stably converging to a configuration that meets operator goals. Using CloudLab on a simple topology, we observe that Polyphony converges to tight SLOs within ten minutes, and re-stabilizes after large workload shifts within fifteen minutes, while the prior state of the art fails to adapt.</description>

      <title>Incentive Mechanism Design for Resource Management in Satellite Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource management is one of the challenges in satellite networks due to their high mobility, wide coverage, long propagation distances, and stringent constraints on energy, communication, and computation resources. Traditional resource allocation approaches rely only on hard and rigid system performance metrics. Meanwhile, incentive mechanisms, which are based on game theory and auction theory, investigate systems from the "economic" perspective in addition to the "system" perspective. Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of incentive mechanism design for resource management in satellite networks. The paper covers key issues in the satellite networks, such as communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy and security, and coordination. We conclude with future research directions including learning-based mechanism design for satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Monaas: Mobile Node as a Service for TSCH-based Industrial IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (&gt; 5.8 s).</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of a UAV-Mounted LEO Satellite Backhaul for Emergency Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable connectivity is critical for Public Protection and Disaster Relief operations, especially in rural or compromised environments where terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. In such scenarios, NTNs, and specifically UAVs, are promising candidates to provide on-demand and rapid connectivity on the ground, serving as aerial base stations. In this paper, we implement a setup in which a rotary-wing UAV, equipped with a Starlink Mini terminal, provides Internet connectivity to an emergency ground user in the absence of cellular coverage via LEO satellites. The UAV functions as a Wi-Fi access point, while backhauling the ground traffic through the Starlink constellation. We evaluate the system via both network simulations in ns-3 and real-world flight experiments in a rural environment, in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, and energy consumption under static and dynamic flight conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable uplink throughput of approximately 30 Mbps up to approximately 200 meters, and with minimal impact on the UAV battery lifetime. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying commercial LEO satellite terminals on UAVs as a practical solution for emergency connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future 6G networks are expected to utilize large antenna arrays and follow the user-centric architecture, where the user is being served by all base stations. This work evaluates such a system within an advanced system-level simulator, which utilizes an accurate 3D Ray-Tracing radio channel model. Results show that the novel user-centric network architecture can increase the cell-edge users throughput by a fold of 3.</description>

      <title>Cells on Autopilot: Adaptive Cell (Re)Selection via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04083v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on Flow-Based Network Traffic Classification Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern networks carry increasingly diverse and encrypted traffic types that demand classification techniques beyond traditional port-based and payload-based methods. This tutorial provides a practical, end-to-end guide to building machine-learning-based network traffic flow classification systems. We cover the workflow from flow metering and dataset creation, through ground-truth labeling and feature engineering, to leakage-resistant experimental design, model training and evaluation, explainability, and deployment considerations. The tutorial focuses on supervised flow-based classification that remains effective under encryption and provides actionable guidance on algorithm selection, performance metrics, and realistic partitioning strategies, with emphasis on common real-world measurement artifacts and methodological pitfalls. A companion set of five Jupyter notebooks on GitHub implements the data-to-model workflow on real traffic captures, enabling readers to reproduce key steps. The intended audience includes researchers and practitioners with foundational networking knowledge who aim to design and deploy robust traffic classification systems in operational environments.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Digital Twins for Next-Generation Networks: Forecasting Traffic and Resource Management in 5G/6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 5G and future 6G mobile networks become increasingly more sophisticated, the requirements for agility, scalability, resilience, and precision in real-time service provisioning cannot be met using traditional and heuristic-based resource management techniques, just like any advancing technology. With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</description>

      <title>FUSION: Forecast-Embedded Agent Scheduling with Service Incentive Optimization over Distributed Air-Ground Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a first-of-its-kind forecasting-driven, incentive-inherent service provisioning framework for distributed air-ground integrated networks that explicitly accounts for human-machine coexistence. In our framework, vehicular-UAV agent pairs (APs) are proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots to augment the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs), which in turn gives rise to a set of challenges that we jointly address: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HUs) and machine users (MUs). To address these challenges, we propose FUSION, a two-stage optimization framework, consisting of an offline stage and an online stage. In the offline stage, a liquid neural network-powered module performs multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism, to jointly determine ES-AP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate the congestion-aware task scheduling as a potential game among HUs, MUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAVs, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that FUSION consistently achieves higher social welfare and improved resource utilization, while maintaining latency and energy costs comparable to state-of-the-art baselines and preserving individual rationality, budget balance, and near-truthfulness.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where meeting strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoiding service instance overload becomes challenging. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics and overlook per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in the CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards: Each load balancer autonomously selects service instances to maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS requirements by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. Our load-balancing algorithm also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and changes in instance availability.</description>
