      <title>On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.</description>

      <title>EWOCS-IV: 1Ms ACIS Chandra observation of the supergiant B[e] star Wd1-9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars are exceptionally rare objects, with only a handful of confirmed examples in the Milky Way. The evolutionary pathways leading to the sgB[e] phase remain largely debated, highlighting the need for additional observations. The sgB[e] star Wd1-9, located in the massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1), is enshrouded in a dusty cocoon--likely the result of past eruptive activity--leaving its true nature enigmatic. We present the most detailed X-ray study of Wd1-9 to date, using X-rays that pierce through its cocoon with the aim to uncover its nature and evolutionary state. We utilize 36 Chandra observations of Wd1 from the 'Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey' (EWOCS), plus eight archival datasets, totalling 1.1 Ms. This dataset allows investigation of long-term variability and periodicity in Wd1-9, while X-ray colours and spectra are analysed over time to uncover patterns that shed light on its nature. Wd1-9 exhibits significant long-term X-ray variability, within which we identify a strong 14-day periodic signal. We interpret this as the orbital period, marking the first period determination for the system. The X-ray spectrum of Wd1-9 is thermal and hard (kT approximately 3.0 keV), resembling the spectra of bright Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries in Wd1, while a strong Fe emission line at 6.7 keV indicates hot plasma from a colliding-wind X-ray binary. Wd1-9, with evidence of past mass loss, circumbinary material, a hard X-ray spectrum, and a newly detected 14-day period, displays all the hallmarks of a binary--likely a WR+OB--that recently underwent early Case B mass transfer. Its sgB[e] classification is likely phenomenological reflecting emission from the dense circumbinary material. This places Wd1-9 in a rarely observed phase, possibly revealing a newly formed WN star, bridging the gap between immediate precursors and later evolutionary stages in Wd1.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales in Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: Relativistic Jet linking the Horizon to the Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim 10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx 2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$. This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$). From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin $a_*=0.9$.</description>

      <title>Afterglow Linear Polarization Signatures from Steep GRB Jets: Implications for Orphan Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe, and are powered by initially ultra-relativistic jets. The angular profile of GRB jets encodes important information about their launching and propagation near the central source, and can be probed through their afterglow emission. Detailed analysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed shows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core. The afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing angle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to degeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone. Such degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light curves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow linear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where most of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of the light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy structure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical approximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to that of a break in the light curve. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to determine the nature of orphan GRB afterglows, distinguishing between a quasi-spherical "dirty fireball" and a steep jets viewed far off-axis and apply them on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected orphan afterglow candidate AT2021lfa.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Probing the polarized emission from the accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1907+09 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the accretion-powered X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1907+09, conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) that delivers the first high-quality polarization measurements of this source. 4U 1907+09 was observed twice during its brightest periods close to the periastron. We observe a stronger polarization in the first observation, with the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) of $6.0 \pm 1.6\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $69^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. In contrast, the second observation provides weaker constraints on the polarimetric properties, with a PD=$2.2 \pm 1.6\%$ and a PA=$46^\circ \pm 23^\circ$, as determined from the spectral-polarimetric analysis. Combining the data from both observations results in a PD=$3.7 \pm 1.1\%$ and a PA=$63^\circ \pm 9^\circ$. We detect an energy-dependent PA in the phase-averaged analyses with a significance of 1.7 $\sigma$. In the phase-resolved analyses, we observe a potential PA rotation by approximately $90^\circ$ between adjacent energy bands (4--5 and 5--6 keV) within the single phase bin of 0.25--0.375. We also investigate the influence of short flares on the polarization properties of this source. The results suggest that flares do not significantly affect the energy-phase-dependent PA, implying that the pulsar's geometry remains stable during flare events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New results of modeling the operation of the new SPHERE-3 Cherenkov telescope are presented. The telescope will be able to detect cosmic particles by direct and reflected Cherenkov light of the extensive air showers (EAS). Dual detection improves the accuracy of determining the parameters of the primary particle. The study is based on the data bank of distributions of the EAS Cherenkov light obtained on the Lomonosov-2 supercomputer. The accuracy of determining the energy and type of the primary particle from the reflected and direct flux of Cherenkov light is estimated.</description>

      <title>Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars as high-energy neutrino sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high energy neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from flat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find that the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction (&gt; 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the "radio-quiet" (RQ) component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.</description>

      <title>The Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the ejecta rich nebulosity associated with the suspected runaway and binary Wolf-Rayet star WR~71 (HD 143414). In H$\alpha$ emission, the nebula appears as a crescent shaped, broken ring of clumpy emission some $9' \times 13'$ in angular size centered to the south and west of the WR star. At a Gaia estimated distance of 4.27 kpc, the nebula has physical dimensions of $11 \times 16$ pc making it one of the larger known ejecta rich WR ring nebulae. Our [O III] image also show considerable surrounding faint nebulosity much of which may be unrelated to the WR star. A comparison of the nebula's optical appearance with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows infrared coincidence with the nebula's brightest [O III] emission features. Deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images like those presented here suggests that new and substantially deeper imaging reconnaissance of WR star nebulae compared to earlier surveys may lead to additional WR ring nebula detections, thereby enhancing our understanding on the frequency and formation of WR ring nebulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.</description>

      <title>Results of 15-Year Pulsar Timing of PSR J0007+7303 with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In this paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly discovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three previously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9, with intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as 1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if the non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the crust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no exponential recovery is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission in the central starburst region of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR), radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements, which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest, most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR). Key features of our models are the identification of the &gt;50 GeV emission as pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum. This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR, and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody. Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the &gt;10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2) the 0.1 &lt; E/GeV &lt; 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight (and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the &lt;0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic, and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200 1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>Hyperonic degrees of freedom in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star mergers considering several different equations of state that include hyperons. By running a large set of simulations, we study the impact of the thermally produced hyperons on the gravitational-wave spectral features, the temperature evolution of the remnant, the mass ejecta and the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole. Models with hyperons tend to stand out in the relation between the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars. Moreover, the averaged temperature of the remnant is reduced for hyperonic models. The mass ejection of the mergers is tentatively enhanced when hyperons are present in comparison to nucleonic EoSs leading to similar stellar properties of cold neutron stars, whereas the threshold mass for prompt black-hole formation is reduced by about 0.05~$M_\odot$ compared to the nucleonic models.</description>

      <title>Identifying potential binary neutron star merger events from the Fermi GBM Gamma-Ray Burst Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts are expected to be associated with compact object mergers, such as binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole systems, and are key high-energy multimessenger events. The detection of GRB 170817A, coinciding with the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a BNS merger, confirmed the link between sGRBs and compact object mergers. Similarly, GRB 150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting its association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to uncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs from other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A and GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events from this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart. We employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed properties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we tested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the preferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar characteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with BNS mergers. Our analysis successfully identified a cluster of sGRBs events with characteristics consistent with sGRB merger-associated. A comparison between our sample of candidates and known kilonova candidates associated with sGRBs, identified through other methodologies, further validated our approach.</description>

      <title>Variable QPO lags and reduced coherence between the disc and corona in MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the hard state of many black hole X-ray binaries. Although their origin is unknown, they are strongly associated with the corona, of which the geometry is also subject to discussion. We present a thorough spectral-timing analysis of QPOs and broadband noise in the high-inclination BHXRB MAXI J1820+070, using the rich NICER data set of the source in the bright hard state of its outburst in 2018. We find that there is a large QPO hard lag between soft energy bands with significant disc emission and harder coronal power-law bands, which is absent when measuring lags between energy bands dominated by the coronal emission. The QPO lags between a soft band (with significant disc emission) and harder coronal power-law bands vary significantly with power-law flux, on time-scales of (tens of) seconds or a few QPO cycles, especially at QPO frequencies $\lesssim0.3$ Hz. At the same time, the QPO is found to be related to a decreased coherence between energy bands with significant disc emission and harder bands both at and below the QPO frequency, suggesting the QPO mechanism filters out part of the variability. Similar patterns in the frequency-dependent lags and coherence are observed in the BHXRB MAXI J1803-298, which is a (dipping) high-inclination source, but not in the low-inclination source GX 339-4. We suggest that these findings may be evidence of changes in the vertical extent of the corona on time-scales slightly longer than the QPO cycle.</description>

      <title>Gravitational pulsars: correlations between the electromagnetic and the continuous gravitational wave signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars emitting continuous gravitational waves may be regarded as gravitational pulsars, in the sense that it could be possible to track the evolution of their rotational period with long-baseline observations of next-generation gravitational wave interferometers. Assuming that the pulsar's electromagnetic signal is tracked and allows us to monitor the pulsar's spin evolution, we provide a physical interpretation of the possible observed correlation between this timing solution and its gravitational counterpart, if the system is also detected in gravitational waves. In particular, we show that next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, could have the sensitivity to discern different models for the coupling between the superfluid and normal components of the neutron star and constrain the origin of timing noise (whether due to magnetospheric or internal processes). Observational confirmation of one of the proposed scenarios would therefore provide valuable information on the physics of gravitational wave emission from pulsars.</description>

      <title>SST-1M Observations of Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) is the closest and one of the brightest high-frequency peaked blazars, located at a redshift of z = 0.031. It is a strong source of gamma rays, and its broadband emission has been extensively studied over the years through multi-wavelength observations from various telescopes. Mrk 421 has been a target of observational campaigns conducted by the SST-1M telescopes - two single-mirror small-size Cherenkov telescopes at Ondrejov Observatory, Prague, Czech Republic. These telescopes operate in mono and stereoscopic modes, utilizing the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) to detect Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays in the 1-300 TeV energy range. We present recent SST-1M observations, data analysis, and the results of preliminary physical modeling of Mrk 421's emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of $\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$. To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor neutrino oscillations using the Phase Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space Approximation (PSA) approach, originally applied in [Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino oscillations from a stellar object in the two-flavor limit, is extended here to describe the more realistic case where neutrinos can oscillate between three different flavors. The approach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight neutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides excellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the full problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a versatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling three-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino oscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300 neutrinos. Additionally, the method provides insight into the system's equilibration properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade Camera System is a novel calibration system designed to calibrate the IceCube detector by measuring the optical properties of the Antarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs, which are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules for the IceCube Upgrade. These units, deployed across the IceCube Upgrade volume, will capture transmission and reflection images that can be used to characterize the optical properties of both the refrozen ice within drill holes and the bulk ice between strings. Additionally, the images can aid in determining the positions of the optical modules the camera systems are mounted on. To maximize the systems performance, various image analysis methodologies have been explored, ranging from classical maximum likelihood estimation to AI-based approaches using neural networks. In this study, we present preliminary results on the performance of these methods based on images generated by a simulation tool developed specifically for this system.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-Driven Neutron-Rich Ejecta Unleashed: Global 3D Neutrino-General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Collapsars Probe the Conditions for r-process Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collapsars - rapidly rotating stellar cores that form black holes - can power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and are proposed to be key contributors to the production of heavy elements in the Universe via the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Previous neutrino-transport collapsar simulations have been unable to unbind neutron-rich material from the disk. However, these simulations have not included sufficiently strong magnetic fields and the black hole (BH), both of which are essential for launching mass outflows. We present $nu$H-AMR, a novel neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ($\nu$GRMHD) code, which we use to perform the first 3D global $\nu$GRMHD collapsar simulations. We find a self-consistent formation of a weakly magnetized dense accretion disk, which has sufficient time to neutronize. Eventually, substantial magnetic flux accumulates near the BH, becomes dynamically important, leads to a magnetically arrested disk (MAD), and unbinds some of the neutron-rich material. However, the strong flux also hinders accretion, lowers density, and increases neutrino cooling timescale, which prevents further disk neutronization. Typical collapsar progenitors with mass accretion rates, $\dot{M} \sim 0.1-1 M_\odot/\rm{s}$, do not produce significant neutron-rich ($Y_\text{e} &lt; 0.25$) ejecta. However, we find that MADs at higher mass accretion rates, $\dot{M} \gtrsim \text{few}\, M_\odot/\rm{s}$ (e.g., for more centrally concentrated progenitors), can unbind $M_\text{ej}\lesssim{}M_\odot$ of neutron-rich ejecta. The outflows inflate a shocked cocoon that mixes with the infalling neutron-poor stellar gas and raises the final outflow $Y_\text{e}$; however, the final $r$-process yield may be determined earlier at the point of neutron capture freeze-out. Future work will explore under what conditions more typical collapsar engines become $r$-process factories.</description>

Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Exploring Constraints on Axion-like Particles with the Observations for blazar Mrk 501</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillations between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons in astrophysical magnetic fields can lead to irregularities in the high energy gamma ray spectra of blazars. The magnetic field within the blazar jet plays a crucial role in shaping these effects, with its strength in the emission region being an important parameter determined by multi-wavelength observations. However, the origin of the high energy bump observed in the spectral energy distribution of some blazars is a topic of debate, with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios providing plausible explanations that result in different magnetic field strengths in the emission region. In this study, we investigate the impact of magnetic field configurations on the constraints of ALP parameters. We consider both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios for the blazar Mrk 501 and derive the corresponding jet magnetic field strengths. Additionally, we explore two jet magnetic field models: one with a toroidal component and the other with helical and tangled components. By analyzing the spectra of Mrk 501 observed by MAGIC and Fermi-LAT from 2017-06-17 to 2019-07-23, which are well-described by both emission scenarios, we derive constraints on the ALP parameters. Our results demonstrate that both the emission scenario and the magnetic field structure play a significant role in deriving these constraints, with the hadronic model leading to much more stringent limits compared to the leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Inferring CSM Properties of Type II SNe Using a Magnitude-Limited ZTF Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although all Type II supernovae (SNe) originate from massive stars possessing a hydrogen-rich envelope, their light curve morphology is diverse, reflecting poorly characterised heterogeneity in the physical properties of their progenitor systems. Here, we present a detailed light curve analysis of a magnitude-limited sample of 639 Type II SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. Using Gaussian processes, we systematically measure empirical light curve features (e.g. rise times, peak colours and luminosities) in a robust sampling-independent manner. We focus on rise times as they are highly sensitive to pre-explosion progenitor properties, especially the presence of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shed by the progenitor in the years immediately pre-explosion. By correlating our feature measurements with physical parameters from an extensive grid of STELLA hydrodynamical models with varying progenitor properties (CSM structure, $\dot M$, $R_{CSM}$ and $M_{ZAMS}$), we quantify the proportion of events with sufficient pre-explosion mass-loss to significantly alter the initial light curve (roughly $M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) in a highly complete sample of 377 spectroscopically classified Type II SNe. We find that 67 $\pm$ 6\% of observed SNe in our magnitude-limited sample show evidence for substantial CSM ($M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) close to the progenitor ($R_{CSM} &lt;10^{15}$ cm) at the time of explosion. After applying a volumetric-correction, we find 36$^{+5}_{-7}$\% of all Type II SN progenitors possess substantial CSM within $10^{15}$ cm at the time of explosion. This high fraction of progenitors with dense CSM, supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence of previous SNe, reveals mass-loss rates significantly exceeding those measured in local group red supergiants or predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts, but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGNs (SDSS DR16). We report preliminary evidence of an excess of lower-luminosity ($10^{44.5} \lesssim L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as lower-Eddington ratio ($0.01 \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results support the theoretical speculation that some LVK events come from lower-luminosity or lower-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} &lt; \theta &lt; 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Stars as Potential TeV Cosmic-Ray Accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic rays increasingly point to the existence of nearby sources - so-called "local tevatrons", capable of accelerating particles to TeV energies. In this study, we examine the potential of a typical main-sequence star, represented by the Sun, to act as a source of TeV cosmic rays (CRs). We focus on identifying plausible mechanisms through which a quiescent star can accelerate charged particles to relativistic energies. We show that shock-drift acceleration processes operating within the chromospheres of the Sun and similar stars can accelerate particles to energies reaching the TeV scale. Additionally, we provide quantitative estimates of both the maximum achievable particle energies, spectral index of energy spectrum and the resulting cosmic-ray fluxes that such stellar environments could realistically produce. Our results indicate that ordinary stars could potentially contribute to the fine structure observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum at TeV energies and may help explain the local excess of TeV-scale electrons and positrons detected by H.E.S.S. and other observatories.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology Estimation Tool in Gammapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of the energy dependence of gamma-ray sources can yield important information on the underlying emission mechanisms. However, despite the detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a proper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool within the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of gamma-ray data, to quantify the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray source. The proposed method for this estimation tool fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across all energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each energy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding methods, and the significance of variability is quantified by comparing the test statistic between the two hypotheses. We present a general tool to probe changes in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward folding approach with 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from H.E.S.S., and also on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of energy dependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises a subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower energies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates very significant variability (9.8{\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended emission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1{\deg}), simulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a statistically significant variation (9.7{\sigma}), despite the small scale.</description>

      <title>A New Gravitational Wave Probe to the Nature of Dark Energy from the Aging of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most dominant energy budgets in the Universe is Dark Energy, which remains enigmatic since its existence was first claimed based on observations of late-time cosmic acceleration. We propose a new way of inferring the dark energy equation of state (EoS) by measuring the aging of the Universe using only gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binary compact objects of any masses. We show that the behavior of dark energy as the Universe ages will lead to a change in the observed chirp mass of GW sources inferred from observations of different stages of their coalescence. This change can be studied by monitoring a coherent source over a few years, with two well-separated GW frequencies. With a coordinated network of GW detectors that can reach a sensitivity of Big Bang Observer, we can reach a $5\sigma$ detection of the dark energy EoS parameter $w_0=-1$ and its variation with cosmic time by using stellar origin binary black holes and binary neutron stars up to high redshift over 10 years of observation time without using any external calibrator. If the next generation of GW detectors can achieve this precision, then it can open a new window to discover the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity are focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group method and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$, or roughly -0.26 radians. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, asymmetric mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes factor in support of zero phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814. This implies our results are not strong enough to confidently argue if either event is a type II image, and is consistent with our statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) generate hundreds of thousands to millions of alerts, demanding automatic, unified classification of transients and variable stars for efficient follow-up. We present AppleCiDEr (Applying Multimodal Learning to Classify Transient Detections Early), a novel framework that integrates four key data modalities (photometry, image cutouts, metadata, and spectra) to overcome limitations of single-modality classification approaches. Our architecture introduces (i) two transformer encoders for photometry, (ii) a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain-specialized metadata towers and Mixture-of-Experts fusion for combining metadata and images, and (iii) a CNN for spectra classification. Training on ~ 30,000 real ZTF alerts, AppleCiDEr achieves high accuracy, allowing early identification and suggesting follow-up for rare transient spectra. The system provides the first unified framework for both transient and variable star classification using real observational data, with seamless integration into brokering pipelines, demonstrating readiness for the LSST era.</description>
