      <title>Dimension-Preserving Saturated Embeddings of Finite Posets into the Spectra of Noetherian UFDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $X$, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for there to exist a local Noetherian UFD $A$ and a saturated embedding of posets $\phi : X \longrightarrow \mbox{Spec}(A)$ such that $\dim(X)=\dim(A)$. The conditions imposed on $X$ in our characterization are remarkably mild, demonstrating that there is a large class of finite posets that can be embedded into the spectrum of a local Noetherian UFD of the same dimension as $X$ in a way that preserves saturated chains. We also show that given any finite poset $Y$, there exists a semi-local quasi-excellent ring $S$ and a saturated embedding $\psi: Y \longrightarrow \mbox{Spec}(S)$ such that if $z$ is a minimal element of $Y$, then $\psi(z)$ is a minimal prime ideal of $S$ and the coheight of $\psi(z)$ is the same as the length of the longest chain in $Y$ that starts at $z$ and ends at a maximal element of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Binomial edge ideals of crown graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the class of graphs for which the projective dimension of the quotient of the binomial edge ideals matches the big height of that ideal. Additionally, we investigate the Vasconcelos number of binomial edge ideals for cycles and crown graphs. We also provide proof for [Conjecture 4.13, 3], which is related to the Vasconcelos number of binomial edge ideals for cycles.</description>

      <title>Computing in complete local equicharacteristic Noetherian rings via topological rewriting on commutative formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commutative algebra, the theory of Gr\"obner bases enables one to compute in any finitely generated algebra over a given computable field. For non-finitely generated algebras however, other methods have to be pursued. For instance, it follows from the Cohen structure theorem that standard bases of formal power series ideals offer a similar prospect but for complete local equicharacteristic rings whose residue field is computable. Using the language of rewriting theory, one can characterise Gr\"obner bases in terms of confluence of the induced rewriting system. It has been shown, so far via purely algebraic tools, that an analogous characterisation holds for standard bases with a generalised notion of confluence. Subsequently, that result is utilised to prove that two generalised confluence properties, where one is actually in general strictly stronger than the other, are actually equivalent in the context of formal power series. In the present paper, we propose alternative proofs making use of tools purely from the new theory of topological rewriting to recover both the characterisation of standard bases and the equivalence between generalised confluence properties. The objective is to extend the analogy between Gr\"obner basis theory together with classical algebraic rewriting theory and standard basis theory with topological rewriting theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring and $M$ be an $R$-module such that the set of associated prime ideals of the quotient module $M/L$ is finite for all submodules $L$ of $M$. In this paper, it is shown that there is a finitely generated submodule $N$ of $M$ such that the set of associated primes of $M/N$ and the support of $M/N$ are equal.</description>

      <title>On the axioms for a unqiue factorization domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing evolution of the theory of non-unique factorization in integral domains and monoids, the study of several variations to the classical unique factorization domain (or UFD) property have become popular in the literature. Using one of these variations, the length-factorial property, it can be shown that part of the standard classical axioms used in the definition of a UFD is essentially superfluous.</description>

Abstract: We prove that over artinian stretched Gorenstein rings, the ideals of minors of a minimal free resolution of any finitely generated module are eventually 2-periodic. This is an analog of results obtained over complete intersections and Golod rings proved by Brown, Dao, and Sridhar.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Model for Coherent Sheaves over Noetherian Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme is very important for studying the properties of a given scheme. For noetherian schemes it is a well-known fact that the topology can be fully recovered from the corresponding partially ordered set of its points together with the specializaion partial order. Here we show that the same thing holds for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme, i.e. there exists an equivalent description of this category in the "language" of this poset. First we build the equivalent notion of the structure sheaf, then we introduce the desired functor from the category of coherent sheaves to a certain category of presheaves over it, show this functor is fully faithful, describe its essential image and hence find an equivalent category for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme. This paper is based on the author's master's thesis.</description>

      <title>Generalizing blocking semiovals in finite projective planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blocking semiovals and the determination of their (minimum) sizes constitute one of the central research topics in finite projective geometry. In this article we introduce the concept of blocking set with the $r_\infty$-property in a finite projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$, with $r_\infty$ a line of $\text{PG}(2,q)$ and $q$ a prime power. This notion greatly generalizes that of blocking semioval. We address the question of determining those integers $k$ for which there exists a blocking set of size $k$ with the $r_\infty$-property. To solve this problem, we build new theory which deeply analyzes the interplay between blocking sets in finite projective and affine planes.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid signature, perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, and an application to local fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a (perfectoid) mixed characteristic version of $F$-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity by utilizing the perfectoidization functor of Bhatt-Scholze and Faltings' normalized length (also developed in the work of Gabber-Ramero). We show that these definitions coincide with the classical theory in equal characteristic $p &gt; 0$. We prove that a ring is regular if and only if either its perfectoid signature or perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is 1 and we show that perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity characterizes BCM closure and extended plus closure of $m$-primary ideals. We demonstrate that perfectoid signature detects BCM-regularity and transforms similarly to $F$-signature or normalized volume under quasi-\'etale maps. As a consequence, we prove that BCM-regular rings have finite local \'etale fundamental group and also finite torsion part of their divisor class groups. Finally, we also define a mixed characteristic version of relative rational signature, and show it characterizes BCM-rational singularities.</description>

Abstract: We give a constructive proof of the general Nullstellensatz: a univariate polynomial ring over a commutative Jacobson ring is Jacobson. This theorem implies that every finitely generated algebra over a zero-dimensional ring or the ring of integers is Jacobson, which has been an open problem in constructive algebra. We also prove a variant of the general Nullstellensatz for finitely Jacobson rings.</description>

      <title>The Rees algebra and analytic spread of a divisorial filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some properties of Rees algebras of divisorial filtrations and their analytic spread. A classical theorem of McAdam shows that the analytic spread of an ideal $I$ in a formally equidimensional local ring is equal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an associated prime of $R/\overline{I^n}$ for some $n$. We show in Theorem 1.5 that McAdam's theorem holds for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over an excellent local ring of dimension less than or equal to 3. This generalizes an earlier result for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does not hold for more general filtrations.
  We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function $n\mapsto \lambda_R(R/I_n)$ for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ of $m_R$-primary ideals on a $d$-dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is known from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity $$ e(\mathcal I)=d! \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(R/I_n)}{n^d} $$ can be irrational. We show in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function $$ \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(I_n/I_{n+1})}{n^{d-1}} $$ is always finite for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration. We then give an example in Section 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit.
  In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration $\{P^{(n)}\}$ of a prime ideal $P$ in a normal two dimensional excellent local ring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic powers $P^{(n)}$ of $P$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>The fiber-full scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the fiber-full scheme which can be seen as the parameter space that generalizes the Hilbert and Quot schemes by controlling the entire cohomological data. The fiber-full scheme $\text{Fib}_{\mathcal{F}/X/S}^\mathbf{h}$ is a fine moduli space parametrizing all quotients $\mathcal{G}$ of a fixed coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on a projective morphism $f:X \subset \mathbb{P}_S^r \rightarrow S$ such that $R^i{{f}_*}\left(\mathcal{G}(\nu)\right)$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_S$-module of rank equal to $h_i(\nu)$, where $\mathbf{h} = (h_0,\ldots,h_r) : \mathbb{Z}^{r+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^{r+1}$ is a fixed tuple of functions. In other words, the fiber-full scheme controls the dimension of all cohomologies of all possible twistings, instead of just the Hilbert polynomial. We show that the fiber-full scheme is a quasi-projective $S$-scheme and a locally closed subscheme of its corresponding Quot scheme. In the context of applications, we demonstrate that the fiber-full scheme provides the natural parameter space for arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay and arithmetically Gorenstein schemes with fixed cohomological data, and for square-free Gr\"obner degenerations.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical invariant for line bundles and its applications in algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of hierarchical depth for line bundles on smooth projective surfaces, defined via filtrations by line subbundles with successive quotients supported on effective divisors. This invariant helps to investigate both the algebraic and geometric complexity of line bundles through discrete stepwise constructions. We study some of its basic properties, including functorial behavior under restriction to curves and compatibility with ampleness and base-point freeness. Applying this framework to algebraic geometry (AG) codes, we show that hierarchical filtrations yield natural code families whose combinatorial parameters (dimension, minimum distance) evolve predictably across the filtration.</description>
