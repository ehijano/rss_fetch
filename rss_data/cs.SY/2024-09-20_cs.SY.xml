      <title>Optimal Control for Discrete-Time Systems under Bounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to the optimal control of linear discrete-time systems subject to bounded disturbances. Our approach is based on the newly established duality between ellipsoidal approximations of reachable and hardly observable sets. We provide exact solutions for state-feedback control and filtering problems, aligning with existing methods while offering improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our main contribution is the optimal solution to the output-feedback control problem for discrete-time systems which was not known before. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of this result over previous sub-optimal ones.</description>

      <title>On Convergent Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its Equivalence with Occupation Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new technique for norm-convergent dynamic mode decomposition of deterministic systems. The developed method utilizes recent results on singular dynamic mode decomposition where it is shown that by appropriate selection of domain and range Hilbert spaces, the Liouville operator (also known as the Koopman generator) can be made to be compact. In this paper, it is shown that by selecting appropriate collections of finite basis functions in the domain and the range, a novel finite-rank representation of the Liouville operator may be obtained. It is also shown that the model resulting from dynamic mode decomposition of the finite-rank representation is closely related to regularized regression using the so-called occupation kernels as basis functions.</description>

      <title>Excitable Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (E-NOD) for Agile Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Excitable Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (E-NOD), which describe opinion-forming and decision-making behavior with superior "agility" in responding and adapting to fast and unpredictable changes in context, environment, or information about available options. E-NOD is derived by introducing a single extra term to the previously presented Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD), which have been shown to enable fast and flexible multi-agent behavior. This extra term is inspired by the fast-positive, slow-negative mixed-feedback structure of excitable systems. The agile behaviors resulting from the excitable nature of decision-making driven by E-NOD are analyzed in a general setting and illustrated through an application to robot navigation around human movers.</description>

      <title>Wing Optimisation for a tractor propeller driven Micro Aerial Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes an investigation of the possible benefits from wing optimisation in improving the performance of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). As an example we study the Avion (3.64 kg mass, 1.60 m span), being designed at the CSIR National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru. The optimisation is first carried out using the methodology described by Rakshith \emph{et al.} (using an in\textendash house software PROWING), developed for large transport aircraft, with certain modifications to adapt the code to the special features of the MAV. The chief among such features is the use of low Reynolds number aerofoils with significantly different aerodynamic characteristics on a small MAV. These characteristics are taken from test data when available, and/or estimated by the XFOIL code of Drela. A total of 8 optimisation cases are studied for the purpose, leading to 6 different options for new wing planforms (and associated twist distributions along the wing span) with an improved performance. It is found that the improvements in drag coefficient using the PROWING code are about 5%. However, by allowing the operating lift coefficient $C_L$ to float within a specified range, drag bucket characteristics of the Eppler E423 aerofoil used on Avion can be exploited to improve the endurance, which is a major performance parameter for Avion. Thus, compared to the control wing $W_0$ (with operating point at $C_L$ =0.7) used in the preliminary design, permitting a variation of $C_L$ over a range of $\pm$ 10% is shown to enhance the endurance of wing $W_4$ by 18.6%, and of wing $W_{6}$ with a permitted $C_L$ range of $\pm$ 50% by 39.2%. Apart from the philosophy of seeking optimal operating conditions for a given configuration, the advantages of optimising design parameters such as washout of a simple wing proposed in the preliminary design stage, is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Optimization for Real-Time Control with Application to Locomotion Gait Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a common tool for the control of nonlinear, real-world systems, such as legged robots. However, solving MPC quickly enough to enable its use in real-time is often challenging. One common solution is given by real-time iterations, which does not solve the MPC problem to convergence, but rather close enough to give an approximate solution. In this paper, we extend this idea to a bilevel control framework where a "high-level" optimization program modifies a controller parameter of a "low-level" MPC problem which generates the control inputs and desired state trajectory. We propose an algorithm to iterate on this bilevel program in real-time and provide conditions for its convergence and improvements in stability. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm by applying it to a quadrupedal robot where the high-level problem optimizes a contact schedule in real-time. We show through simulation that the algorithm can yield improvements in disturbance rejection and optimality, while creating qualitatively new gaits.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Filtering for Discrete-Time Systems with Infinite-Dimensional Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems equipped with modern sensing modalities such as vision and lidar gain access to increasingly high-dimensional measurements with which to enact estimation and control schemes. In this article, we examine the continuum limit of high-dimensional measurements and analyze state estimation in linear time-invariant systems with infinite-dimensional measurements but finite-dimensional states, both corrupted by additive noise. We propose a linear filter and derive the corresponding optimal gain functional in the sense of the minimum mean square error, analogous to the classic Kalman filter. By modeling the measurement noise as a wide-sense stationary random field, we are able to derive the optimal linear filter explicitly, in contrast to previous derivations of Kalman filters in distributed-parameter settings. Interestingly, we find that we need only impose conditions that are finite-dimensional in nature to ensure that the filter is asymptotically stable. The proposed filter is verified via simulation of a linearized system with a pinhole camera sensor.</description>

      <title>Linear Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors with An Analytically Derived Koopman Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a Koopman-theoretic lifted linear parameter-varying (LPV) system with countably infinite dimensions to model the nonlinear dynamics of a quadrotor on SE(3) for facilitating control design. The LPV system evolves in time in the space of the observables, called the lifted space. A primary challenge in utilizing the Koopman-based linearization is identifying a set of observables that can adequately span the lifted space, with the majority of the current methods using data to learn these observables. In this study, we analytically derive the observables for the quadrotor dynamics on SE(3) to formulate the lifted LPV system. The lifted LPV system has a countably infinite dimension which is then truncated for practical control design. The truncation is analytically justified by showing vanishing residual property in a bounded trajectory regime. The LPV system is then approximated as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with a set of virtual control inputs. The controllability of the lifted LTI system is translatable to the true quadrotor system on SE(3). A linear model-predictive control (LMPC) scheme is formulated and implemented in numerical simulations employing this LTI framework for various tracking problems, with attention given to the potential for real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Incremental Composition of Learned Control Barrier Functions in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safely exploring a static and unknown environment while learning valid control barrier functions (CBFs) from sensor data. Existing works either assume known environments, target specific dynamics models, or use a-priori valid CBFs, and are thus limited in their safety guarantees for general systems during exploration. We present a method for safely exploring the unknown environment by incrementally composing a global CBF from locally-learned CBFs. The challenge here is that local CBFs may not have well-defined end behavior outside their training domain, i.e. local CBFs may be positive (indicating safety) in regions where no training data is available. We show that well-defined end behavior can be obtained when local CBFs are parameterized by compactly-supported radial basis functions. For learning local CBFs, we collect sensor data, e.g. LiDAR capturing obstacles in the environment, and augment it with simulated data from a safe oracle controller. Our work complements recent efforts to learn CBFs from safe demonstrations -- where learned safe sets are limited to their training domains -- by demonstrating how to grow the safe set over time as more data becomes available. We evaluate our approach on two simulated systems, where our method successfully explores an unknown environment while maintaining safety throughout the entire execution.</description>

      <title>Robust Model-Free Control Framework with Safety Constraints for a Fully Electric Linear Actuator System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-free control strategy for a complex multi-stage gearbox electromechanical linear actuator (EMLA) system, driven by a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with non-ideal ball screw characteristics. The proposed control approach aims to (1) manage user-specified safety constraints, (2) identify optimal control parameters for minimizing tracking errors, (3) ensure robustness, and (4) guarantee uniformly exponential stability. First, this paper employs a trajectory-setting interpolation-based algorithm to specify the piecewise definition of a smooth and jerk-bounded reference trajectory. Then, a dual robust subsystem-based barrier Lyapunov function (DRS-BLF) control is proposed for the PMSM-powered EMLA system to track the reference motions, guaranteeing user-specified safety related to constraints on system characteristics and alleviating control signal efforts. This methodology guarantees robustness and uniform exponential convergence. Lastly, optimal control parameter values are determined by customizing a swarm intelligence technique known as the Jaya (a term derived from the Sanskrit word for `victory') algorithm to minimize tracking errors. Experimental results validate the performance of the DRS-BLF control.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Real-Time Multi-Objective Charging Schedule Optimization For Electric Vehicle Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in car rental services is gaining momentum around the world and most commercial fleets are expected to fully adopt EVs by 2030. At the moment, the baseline solution that most fleet operators use is a Business as Usual (BAU) policy of charging at the maximum power at all times when charging EVs. Unlike petrol prices that are fairly constant, electricity prices are more volatile and can vary vastly within several minutes depending on electricity supply which is influenced by intermittent energy supplies like renewable energy and increased demand due to electrification in many industrial sectors including transportation. The battery in EVs is the most critical component as it is the most expensive component to replace and the most dangerous component with fire risks. For safe operation and battery longevity it is imperative to prevent battery capacity fade whenever the EVs are under the control of the fleet operator such as during charging.Fundamentally, the fleet operator would like to service as much demand as possible to maximize the revenue generated at a particular time instance.This is achieved by minimizing the EVs time spent on charging and thereby increasing their availability for rides.The three goals of reducing charging cost, battery capacity fade and maximizing ride availability are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The formulation is tested using the Gurobi solver on two cases from the real-world ACN dataset involving low and high EV charging densities over a week long period. The results of the proposed solution show 33.3% reduction in peak electricity loading period, 53.2% savings in charging cost and 16% lower battery capacity fade for the fleet operator.</description>

      <title>From Data to Control: A Formal Compositional Framework for Large-Scale Interconnected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compositional data-driven methodology for designing fully-decentralized safety controllers applicable to large-scale interconnected networks, encompassing subsystems with unknown mathematical models. Our compositional scheme leverages the interconnection topology and breaks down the network analysis into the examination of distinct subsystems. This is accompanied by utilizing a concept of control storage certificates (CSCs) to capture joint dissipativity-type properties among subsystems. These CSCs are instrumental in a compositional derivation of a control barrier certificate (CBC) specialized for the interconnected network, thereby ensuring its safety. In our data-driven scheme, we gather solely one input-output trajectory from each unknown subsystem within a specified time frame. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, this process facilitates the construction of a CSC for each subsystem. Following this, by adhering to compositional dissipativity reasoning, we compose CSCs derived from data and build a CBC for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven approach significantly enhances the design of a CBC and its safety controller across the interconnected network. This advancement is achieved by reducing the computational complexity from a polynomial growth in relation to network dimension, when using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, to a linear scale based on the number of subsystems. We additionally demonstrate that the dissipativity-type compositionality condition can benefit from the structure of interconnection topology and potentially be fulfilled regardless of the number of subsystems. We apply our data-driven findings to a variety of benchmarks, involving physical networks with unknown models and diverse interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Frisking-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes fixed competition that is manifested through a constant weight that each agent gives to its initial opinion in addition to its contribution through a consensus dynamic. This letter investigates the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We show that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We evaluate this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. If competition is not uniform across clients, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate and validate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Robust Trajectory Planning of Multiple Aerial Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on robust trajectory planning for autonomous agents aims to mitigate uncertainties arising from disturbances and modeling errors while ensuring guaranteed safety. Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Greenhouse Climate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms of crop yield and resource efficiency. One promising approach is model predictive control (MPC), which leverages a model of the system to optimize the control inputs, while enforcing physical constraints. However, prediction models for greenhouse systems are inherently inaccurate due to the complexity of the real system and the uncertainty in predicted weather profiles. For model-based control approaches such as MPC, this can degrade performance and lead to constraint violations. Existing approaches address uncertainty in the prediction model with robust or stochastic MPC methodology; however, these necessarily reduce crop yield due to conservatism and often bear higher computational loads. In contrast, learning-based control approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), can handle uncertainty naturally by leveraging data to improve performance. This work proposes an MPC-based RL control framework to optimize the climate control performance in the presence of prediction uncertainty. The approach employs a parametrized MPC scheme that learns directly from data, in an online fashion, the parametrization of the constraints, prediction model, and optimization cost that minimizes constraint violations and maximizes climate control performance. Simulations show that the approach can learn an MPC controller that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of constraint violations and efficient crop growth.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description>

      <title>Constructing Noise-Robust Quantum Gates via Pontryagin's Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable quantum information technologies depend on precise actuation and techniques to mitigate the effects of undesired disturbances such as environmental noise and imperfect calibration. In this work, we present a general framework based in geometric optimal control theory to synthesize smooth control pulses for implementing arbitrary noise-robust quantum gates. The methodology applies to generic unitary quantum dynamics with any number of qubits or energy levels, any number of control fields, and any number of disturbances, extending existing dynamical decoupling approaches that are only applicable for limited gate sets or small systems affected by one or two disturbances. The noise-suppressing controls are computed via indirect trajectory optimization based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, eliminating the need to make heuristic structural assumptions on parameterized pulse envelopes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Extremum Seeking Control via the RMSprop Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) is a well-known set of continuous time algorithms for model-free optimization of a cost function. One issue for ESCs is the convergence rates of parameters to extrema of unknown cost functions. The local convergence rate depends on the second, or sometimes higher, order derivatives of the unknown cost function. To mitigate this dependency, we propose the use of the RMSprop optimizer for ESCs as RMSprop is an adaptive gradient-based optimizer which attempts to have a normalized convergence rate in all parameters. Practical stability results are given for this RMSprop ESC (RMSpESC). In particular notability, the proof of practical stability uses Lyapunov function based on observed contracting, attractive sets. Versions of this Lyapunov function could be applied to other areas of applications, in particular for interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Closing the Loop in Robotic Pollination for Indoor Farming via Autonomous Microscopic Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective pollination is a key challenge for indoor farming, since bees struggle to navigate without the sun. While a variety of robotic system solutions have been proposed, it remains difficult to autonomously check that a flower has been sufficiently pollinated to produce high-quality fruit, which is especially critical for self-pollinating crops such as strawberries. To this end, this work proposes a novel robotic system for indoor farming. The proposed hardware combines a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator arm with a custom end-effector, comprised of an endoscope camera, a 2-DOF microscope subsystem, and a custom vibrating pollination tool; this is paired with algorithms to detect and estimate the pose of strawberry flowers, navigate to each flower, pollinate using the tool, and inspect with the microscope. The key novelty is vibrating the flower from below while simultaneously inspecting with a microscope from above. Each subsystem is validated via extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>GraspSAM: When Segment Anything Model Meets Grasp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasp detection requires flexibility to handle objects of various shapes without relying on prior knowledge of the object, while also offering intuitive, user-guided control. This paper introduces GraspSAM, an innovative extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), designed for prompt-driven and category-agnostic grasp detection. Unlike previous methods, which are often limited by small-scale training data, GraspSAM leverages the large-scale training and prompt-based segmentation capabilities of SAM to efficiently support both target-object and category-agnostic grasping. By utilizing adapters, learnable token embeddings, and a lightweight modified decoder, GraspSAM requires minimal fine-tuning to integrate object segmentation and grasp prediction into a unified framework. The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including Jacquard, Grasp-Anything, and Grasp-Anything++. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility of GraspSAM in handling different types of prompts (such as points, boxes, and language), highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in real-world robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Safe Visuomotor Policy Synthesis using Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern robotics, addressing the lack of accurate state space information in real-world scenarios has led to a significant focus on utilizing visuomotor observation to provide safety assurances. Although supervised learning methods, such as imitation learning, have demonstrated potential in synthesizing control policies based on visuomotor observations, they require ground truth safety labels for the complete dataset and do not provide formal safety assurances. On the other hand, traditional control-theoretic methods like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability provide formal safety guarantees but depend on accurate knowledge of system dynamics, which is often unavailable for high-dimensional visuomotor data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach to synthesize a semi-supervised safe visuomotor policy using barrier certificates that integrate the strengths of model-free supervised learning and model-based control methods. This framework synthesizes a provably safe controller without requiring safety labels for the complete dataset and ensures completeness guarantees for both the barrier certificate and the policy. We validate our approach through distinct case studies: an inverted pendulum system and the obstacle avoidance of an autonomous mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Angular Divergent Component of Motion: A step towards planning Spatial DCM Objectives for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) method is expanded to include angular coordinates for the first time. This work introduces the idea of spatial DCM, which adds an angular objective to the existing linear DCM theory. To incorporate the angular component into the framework, a discussion is provided on extending beyond the linear motion of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model (LIPM) towards the Single Rigid Body model (SRBM) for DCM. This work presents the angular DCM theory for a 1D rotation, simplifying the SRBM rotational dynamics to a flywheel to satisfy necessary linearity constraints. The 1D angular DCM is mathematically identical to the linear DCM and defined as an angle which is ahead of the current body rotation based on the angular velocity. This theory is combined into a 3D linear and 1D angular DCM framework, with discussion on the feasibility of simultaneously achieving both sets of objectives. A simulation in MATLAB and hardware results on the TORO humanoid are presented to validate the framework's performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Cooperative Output Regulation of Continuous-Time Multi-Agent Systems with Unknown Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven cooperative output regulation for continuous-time multi-agent systems with unknown network topology. Unlike existing studies that typically assume a known network topology to directly compute controller parameters, a novel approach is proposed that allows for the computation of the parameter without prior knowledge of the topology. A lower bound on the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is estimated using only edge weight bounds, enabling the output regulation controller design to be independent of global network information. Additionally, the common need for state derivative measurements is eliminated, reducing the amount of data requirements. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the data are informative for cooperative output regulation, leading to the design of a distributed output regulation controller. For the case with noisy data, the bound of the output error is provided, which is positively correlated with the noise bound, and a distributed controller is constructed for the approximate cooperative output regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions on Bipartite Consensus of Weakly Connected Matrix-weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bipartite consensus, a scenario where agents are divided into two disjoint sets with agents in the same set agreeing on a certain value and those in different sets agreeing on opposite or specifically related values, have highlighted its potential applications across various fields. Traditional research typically relies on the presence of a positive-negative spanning tree, which limits the practical applicability of bipartite consensus. This study relaxes that assumption by allowing for weak connectivity within the network, where paths can be weighted by semidefinite matrices. By exploring the algebraic constraints imposed by positive-negative trees and semidefinite paths, we derive sufficient conditions for achieving bipartite consensus. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Aggregate Flexibility of EV Charging Stations for Dependable Congestion Management Products: A Dutch Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probability of offering specific grid services by different categories of charging stations (CS) is analysed. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. The ability to offer different flexibility products, namely re-dispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed using various dispatch strategies. Next, machine learning models are used to predict the probability of CSs being able to deliver these products, accounting for uncertainties. Results indicate that residential charging locations have significant potential to provide both products during evening peak hours. While shared EVs offer better certainty regarding arrival and departure times, their small fleet size currently restricts their ability to meet the minimum order size of flexible products.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous systems, the safety and reliability of the system components are fundamental requirements. These components are often vulnerable to complex and unforeseen environments, making natural edge-case generation essential for enhancing system resilience. This paper presents GENESIS-RL, a novel framework that leverages system-level safety considerations and reinforcement learning techniques to systematically generate naturalistic edge cases. By simulating challenging conditions that mimic the real-world situations, our framework aims to rigorously test entire system's safety and reliability. Although demonstrated within the autonomous driving application, our methodology is adaptable across diverse autonomous systems. Our experimental validation, conducted on high-fidelity simulator underscores the overall effectiveness of this framework.</description>

      <title>Tiered Service Architecture for Remote Patient Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a remote patient monitoring (RPM) service architecture, which has two tiers of monitoring: ordinary and intensive. The patient's health state improves or worsens in each time period according to certain probabilities, which depend on the monitoring tier. The patient incurs a "loss of quality of life" cost or an "invasiveness" cost, which is higher under intensive monitoring than under ordinary. On the other hand, their health improves faster under intensive monitoring than under ordinary. In each period, the service decides which monitoring tier to use, based on the health of the patient. We investigate the optimal policy for making that choice by formulating the problem using dynamic programming. We first provide analytic conditions for selecting ordinary vs intensive monitoring in the asymptotic regime where the number of health states is large. In the general case, we investigate the optimal policy numerically. We observe a threshold behavior, that is, when the patient's health drops below a certain threshold the service switches them to intensive monitoring, while ordinary monitoring is used during adequately good health states of the patient. The modeling and analysis provides a general framework for managing RPM services for various health conditions with medically/clinically defined system parameters.</description>

      <title>Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors in active inference agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-time behaviour of the popular temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm when combined with tail-averaging. We derive finite time bounds on the parameter error of the tail-averaged TD iterate under a step-size choice that does not require information about the eigenvalues of the matrix underlying the projected TD fixed point. Our analysis shows that tail-averaged TD converges at the optimal $O\left(1/t\right)$ rate, both in expectation and with high probability. In addition, our bounds exhibit a sharper rate of decay for the initial error (bias), which is an improvement over averaging all iterates. We also propose and analyse a variant of TD that incorporates regularisation. From analysis, we conclude that the regularised version of TD is useful for problems with ill-conditioned features.</description>

      <title>MA-VAE: Multi-head Attention-based Variational Autoencoder Approach for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series Applied to Automotive Endurance Powertrain Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A clear need for automatic anomaly detection applied to automotive testing has emerged as more and more attention is paid to the data recorded and manual evaluation by humans reaches its capacity. Such real-world data is massive, diverse, multivariate and temporal in nature, therefore requiring modelling of the testee behaviour. We propose a variational autoencoder with multi-head attention (MA-VAE), which, when trained on unlabelled data, not only provides very few false positives but also manages to detect the majority of the anomalies presented. In addition to that, the approach offers a novel way to avoid the bypass phenomenon, an undesirable behaviour investigated in literature. Lastly, the approach also introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. The results are presented in the context of a real-world industrial data set and several experiments are undertaken to further investigate certain aspects of the proposed model. When configured properly, it is 9% of the time wrong when an anomaly is flagged and discovers 67% of the anomalies present. Also, MA-VAE has the potential to perform well with only a fraction of the training and validation subset, however, to extract it, a more sophisticated threshold estimation method is required.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Learning for the Linear Quadratic Regulator over Rate-Limited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem being solved in a model-free manner using the policy gradient approach. If the gradient of the quadratic cost is being transmitted across a rate-limited channel, both the convergence and the rate of convergence of the resulting controller may be affected by the bit-rate permitted by the channel. We first pose this problem in a communication-constrained optimization framework and propose a new adaptive quantization algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (AQGD). This algorithm guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with no deterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting, above a certain finite threshold bit-rate allowed by the communication channel. We then propose a variant of AQGD that provides similar performance guarantees when applied to solve the model-free LQR problem. Our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the literature on compressed optimization. Our work also marks a first step towards a more general bridge between the fields of model-free control design and networked control systems.</description>

      <title>Task and Domain Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in simulation domains, yet its application in designing robot controllers remains limited, due to its single-task orientation and insufficient adaptability to environmental changes. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel adaptive agent that leverages transfer learning techniques to dynamically adapt policy in response to different tasks and environmental conditions. The approach is validated through the blimp control challenge, where multitasking capabilities and environmental adaptability are essential. The agent is trained using a custom, highly parallelized simulator built on IsaacGym. We perform zero-shot transfer to fly the blimp in the real world to solve various tasks. We share our code at https://github.com/robot-perception-group/adaptive_agent.</description>

      <title>Online Model-based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series: Taxonomy, Survey, Research Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>High Probability Latency Sequential Change Detection over an Unknown Finite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is studied, in which the goal is to minimize a delay threshold (latency), under constraints on the probability of false alarm and the probability that the latency is exceeded. In addition, the horizon is not known to the change detector. A variant of the cumulative sum (CuSum) test with a threshold that increasing logarithmically with time is proposed as a candidate solution to the problem. An information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum value of the latency under the constraints is then developed. This lower bound is used to establish certain asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed test in terms of the horizon and the false alarm probability. Some experimental results are given to illustrate the performance of the test.</description>

      <title>Mission Planning on Autonomous Avoidance for Spacecraft Confronting Orbital Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mission planning problem for spacecraft confronting orbital debris to achieve autonomous avoidance. Firstly, combined with the avoidance requirements, a closed-loop framework of autonomous avoidance for orbital debris is proposed. Under the established model of mission planning, a two-stage planning is proposed to coordinate the conflict between routine tasks and debris avoidance. During the planning for expansion, the temporal constraints for duration actions are handled by the ordering choices. Meanwhile, dynamic resource variables satisfying instantaneous numerical change and continuous linear change are reasoned in the execution of actions. Linear Programming (LP) can solve the bounds of variables in each state, which is used to check the consistency of the interactive constraints on duration and resource. Then, the temporal relaxed planning graph (TRPG) heuristics is rationally developed to guide the plan towards the goal. Finally, the simulation demonstrates that the proposed mission planning strategy can effectively achieve the autonomous debris avoidance of the spacecraft.</description>
