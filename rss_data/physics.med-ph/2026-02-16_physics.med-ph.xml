      <title>Maximum-Likelihood--Based Position Decoding of Laser Processed Converging Pixel CsI: Tl Detectors for High-Resolution SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel fabrication technique for high spatial resolution CsI: Tl scintillation detectors tailored for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems. Building upon our previously developed laser induced optical barrier (LIOB) method, which achieved high spatial resolution, excellent sensitivity, and 100% fabrication yield in CsI: Tl detectors, we extend this approach to a converging-pixel architecture. A CsI: Tl crystal array with converging pixels was designed and fabricated, featuring entrance-face pixels of 1.6x1.6 mm2 and photodetector side pixels of 2x2 mm2. To localize gamma-ray interactions, both the center of gravity (CoG) algorithm and a maximum-likelihood (ML) based decoding method were implemented. A custom built four axis motion platform was developed to deliver a finely collimated pencil beam at precisely controlled positions and angles across the array, enabling generation of a comprehensive dataset for prior knowledge and validation. The results demonstrate an energy resolution of 11.79+/-0.53% (collimated experiment) and a position localization accuracy of 1.00+/-0.42 mm (nearest neighbor interpolation), confirming that the proposed converging-pixel architecture, combined with statistical decoding algorithms, provides a promising path toward the development of high-performance SPECT detectors.</description>

      <title>A Wavefield Correlation Approach to Improve Sound Speed Estimation in Ultrasound Autofocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aberration often degrades ultrasound image quality when beamforming does not account for wavefront distortions. In the past decade, local sound speed estimators have been developed for distributed aberration correction throughout a medium. Recently, iterative sound speed optimization approaches have achieved more accurate estimates than earlier approaches, but these newer methods still struggle with decreased accuracy for media with reverberation clutter and large sound speed changes. To address these challenges, we propose using a wavefield correlation (WFC) beamforming approach when performing sound speed optimization. WFC correlates simulated forward-propagated transmit wavefields and backwards-propagated receive wavefields in order to form images. This process more accurately models wave propagation in heterogeneous media and can decrease diffuse clutter due to its spatiotemporal matched filtering effect. This beamformer is implemented using auto-differentiation software to then perform gradient descent optimization, using a total-variation regularized common midpoint phase focus metric loss, on the local sound speed map used during beamforming. This approach is compared to using delay and sum (DAS) with straight-ray time delay calculations in the same sound speed optimization approach on a variety of simulated, phantom, and in vivo data with large sound speed changes and clutter. Results show that using WFC decreases sound speed estimation error, and using the estimates for aberration correction improves image resolution and contrast. These promising results have potential to improve pulse-echo imaging for challenging clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound-Guided Real-Time Spinal Motion Visualization for Spinal Instability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Spinal instability is a widespread condition that causes pain, fatigue, and restricted mobility, profoundly affecting patients' quality of life. In clinical practice, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic X-ray imaging. However, X-ray provides only 2D motion information, while 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cannot efficiently capture motion. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of visualizing real-time 3D spinal motion while minimizing radiation exposure.
  Methods: We propose ultrasound as an auxiliary modality for 3D spine visualization. Due to acoustic limitations, ultrasound captures only the superficial spinal surface. Therefore, the partially compounded ultrasound volume is registered to preoperative 3D imaging. In this study, CBCT provides the neutral spine configuration, while robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed at maximal spinal bending. A kinematic model is applied to the CBCT-derived spine model for coarse registration, followed by ICP for fine registration, with kinematic parameters optimized based on the registration results. Real-time ultrasound motion tracking is then used to estimate continuous 3D spinal motion by interpolating between the neutral and maximally bent states.
  Results: The pipeline was evaluated on a bendable 3D-printed lumbar spine phantom. The registration error was $1.941 \pm 0.199$ mm and the interpolated spinal motion error was $2.01 \pm 0.309$ mm (median).
  Conclusion: The proposed robotic ultrasound framework enables radiation-reduced, real-time 3D visualization of spinal motion, offering a promising 3D alternative to conventional dynamic X-ray imaging for assessing spinal instability.</description>

      <title>Image-based investigation of the zebrafish developmental process using in vivo dynamic and multi-contrast optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate in vivo dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) imaging of zebrafish development from 2 weeks to 12 months post-fertilization, integrated with polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), and histological validation. Two DOCT algorithms were utilized: logarithmic intensity variance and late OCT correlation decay speed, which characterize the occupancy of dynamic scatterers and their motion speeds, respectively. Our results show that skin stripes exhibit high DOCT signals and it varies among the pigment-cell types. Furthermore, the combination of DOCT and PS-OCT captures the maturation of these stripes. In addition, DOCT and OCTA successfully visualized the developmental progression of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as spinal tissues.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Atlas Registration for Melanoma Brain Metastases: Preserving Pathology While Enabling Cohort-Level Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are common and spatially heterogeneous lesions, complicating cohort-level analyses due to anatomical variability and differing MRI protocols. We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.
  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.
  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.
  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies.</description>

      <title>SDE-based Monte Carlo dose calculation for proton therapy validated against Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the accuracy and computational performance of a stochastic differential equation (SDE)--based model for proton beam dose calculation by benchmarking against Geant4 in simplified phantom geometries. Approach: Building on Crossley et al. (2025), we implemented the SDE model using standard approximations to interaction cross sections and mean excitation energies, enabling straightforward adaptation to new materials and configurations. The model was benchmarked against Geant4 in homogeneous, longitudinally heterogeneous and laterally heterogeneous phantoms to assess depth--dose behaviour, lateral transport and material heterogeneities. Main results: Across all phantoms and beam energies, the SDE model reproduced the main depth--dose characteristics predicted by Geant4, with proton range agreement within 0.2 mm for 100 MeV beams and 0.6 mm for 150 MeV beams. Voxel--wise comparisons yielded gamma pass rates exceeding 95% under 2%/0.5 mm criteria with a 1% dose threshold. Differences were localised to steep dose gradients or material interfaces, while overall lateral beam dispersion was well reproduced. The SDE model achieved speed-up factors of about 2.5--3 relative to single-threaded Geant4. Significance: The SDE approach reproduces key dosimetric features with good accuracy at lower computational cost and is amenable to parallel and GPU implementations, supporting fast proton therapy dose calculations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiopharmaceutical therapies are expanding rapidly, but clinical evidence generation is limited by operational constraints and biological heterogeneity in radiopharmaceutical delivery and radiation risk. Virtual theranostic trials can run as companion trials, linking quantitative imaging to patient-specific models to generate evidence for personalized injections and scheduling, accelerate development, and broaden access.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can guide the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several end-to-end learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach that does not require any k-space training data, relying solely on image-domain datasets, a large part of which can be unpaired. Additionally, our approach provides an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem based on the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Consequently, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to a simple replacement of the aliased content of the reconstruction iterate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-CoSMo. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the public NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset, showing improved generalizability compared to end-to-end methods, and on two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, offering up to 32.6\% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM.</description>
