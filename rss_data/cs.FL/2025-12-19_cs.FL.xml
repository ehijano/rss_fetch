      <title>Automated Formalization of Probabilistic Requirements from Structured Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating autonomous and adaptive behavior into software-intensive systems presents significant challenges for software development, as uncertainties in the environment or decision-making processes must be explicitly captured. These challenges are amplified in safety- and mission-critical systems, which must undergo rigorous scrutiny during design and development. Key among these challenges is the difficulty of specifying requirements that use probabilistic constructs to capture the uncertainty affecting these systems. To enable formal analysis, such requirements must be expressed in precise mathematical notations such as probabilistic logics. However, expecting developers to write requirements directly in complex formalisms is unrealistic and highly error-prone. We extend the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with support for the specification of unambiguous and correct probabilistic requirements, and develop an automated approach for translating these requirements into logical formulas. We propose and develop a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic. To increase trust in our formalizations, we provide assurance that the generated formulas are well-formed and conform to the intended semantics through an automated validation framework and a formal proof. The extended FRET tool enables developers to specify probabilistic requirements in structured natural language, and to automatically translate them into probabilistic temporal logic, making the formal analysis of autonomous and adaptive systems more practical and less error-prone.</description>

      <title>A Formal Modular Synthesis Approach for the Coordination of 3-D Robotic Construction with Multi-robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to build 3-D structures. This problem consists of a set of mobile robots that interact with each other in order to autonomously build a predefined 3-D structure. Our approach is based on Supervisory Control Theory, and it allows us to synthesize from models that represent a single robot and the target structure a correct-by-construction reactive controller, called supervisor. When this supervisor is replicated for the other robots, then the target structure can be completed by all robots</description>
